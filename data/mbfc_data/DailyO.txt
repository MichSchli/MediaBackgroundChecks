Analysis / Bias
According to
[The Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-wire-india/), “most newspapers in India would be completely unprofitable were it not for government advertising and other kinds of rent that they are able to collect. [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/here-s-what-modi-spent-to-sell-the-india-story-around-the-world), “India’s Government spent $640 million on advertisements.” Therefore, media must be close to the ruling government. Further, paid news, which is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_news_in_India) as an “organized practice in Indian newspapers and other media outlets, where news space and favorable coverage is exchanged for money” is still [practiced.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44280188)
As of 2016, DailyO published articles with a critical tone regarding Narendra Modi (Current Prime Minister and right-wing nationalist party
[BJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) leader), such as this [“Shame on Modi for using fake videos to pit students against farmers.”](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/jnu-videos-rss-hindutva-farmer-suicides-kisan-suvidha-smartphone-app/story/1/9771.html) However, they currently publish articles with a pro-Narendra Modi tone: [“How an empowered rural economy forms the bedrock of the Modi govt’s long-term strategies for 2022”.](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modinomics-how-an-empowered-rural-economy-forms-the-bedrock-of-the-modi-government-s-long-term-strategies-for-2022/story/1/30553.html) They also publish anti-opposition articles such as these: [“Amar Singh: ‘Priyanka is definitely better than Rahul Gandhi. But I know the next PM is Modi, Modi and only Modi’”](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/amar-singh-narendra-modi-will-be-next-pm-jaya-prada-rampur-congress-up-priyanka-gandhi-rahul-gandhi-sp-bsp-sexism/story/1/30539.html) and [“The ‘D’ Delusion: What the collective Congress meltdown says about India’s feudal family politics.”](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/congress-rahul-gandhi-dynastic-politics-bjp-narendra-modi/story/1/31402.html) Further, The Wire India [reports](https://thewire.in/media/angshukanta-chakraborty-dailyo-india-today), in 2018, that the India Today Group fired DailyO political editor Angshukanta Chakraborty due to an opinion she expressed in a tweet that was critical of the ruling government.
When covering world news about the USA, they publish stories critical of the former Trump administration:
[“H1B visa: How Trump is making life miserable for Indian IT professionals in America”](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/h1b-visa-nris-indian-it-industry-donald-trump-visa-immigration-xenophobia/video/1/21572.html) and [ “Xi Jinping and Trump are having a bad year. Modi isn’t, and he should capitalize on it during the G20 Summit”](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/g20-summit-narendra-modi-g20-summit-xi-jinping-donald-trump-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-g20-summit-tokyo-us-iran-tensions-india-defense-strategy/story/1/31285.html). When it comes to sourcing, DailyO sources from the India Today group, such as Business Today and Mail Today; however, most of the articles are opinions and poorly sourced. They occasionally utilize credible sources such as [ndtv.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ndtv/) and [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/).
