History
[Founded in 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Apologetics_and_Research_Ministry), the Christian Research Ministry is a [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) organization in the United States. The founder and President of CARM is Matthew J. Slick. According to their about page, “The Christian ministry is dedicated to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ and the promotion and defense of the Christian Gospel, doctrine, and theology. In all our analyses, we use the Bible as the final standard of truth in order to defend and promote Christianity.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Before we begin the analysis, I think it is important to know what a Christian Apologist does. Quite simply, they are a branch of Christian theology that defends Christianity against objections through the use of the Bible, pseudoscience, philosophy, and moral persuasion. There are many types of apologetics that you can learn about
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics).
In review, CARM provides information on various topics that they claim are supported or refuted by the bible. For example, they are
[anti-abortion](https://carm.org/abortion) and [quote passages](https://carm.org/what-does-the-bible-say-about-abortion) from the bible as a defense. They also provide resources to [persuade or defend](https://carm.org/atheism) against atheists. When it comes to homosexuality, they again use the [bible as a resource](https://carm.org/homosexuality) for their opposition to gay marriage or homosexual relations. Lastly, they [do not support the theory of evolution](https://carm.org/secular-movements/creation-evolution-debate/darwins-dangerous-idea) and provide resources for their followers to argue claims against creationism. In general, there is very little evidence-based content on this website.
