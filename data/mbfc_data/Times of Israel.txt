Analysis / Bias
In review, The Times of Israel covers Israeli and regional news with minimally loaded language such as this:
[US envoy suggests world should rethink PA aid after Israeli teen killed by bomb](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoys-condemn-savage-west-bank-bombing-that-killed-teenage-girl/). This particular story relies on Twitter as the primary source. In another report, [Ex-Iraqi PM warns Israel of ‘strong response’ if it proves to be behind strikes](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-iraqi-pm-warns-israel-of-strong-response-if-it-proves-to-be-behind-strikes/), the primary source is the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). The Times of Israel also relies on news agencies for content, such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and the [Jewish Telegraphic Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency-jta/).
The website also features a blog with a wide variety of writers. The blog posts tend to use more emotional wording and are generally opinion-oriented. A review of several blog posts indicates a left-leaning editorial bias with articles such as this:
[What Trump really (maybe) meant by calling Jewish Democrats ‘disloyal’](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/what-trump-really-maybe-meant-by-calling-jewish-democrats-disloyal/).
When covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they usually are objective and cover both sides fairly, such as this:
[IDF strikes fresh Hamas targets after 2nd rocket fired from Gaza Strip](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-strikes-fresh-hamas-targets-after-2nd-rocket-fired-from-gaza-strip/). However, during the conflict of 2023, they were [less objective](https://www.timesofisrael.com/footage-shows-numerous-gaza-terror-suspects-who-apparently-surrendered-to-idf-troops/), focusing on the objectives of the Israeli military. In general, the Times of Israel is factual with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
