Analysis / Bias
Determining the bias of a news aggregator is different than from a single source that produces original content. The wording on Apple News comes from other sources, so we will not even look at that as a factor. The most logical way to determine the bias of a news aggregator is to look at the sources they use for their news content.
We reviewed 100 news articles calculating whether the source is Left, Left-Center, Least Biased, Right-Center, or Right Biased by comparing them to our bias ratings and calculating what percentage comes from each bias category. Overall, most stories on Apple News come from Left-Center sources (60%) and 20% from least biased sources. Further, Right-Center sources only made up 8% of the news and Right biased less than 4%, while on the other hand, 8% of stories come from the left-biased category. When looking at purely left-leaning vs. right-leaning sources, the numbers greatly favor the left. See the charts below:
- Left-Leaning 68%
- Right-Leaning 12%
All categories:
- Left 8%
- Left-Center 60%
- Least Biased 20%
- Right-Center 8%
- Right 4%
Out of the 100 articles reviewed, 12 came from sources we rate as factually mixed.
We are not stating Apple is willfully biased; we are pointing out that the sources used have a strong preference for the left according to our ratings. This could be due to how the algorithm works and more mainstream news media leans left.
