Analysis / Bias
While eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red meats is scientifically beneficial, Dr. Greger takes it to a higher level promoting a 100% plant-based diet. According to the
[Science-Based Medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/science-based-medicine/) website, Dr. Greger and NutritionFacts.org makes “zealot” like claims about the benefits of a vegan plant-based diet. In their article, Science-Based Medicine [debunks one by one,](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/death-as-a-foodborne-illness-curable-by-veganism/) many of Dr. Gregers claims. They also claim that NutritionFacts cherry-picks information that will always favor veganism. NutritionFacts.org does provide some valuable information, and indeed, a diet high in fruits and vegetables is preferred, but Dr. Greger’s claims are extreme.
