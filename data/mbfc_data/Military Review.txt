Analysis / Bias
Military Review or TopWar.ru features the following sections: News, Weaponry, History, Opinions, Analytics, and Video.
The website primarily covers military and geopolitical issues from a Russian perspective, such as this article titled
[“Finnish Navy on the eve of joining NATO,”](https://en.topwar.ru/212665-finskie-vms-v-preddverii-vstuplenija-v-nato.html) which presents information about the Finnish navy’s size, equipment, and composition. However, the article lacks specific sources to support its claims and doesn’t provide a clear author or editorial team responsible for its content. Therefore the information presented is unreliable.
Furthermore, the website publishes articles with strong, emotionally loaded words, such as
[“Berlin Chronicles: how Germany was left defenseless.”](https://en.topwar.ru/212457-berlinskie-hroniki-kak-germanija-ostalas-bez-zaschity.html) The article discusses Germany’s current military defenses and dependence on NATO allies for protection, ultimately attributing these factors to the country’s limited military capabilities.
Regarding sourcing, it sources
[Die Zeit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/die-zeit/) by saying, “According to Die Zeit, the country is not protected from the air, the shelters are in a deplorable state, and the public emergency warning system does not work.” But no hyperlink was provided.
Editorially, the website tends to have a pro-Russian bias and frequently criticizes the policies of the United States and its allies. For example, a quote from the article reads, “There is nothing surprising in this – NATO countries a priori calculated their arsenals and supplies for one month of active hostilities.”
While the website does provide analysis and commentary on a wide range of military and geopolitical issues, its perspective is consistently pro-Russian. Finally, fact-checker
[Polygraph.info](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/polygraph-info/) describes [Miliary Review](https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-disinfo-analyses-kremlin-control-internet/6741818.html) as it “Promotes radical nationalistic ideas and portrays Russian military capabilities as the world’s most advanced.” In general, Military Review is a pro-Russian Government propaganda site that has published misinformation and is restricted by government censorship.
