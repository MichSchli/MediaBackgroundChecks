Analysis / Bias
In review, NowThis News reports political news with a strong liberal/progressive leaning bias, heavily relying on meme culture and soundbites, often omitting certain key facts spoken in video clips. There is the use of loaded emotional headlines that favor the left, such as this:
[Bill Nye the Science Guy on Trump’s Climate Change Denial](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/bill-nye-the-science-guy-on-trumps-climate-change-denial).
NowThis News favors more progressive Democrats with flattering headlines like this:
[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gives Inspiring Speech at Bernie Sanders Town Hall](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-at-bernie-sanders-town-hall). In general, they support progressive candidates over establishment Democrats and routinely denigrate the right.
