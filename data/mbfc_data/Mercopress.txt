Analysis / Bias
In review, MercoPress republishes summarized news from other sources such as this
[Japan plans to catch some 383 large whales this season](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/12/26/japan-plans-to-catch-some-383-large-whales-this-season). This story originates from [Japan Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/japan-today/), without [proper citations](https://japantoday.com/category/national/japan-sets-whaling-catch-limit-for-2021-at-383-same-as-2020) indicating it is not original. Articles and headlines sometimes contain emotionally loaded language such as this [“Trump issues new pardons for crooks and including the father of his son in law Jared Kushner.”](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/12/26/trump-issues-new-pardons-for-crooks-and-including-the-father-of-his-son-in-law-jared-kushner?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_content=main&utm_campaign=rss&fbclid=IwAR0nEVZZ-TvHG4ZePUhgmx_DnvHZRHAxPSNOciXeFD97A5PMkfWxNth6lj0) The wording of this story is [very similar](https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-pardons-spark-outrage-01608750612) to an article written by [Barron’s Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/barrons/) 3 days earlier.
Although the tagline reads “South Atlantic News Agency,” most reporting is on the European Union and
[UK news](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/), such as this [Johnson will travel to India next month, first trip since departure from the EU.](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/12/16/johnson-will-travel-to-india-next-month-first-trip-since-departure-from-the-eu) They also frequently report on the Falkland Islands, which consists of mainly English-speaking Brits such as this [Boris Johnson assures he will raise the Falklands’ issue at the EU.](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/12/11/boris-johnson-assures-he-will-raise-the-falklands-issue-at-the-eu) When it comes to the sourcing of information, they don’t. While they are not directly plagiarizing other sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), the wording is very similar and used without credit. You can compare stories, MercoPress [UK variant of coronavirus is up to 70% more transmissible, but no sufficient evidence that it is more lethal,](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/12/21/uk-variant-of-coronavirus-is-up-to-70-more-transmissible-but-no-sufficient-evidence-that-it-is-more-lethal) while Reuters reports, [FACTBOX-UK says new coronavirus variant up to 70% more transmissible](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-britain-variant-detai/factbox-uk-says-new-coronavirus-variant-up-to-70-more-transmissible-idUSL8N2IZ0H7). The wording is almost identical to Reuters originally reporting the story a day earlier.
Editorially, MercoPress does not produce op-eds; they don’t produce any original reporting. When covering politics, they cover primarily British politics that hold negative views toward Brexit, such as this
[Scotland claims the post-Brexit trade accord was “a bad deal for fishing](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/12/26/scotland-claims-the-post-brexit-trade-accord-was-a-bad-deal-for-fishing).” In general, the news is reported factually and from reliable sources; however, MercoPress does not credit these sources and provides little transparency about who they are; therefore, the information provided may be questionable without investigating the original source.
