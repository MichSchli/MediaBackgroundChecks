Analysis / Bias
In review, Patriotic Express is a hyper-partisan conservative blog that routinely publishes news with severely loaded headlines that favor the right:
[Trump Drops The HAMMER On Comedian Who Made Fun Of Sarah Sanders](https://patrioticexpress.com/trump-drops-the-hammer-on-comedian-who-made-fun-of-sarah-sanders/) and [List Emerges Of 653 Times Liberals Attacked Or Threatened Republicans Since 2015.](https://patrioticexpress.com/list-emerges-of-653-times-liberals-attacked-or-threatened-republicans-since-2015/) This last article is [sourced](http://archive.vn/SttWl#selection-293.1-855.89) to a forum post by some individual named [Peter Dâ€™Abrosca](https://archive.vn/o/SttWl/https://threadreaderapp.com/user/pdabrosca). Although, Patriotic Express usually provides a hyperlinked source to their stories, their opinions often take the information out of context to favor the right or President Trump.
In general, Patriotic Express attempts to source their information to credible media reports, however, wording and story selection always favors the right and denigrate the left.
