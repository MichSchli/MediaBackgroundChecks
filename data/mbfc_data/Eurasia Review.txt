History
Launched in 2009, Eurasia Review is a news and analysis site on world events and politics. Eurasia Review contributors are an international community of writers, bloggers, digital activists, think tanks, and academics.
[Robert Steven Duncan](http://www.eurasiareview.com/about/) is the general manager. Eurasia Review has a long list of contributors; although we couldn’t go through all of the [contributor’s lists](http://www.eurasiareview.com/authors/), we identified some contributors listed that either have no contributions, such as [Business Intelligence Journal](http://www.eurasiareview.com/author/business-intelligence-journal/) or has only 2 articles written, such as [Michael Moore](http://www.eurasiareview.com/author/michael-moore/). Eurasia Review states its [mission](http://www.eurasiareview.com/about-2/) is to “provide a venue for analysts and experts to disseminate content on a wide range of subjects that are often overlooked or under-represented by Western-dominated media.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Eurasia Review utilizes credible sources such as
[Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), and [Huffington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/) However, some articles utilize local sources such as The North Africa Post, Civil Georgia, and more of the mentioned region or country that we have no way of verifying credibility. Further, Eurasia Review uses minimally loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles, such as “ [Foreign Ministers Agree New Areas Of NATO-EU Cooperation](http://www.eurasiareview.com/06122017-foreign-ministers-agree-new-areas-of-nato-eu-cooperation/) and they sometimes use large blocks of quotations without providing links to their sources.
Eurasia Review publishes analysis from the right-leaning
[Mises Institute](http://www.eurasiareview.com/06122017-why-the-deep-state-is-at-war-with-trump-analysis/), which is a libertarian think tank described by the [Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/mainstream) as a “major center promoting libertarian political theory and the Austrian School of free-market economics, pioneered by the late economist Ludwig von Mises.” They also publish articles from the left-leaning [Popular Resistance](https://popularresistance.org/). [Margaret Flowers](http://www.eurasiareview.com/author/margaret-flowers/), who is a healthcare reform activist and co-founder of [Popular Resistance](http://www.keywiki.org/index.php?title=Popular_Resistance&action=edit&redlink=1); and [Kevin Zeese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Zeese). Kevin Zeese ran for the [US Senate](http://www.eurasiareview.com/14112017-people-act-where-us-fails-on-climate-oped/), where both Greens and Libertarians nominated Zeese for Maryland Senate in 2006. In general, story selection is balanced and factual.
