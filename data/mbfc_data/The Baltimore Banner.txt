[“DeSantis uses Baltimore crime as a dog whistle to dodge his own bullets,”](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/opinion/column/desantis-crime-baltimore-florida-WCSXD7OQ6BBKPOA5UQTKA344WM/) the author uses emotionally loaded language to criticize [Florida Governor Ron DeSantis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-political-bias-profile/) for deflecting from his state’s crime issues by focusing on Baltimore, suggesting a bias in the title and content. A quote from the article reads, “During his technologically shaky presidential campaign announcement on Twitter Spaces,” focusing on DeSantis negatively.
