History
Launched in 2019, NewsReady is an anonymously run conservative news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://www.newsready.com/about-us/), “The onslaught of fake news financed by the corrupt minority and distributed by the mainstream media has become increasingly difficult to fight. Americans are constantly overwhelmed by an onslaught of fake news and do not have time to fact check everything they see online or on TV.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not name authors, editors or clearly indicate who owns the website.

Funded by / Ownership
NewsReady does not clearly indicate who owns the website. For example, on the contact page, they indicate the contact as Beachside Media, Inc. A search for
[Beachside Media](https://www.beachsidemedia.net/contact-us/) reveals that Rob Greenstein is the owner. On their Terms page, they describe [Earnware Corporation](https://www.earnware.com/) as the owner. Earnware is a digital marketing company. Regardless, they lack transparency in ownership. Revenue is derived through advertising and sponsored content.
Analysis / Bias
In review, NewsReady provides news summaries from a far-right conservative perspective. The frequent use of highly emotional language denigrates the left, such as this
[Ocasio-Cortez and Democrats Unveil New Scheme](https://www.newsready.com/ocasio-cortez-and-democrats-unveil-new-scheme/) and [Did Obama Commit Treason?](https://www.newsready.com/did-obama-commit-treason/) On the other hand, they often praise the right, particularly former President Donald Trump, such as this [Here’s How Trump Has Improved International Standing](https://www.newsready.com/heres-how-trump-has-improved-international-standing/). All of the stories listed above and the others reviewed lacked hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, NewsReady is primary a far-right biased opinion website that is not always factual. For example, during the 2020 Presidential Election, they amplified election fraud claims such as this
[Newt Gingrich Says 2020 Election Might Be Biggest Theft Since 1824](https://www.newsready.com/newt-gingrich-says-2020-election-might-be-biggest-theft-since-1824/). As of this date, there has not been any evidence presented in court to [substantiate voter fraud](https://www.wsj.com/articles/election-fraud-claims-a-state-by-state-guide-11609962846). Finally, they also amplified false information that was not corrected when it turned out not to be true: [Senator Josh Hawley Says His Wife Was Threatened](https://www.newsready.com/senator-josh-hawley-says-his-wife-was-threatened/). This story is [false.](https://factcheck.afp.com/police-and-video-contradict-senators-claim-antifa-attack-his-home) In general, NewsReady reports news that is not always factual and with a far-right editorial bias.
