Analysis / Bias
In review, New Nation Newsâ€™s sole purpose is to post news about crimes committed by people of color. They also frequently target Hispanics and Muslims in their negative reporting. The website does not publish original content but rather aggregates it from other sources. The website also has a forum that can only be described as pure hate. In this review, we will not be linking to the articles or the forum due to the nature of the content. The mission of this website is to show that people of color are dangerous and a threat to whites. This is one of the most overtly racist websites I have reviewed. I provide a link below, but I caution against clicking on it.
