Analysis / Bias
Reporters Without Borders has
[reported](https://rsf.org/en/iran) Iran as “One of the most oppressive countries” According to a Reporters Without Borders 2019 report, Iran ranks 170 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
According to their
[ about page](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/106998/) “International daily newspaper, [Tehran Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tehran-times/) with more than three decades of its publication is affiliated with MNA.” The Tehran Times is known as a [Pro-Government](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/media-guide.html) media outlet. The President of Iran, [Hassan Rouhani](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22886729) has moved to the left, placing himself with the reformists during the elections, but he is still the leader of the [Moderation and Development Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_and_Development_Party), which is classified as “moderate reformists” “modernist right” or “Republican Right.”
In review, the content of headlines and articles uses loaded words pertaining to national news, such as
[“US ‘failed global leader’ after USSR collapse”](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/121902/US-failed-global-leader-after-USSR-collapse) and [“Jewish MP says Iranian Jews ready, united to defend Iran.”](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/134451/Jewish-MP-says-Iranian-Jews-ready-united-to-defend-Iran) Further, they poorly source their articles by either heavily quoting or utilizing factually mixed right-biased Iranian sources such as [Tasnim](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tasnim-news-agency/), [Tehran Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tehran-times/), and Russian propaganda news media company [Sputnik News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/)
In general, Mehr is a right-leaning pro-Government propaganda outlet that is not always factual.
