Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the content, Talk TV publishes news articles with a right-leaning bias in story selection. For example, the article titled
[“Piers Morgan: We’re Sick and Tired of woke companies telling us we’re Evil”](https://talk.tv/news/24103/piers-morgan-coutts-nigel-farage-woke-companies-snow-white-disney-budd-light-dylan-mulvaney) is written by Piers Morgan for TalkTV. The article criticizes what Morgan perceives as the ‘woke’ culture of various companies, including Coutts Bank, Ben & Jerry’s, Bud Light, Maybelline, Adidas, and Disney. The article lacks hyperlinks to external sources, relying instead on the author’s commentary. The language is loaded, showing a clear bias against ‘woke’ culture, as evidenced by statements such as “And we’re sick and tired of woke companies telling us we’re evil.” This statement is a clear example of loaded language that shows a bias against companies promoting social and political messages.
Another article,
[“Liverpool Women’s Hospital: Ladies’ toilets open to men who identify as Women,”](https://talk.tv/top-stories/24121/liverpool-womens-hospital-ladies-toilets-open-to-men-who-identify-as-women) discusses a controversial issue related to gender identity. The article presents the issue in a neutral tone. Still, the choice of topic could be seen as appealing to a right-leaning audience interested in debates about gender identity and transgender rights.
The website also has a section for opinion pieces, which are clearly labeled as such. These pieces reflect a variety of perspectives, but there is a noticeable emphasis on conservative viewpoints such as
[Nigel Farage: Coutts closed bank account over views on Brexit, Donald Trump and gender ideology](https://talk.tv/news/23874/nigel-farage-coutts-closed-bank-account-over-views-on-brexit-donald-trump-and-gender-ideology). They have also promoted climate denialism, which is opposed to the consensus of science, as evidenced by failed fact checks below.
In terms of sourcing, Talk TV does not consistently provide hyperlinks to external sources within its articles. This makes it difficult for readers to verify the information presented. In general, they hold right-leaning conservative biases and are not always factual in reporting.
Failed Fact Checks
[Global warming is natural, CO2 has no provable effect on the climate, the greenhouse effect is negligible, and computer models used to measure climate change are skewed.](https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32GX2YQ)– False [“We are about 1 degree Celsius above the coldest it’s been in the last 10,000 years” and “that’s why we shouldn’t be panicking.”](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/may/17/instagram-posts/a-claim-full-of-hot-air-earths-temperature-histori/)– False
In conclusion, we rate Talk TV as Right Biased based on story selection and editorial perspectives that favor conservative issues. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the lack of consistent sourcing, failed fact checks, and views that do not align with the consensus of science. (M. Huitsing 07/25/2023)
