Analysis / Bias
In its reporting, FrontPage Newspaper often highlights sensational topics, such as crime stories. For instance, articles like
[“2 Bodies Found in Woods”](https://frontpagenewspaper.com/2023/10/2-bodies-found-in-woods/) and [“18 Dead in Mass Shooting”](https://frontpagenewspaper.com/2023/10/18-dead-in-mass-shooting/) are prominently featured. FrontPage maintains a generally straightforward approach in their reporting and tends to focus on crime stories. With regards to sourcing, FrontPage Newspaper cites external sources, including [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), [The Independent UK, ](about:blank) [AP,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Fox News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/)
We also analyzed some political reports. For example, an article on Trump’s 2024 plans, titled
[“Trump’s 2024 Plan to Crush the “Deep State” and Revive a Controversial Policy.”](https://frontpagenewspaper.com/2023/05/trumps-2024-plan-to-crush-the-deep-state-and-revive-a-controversial-policy/) contains emotionally loaded language, using terms like ‘Deep State’ and ‘Crush,’ which could appeal to readers who hold suspicions about governmental institutions, often a sentiment found in conservative circles. The article discusses the policy impartially, but the citation of NBC News is misleading as it redirects to a general page unrelated to the topic.
Another article we analyzed,
[“Biden Confronted About Pardons For Trump,](https://frontpagenewspaper.com/2023/06/biden-confronted-about-pardons-for-trump/) cites [Yahoo News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/) and the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). While the article appears neutral, the description of Biden’s ‘chuckle’ and avoidance of a direct answer could be interpreted in various ways, depending on the reader’s perspective. However, in general, more articles are sympathetic toward former [President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as this: [Bombshell Report Reveals Who Ratted Out Trump.](https://frontpagenewspaper.com/2023/08/mark-meadows-begins-collaboration-with-smiths-prosecutors/) While stories are primarily fact-based, there is a right-leaning editorial bias that sometimes relies on sources who have failed fact-checks.
