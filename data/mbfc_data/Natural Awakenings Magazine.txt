Analysis / Bias
In review, Natural Awakenings Magazine covers natural health and holistic practices. Besides offering alternative health information they also write articles on green living and pet health. Articles do not contain loaded language such as this
[Wishful Recycling: What Not To Put In The Bin](https://www.naturalawakenings.com/2020/09/30/327733/wishful-recycling-what-not-to-put-in-the-bin). According to [Quackwatch](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quackwatch/) this is a [non-recommended periodical due to pseudoscience](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/nonrecperiodicals/). Our research indicates that they do not overtly promote alternative [cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), but they do promote diets that are not proven to be effective such as this [Try Vitamins And Garlic To Lower Gastric Cancer Risk](https://www.naturalawakenings.com/2020/02/28/297042/try-vitamins-and-garlic-to-lower-gastric-cancer-risk). Further, they promote [ ant-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) such as this. In general, this is a strong pseudoscience website.
