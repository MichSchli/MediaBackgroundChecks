History
The Alaska Beacon is an online news website from Alaska. Their
[about](https://alaskabeacon.com/about/) statement reads, “The Alaska Beacon is an independent, nonpartisan news organization focused on connecting Alaskans to their state government. Alaska, like many states, has seen a decline in the coverage of state news. We aim to reverse that.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, the Alaska Beacon is part of
[States Newsroom](https://statesnewsroom.com/about/), a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit [supported by grants and a coalition of donors and readers](https://statesnewsroom.com/support/). States Newsroom publishes 28 other [publications](https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/). The Alaska Beacon is transparent as they link to the States Newsroom donors page. Initially, when they launched, they got fiscal sponsorship from the Hopewell Foundation; however, once the IRS approved their application for 501(c)(3) charity certification, they severed their ties with Hopewell Foundation. There has been criticism of their involvement with [the Hopewell Foundation,](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/mysterious-funders-behind-new-arizona-media-outlet-10870282) and they have responded to the criticism [here](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/a-few-friday-thoughts-on-what-the-arizona-mirror-is-and-isnt/).
Analysis / Bias
The Alaska Beacon publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Alaska. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects the people of Alaska. Articles and headlines promote liberal perspectives through moderate, loaded language
[Crab crisis in Bering Sea a sign of ‘borealization’ and big changes in the future, scientists warn](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/02/06/crab-crisis-in-bering-sea-a-sign-of-borealization-and-big-changes-in-the-future-scientists-warn/).
They properly source, linking to credible sources such as
[whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), and bls.gov (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Editorially, opinion pieces favor the left, such as this
[Alaska’s environmental standards are not some of the best](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/02/03/alaskas-environmental-standards-are-not-some-of-the-best/). On the issues, the Alaska Beacon promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change. Finally, they frequently report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [U.S. House Republicans go to bat for wealthy tax cheaters and against the national interest](https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/01/25/u-s-house-republicans-go-to-bat-for-wealthy-tax-cheaters-and-against-the-national-interest/). The Alaska Beacon generally reports news factually; however, story selection and op-eds strongly favor a liberal perspective.
