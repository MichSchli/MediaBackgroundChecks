Analysis / Bias
In review, the Denver Westword covers entertainment, the
[marijuana industry](https://www.westword.com/marijuana), and Denver/Colorado news. News reporting features minimally loaded language such as this: [There’s Just One Medical Doctor at Immigration Detention Facility in Aurora](https://www.westword.com/news/theres-just-one-medical-doctor-for-detainees-at-immigration-facility-in-aurora-11246966). They also publish long-form journalism such as this: [Coloradans Battle Frackers for Control of Their Back Yards](https://www.westword.com/news/coloradans-battle-frackers-for-control-of-their-back-yards-11207326). All information in articles is properly sourced.
Editorially, Westword favors left-leaning policies such as marijuana legalization, pro-environment policy, and social equality. However, they present information in a mostly balanced way and with only moderate use of loaded language.
