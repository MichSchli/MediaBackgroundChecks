Analysis / Bias
[Freedomhouse.org](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/taiwan) indicates Taiwan’s media environment as one of the freest in Asia by and Taiwan’s constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, and the [Freedom House](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-house/) report indicates that the government in general respects this protection.
In review, The China Post uses some loaded language in their local reports but maintains factual reporting such as in this article:
[China: The land of fabricated papers and fake peer reviews](http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/2017/08/10/499926/p1/china-the.htm). They utilize minimal loaded words in their articles and they do present low biased coverage of the USA, however, they do sometimes use sensational headlines such as [Trump revived an old ‘pigs blood’ myth in response to the Barcelona attack](http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/americas/2017/08/18/500081/trump-revived.htm) and [Bannon says Trump administration rivals are ‘wetting themselves’](http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/2017/08/18/500072/bannon-says.htm).
Editorially, The China Post mostly aligns with the left as evidenced by these op-eds:
[Opinion | Can BLM movement help Taiwan tackle racism?](https://chinapost.nownews.com/20200706-1483685) and [Taiwan’s sex ed curriculum is lacking. Here’s why](https://chinapost.nownews.com/20200708-1487455). In general, story selection and op-eds favor the left, while the news is mostly factual due to a lack of transparency.
