Analysis / Bias
Logically offers a browser extension, mobile apps and publishes fact checks on the website. The fact checks use a combination of their proprietary AI and human interface. Logically performs fact-checks by scanning the internet for credible media sources who either supports or refutes the claim. For example, in this fact check,
[Gun manufacturers are exempt from being sued in the U.S.](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/7d88530a) the AI scanned and found three sources that confirm the claims are false, [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and Gifford’s Law Center. In reviewing numerous fact checks, they all appear to be credible and accurate. However, human only fact-checking is more rigorous.
The browser extension, on the other hand, is a different story. When you view a news story, you can click the extension icon to get information about the news story. The extension will estimate the source’s credibility and reliability and the tone of the wording. It will provide links to related stories, a good indicator of validity if other sources are reporting the same. It also offers a search for fact checks on the claim. This is all good. However, we found that if it does not recognize a source, and it has words such as “killed” in it, it rates it as negative. The word killed in a news story is not necessarily negative. The context is important. Further, they also label lesser known sources as “Toxicity”. We are unable to dertime why. We do not recommend the extension, but their fact checks are reasonable.
Editorially, they produce commentary on conspiracy theories and misinformation such as this
[. We found editorials written with minimal bias and proper sourcing. All in all, Logically does what it says and delivers the information with low bias.](https://www.logically.ai/articles/hegelian-dialectic-conspiracy-theory)
