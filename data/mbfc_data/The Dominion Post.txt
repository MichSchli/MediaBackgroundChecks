[Bidenâ€™s Homeland Security pick can bring improvement](https://www.dominionpost.com/2020/11/25/bidens-homeland-security-pick-can-bring-improvement/). Some national political stories are also republished through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Although ownership is affiliated with the Republican Party, The Dominion Post often holds left-leaning editorial positions and reports news factually.
