Analysis / Bias
This review will only focus on the espn.com website. ESPN reports sports news with moderately loaded language, such as this
[Mike Brosseau plays hero for Tampa Bay Rays against rival New York Yankees](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30081437/mike-brosseau-plays-hero-tampa-bay-rays-rival-new-york-yankees). In this case, emotive language is used to describe the outcome of a sporting event and is not related to politics. Most stories on the website are straightforward and focus primarily on sports. Further, the website does not have an opinion section though writers often form opinions on players, teams, or sporting organizations’ ownership and coaching. Again, all within the context of sports and not politics.
Although ESPN’s focus sticks to sports, they do cover politics related to sports. A general search of opinions shows that more opinions favor the left with frequent indirect criticism of the former Trump administration, such as this
[Domonique Foxworth outlines why he believes that LeBron James should continue to comment on President Trump whether or not he is asked](https://www.espn.com/search/_/q/trump). Story selection related to politics is also negative towards the former administration, such as this [Rutgers president casts President Trump comments as ‘cheap politics](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29855356/rutgers-president-casts-president-trump-remarks-big-ten-play-cheap-politics).’ In general, ESPN minimally reports on politics; however, it typically moderately favors the left when they do.
