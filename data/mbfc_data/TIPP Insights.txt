Analysis / Bias
Tippinsights.com is a website that publishes news and commentary with a conservative bias. For example, in the article titled:
[‘Rise Of The Effete Authoritarians’,](https://tippinsights.com/rise-of-the-effete-authoritarians/) TIPP Insights republishes a story from the right-leaning [Mises Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/); a quote from the article reads, “political transgressions, while radical leftist agitators and drug-addled street criminals who terrorize cities are quickly forgiven and, in some cases, characterized as victims of an unjust, bigoted society. Some call this situation anarcho-tyranny.” The article is also critical of Trudeau’s government; a quote from the article reads, “Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has activated his authoritarianism whenever he has deemed it necessary” Regarding sourcing, TIPP Insights utilizes the factually mixed [Chronicles Magazine (Rockford)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/chronicles-magazine-rockford/) and credible [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/).
The editorial,
[“Debt Deal Gives Biden A Blank Check, A Huge Loss For Americans,”](https://tippinsights.com/debt-deal-gives-biden-a-blank-check-a-huge-loss-for-americans/) reflects a right-leaning perspective, criticizing Speaker McCarthy and President Biden regarding the debt deal they brokered. It portrays the unlimited borrowing provision as a significant loss for the American people stating, “Speaker McCarthy caved to President Biden by agreeing to unconditionally raise the debt ceiling to whatever amount the Treasury needs.” The overall tone and focus of the article align with conservative viewpoints and highlight skepticism towards the actions of the Democratic leaders involved. The article supports its claims using sources such as [Constitution Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/constitution-daily/) and Congress.gov.
Scientifically, there is evidence they publish authors aligned with
[climate change denial activist group CFACT](https://tippinsights.com/the-self-destruction-of-america-from-within/), which [MBFC rates Low for factual reporting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/committee-constructive-tomorrow-cfact-org/) based on failed fact checks and the promotion of pseudoscience. While TIPP Insights has a good track record as a pollster, their website holds a conservative-libertarian bias and sometimes relies on poor sources.
