Editorially, they provide a balance in story selection, with some favoring the left, such as this
[Donald Trump’s Worst Nightmare](https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2020/october/rebecca-acuna-joe-biden-campaign-donald-trump/). Op-eds tend to slightly favor the left, such as this [DMN Editorial Board Twists Itself in Knots Over Masks in Schools.](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/08/dmn-editorial-board-twists-itself-in-knots-over-masks-in-schools/) A quote from this piece reads, “We applaud him for doing everything in his power to keep our kids and community safe.
