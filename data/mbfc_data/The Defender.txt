Analysis / Bias
In review, Children’s Health Defense primarily publishes news and information skeptical of vaccines and their safety. The website also features a research section that typically does not align with scientific consensus regarding
[vaccines](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/) and other scientific matters. For example, they routinely publish information claiming the dangers of accumulated [Mercury and Thimersol](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), such as this [Generation Zero: Thomas Verstraeten’s First Analyses of the Link Between Vaccine Mercury Exposure and the Risk of Diagnosis of Selected Neuro-Developmental Disorders](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/government/foia/generation-zero-thomas-verstraetens-first-analyses-link-vaccine-mercury-exposure-risk-diagnosis-selected-neuro-developmental-disorders/). According to the [Centers for Disease Control,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) [“Reputable scientific studies have shown that mercury in vaccines given to young children is not a cause of autism.”](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-thimerosal-color-office.pdf)
The Defender covers news related to Covid-19, Big Pharma, Big Energy, Big Food, Big Tech, and Big Chemical. The website often promotes unproven or false claims like this:
[The More COVID Shots You Get, the More Likely You’ll Get COVID. Here’s Why.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-booster-lowered-immunity-infections-cola/) This report is rated as [No Evidence](https://thedispatch.com/article/fact-check-do-booster-shots-increase-a-persons-likelihood-of-getting-covid/) by IFCN fact-checker [The Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-dispatch/).
Besides promoting anti-vaccination propaganda, the Children’s Health Defense/The Defender has also promoted the debunked conspiracy that
[fluoride lowers the IQ in children](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-childrens-health-defense-team-fluoridation-must-end-300776382.html). At this time, there is [not enough evidence](https://theconversation.com/does-water-fluoridation-really-damage-your-childrens-iq-123306) to make that claim. Other conspiracies and/or pseudoscience promoted on this website include the [dangers of 5G](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/what-you-should-know-about-5g-satellites-how-musks-sci-fi-dreams-are-becoming-our-living-nightmare/). During the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), the group accused the United States government of supporting research on a vaccine as part of a plan to [increase revenues for the pharmaceutical industry](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/how-the-anti-vaccine-community-is-responding-to-covid-19/). Further, as seen below, they routinely promote false and misleading claims regarding Covid-19 and vaccines.
