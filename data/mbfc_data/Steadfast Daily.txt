Analysis / Bias
Steadfast Daily does not perform original news reporting. A typical story takes a quote from another story and then summarizes and adds opinions around the quotes. For example, in the story,
[CDC Makes SHOCKING Decision on Masks for the Vaccinated](https://steadfastdaily.com/cdc-makes-shocking-decision-on-masks-for-the-vaccinated/), the author provides a direct quote from the CDC and explains their opinion of the story. In this case, the author is straightforward in reporting, which does not support the sensationalized headline. Most headlines are highly emotional such as this [Joe Biden WUSSES OUT! Says He Shouldn’t Have to Do THIS Anymore!](https://steadfastdaily.com/joe-biden-wusses-out-says-he-shouldnt-have-to-do-this-anymore/)
Editorially most stories favor the right through story selection and often promote former President Trump, such as this
[Trump Reinstatement Date Set, According to Mike Lindell](https://steadfastdaily.com/trump-reinstatement-date-set-according-to-mike-lindell/). The source for this story is Pro-Trump conspiracy theorist [Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lindell-tv/). However, to Steadfast Daily’s credit, they concluded the article with factual information “There is currently no legal or legislative mechanism by which a former President can be reinstated to the White House, which has many constitutional scholars scratching their heads at the idea.” Finally, they also reported on [election fraud](https://steadfastdaily.com/?s=election+fraud) from a factual viewpoint during and after the 2020 election.
Steadfast Daily is right-biased based on story selection, but sourcing and information are usually factual. Unfortunately, the complete lack of transparency lowers their credibility and renders them Mixed for factual reporting based on our criteria. They have also promoted conspiracy theories related to the 2020 Presidential Election.
