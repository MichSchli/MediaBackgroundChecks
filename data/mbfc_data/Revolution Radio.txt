Analysis / Bias
In review, Revolution Radio also has a very strong right-wing bias through story selection that
[favors the right](http://revolutionradio.org/2017/12/19/nyt-clings-to-hope-leftist-resistance-will-bring-down-trump/) and denigrates the left. The topics covered range from [The New World](http://revolutionradio.org/2017/12/19/according-to-the-father-of-propaganda-an-invisible-government-controls-our-minds-with-a-thought-prison/), [911 false flags](http://revolutionradio.org/2017/09/11/we-need-to-admit-the-government-story-about-911-is-bullshit/), [Planet X](http://revolutionradio.org/2017/03/19/planet-x-to-trigger-apocalypse-this-year-and-the-elite-know-say-conspiracy-theorists/), [Geoengineering](http://revolutionradio.org/2017/11/29/climate-engineering-is-planetary-omnicide-dane-wigington/), and a host of other tin foil hat conspiracies. Revolution Radio also promotes pseudoscience such as being [opposed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) to [vaccines](http://revolutionradio.org/2017/12/12/u-s-now-leads-the-industrialized-world-in-infant-mortality-due-to-toxic-vaccinations/). Revolution Radio also uses very questionable sources such as [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and many other sites listed on our Conspiracy-Pseudoscience list.
