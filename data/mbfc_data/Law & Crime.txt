Funded by / Ownership
Law & Crime is owned by the
[Abrams Media Network](https://www.themarysue.com/dan-abrams/), which also owns the left-leaning [Mediaite](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mediaite/) and [The Mary Sue](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-mary-sue/). In 2017, [A+E Network](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-e-networks-takes-stake-in-dan-abramss-live-trial-website-1510602938) invested in Law & Crime and will provide trial coverage for its video streams. The website generates revenue through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features links to watch live streams of ongoing court cases as well as a link that directs you to all the places you can watch, such as Pluto TV. The Law & Crime website also publishes news about court cases with occasionally sensational wording, such as this:
[‘Hollywood Ripper’ Michael Gargiulo Found Guilty of Horrific Murders](https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/michael-gargiulo/hollywood-ripper-michael-gargiulo-found-guilty-of-horrific-murders/). They also report news related to law such as this: [AOC Using Similar Argument to Trump to Insist She Can Block People on Twitter](https://lawandcrime.com/politics/aoc-using-similar-argument-to-trump-to-insist-she-can-block-people-on-twitter/). This story, like most, is properly sourced to credible media outlets.
Editorially, Law & Crime frequently reports negatively on the former Trump administration:
[Sorry, Trump: New York’s ‘Red Flag’ Law Doesn’t Let You Take Chris Cuomo’s Guns](https://lawandcrime.com/opinion/sorry-trump-new-yorks-red-flag-law-doesnt-let-you-take-chris-cuomos-guns/). The clearly labeled opinion piece is properly sourced to Cornell Law. In general, the news is factual and minimally biased; however, editorially, there is moderate left-leaning bias.
