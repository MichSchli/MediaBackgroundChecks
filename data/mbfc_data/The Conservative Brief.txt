Analysis / Bias
In review, the Conservative Brief primarily publishes summaries of news stories, some of which in the past appeared to be plagiarized. For example, this story
[Islamic Czech Thought-leader Calls on Muslims to Arm Themselves, ‘Especially Men](https://www.theconservativebrief.com/islamic-czech-thought-leader-calls-on-muslims-to-arm-themselves-especially-men/),’ changes the headline and [barely reassembles](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/03/23/prague-imam-tells-worshippers-arm-themselves/) an article from the questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). In another story, there is the use of strong emotional language such as this: Breaking: [New Jersey Poised to Become Eight (spelling error in headline) State to Legalize This Horrible Practice](https://www.theconservativebrief.com/breaking-new-jersey-poised-to-become-eight-state-to-legalize-this-horrible-practice/), which is sourced to the questionable and mixed factual [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/). In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left. This is a propaganda source that promotes right-wing positions.
