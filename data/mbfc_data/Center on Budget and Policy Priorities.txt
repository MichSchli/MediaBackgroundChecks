Analysis / Bias
The CBPP publishes news and research on budgets and finance by the United States Government. While carrying an inherent left bias, the articles on the site are highly factual, well-sourced, and carry a minimum of biased wording. CBPP states that they are nonpartisan and carry through on that in their reporting. However, the inherent left bias in their goals and the economic policies they advocate for earns them a left-center rating. The information is factual and well-sourced.
