Funded by / Ownership
The Grit Daily Media Group owns and publishes Smartech Daily. Funding primarily comes from subscribers, advertisements, and sponsorships of their live events.
Analysis / Bias
Smartech Daily publishes news and information related to the SmartTech industry. Articles and headlines are minimally biased in word choices, such as
[The Modern Back and Osaki Unleash the Many Benefits of Massage Chairs](https://smartechdaily.com/the-modern-back-and-osaki-massage-chairs/). Although not labeled promotional, it primarily emphasizes the product’s benefits and lacks critical balance.
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they do report on political issues related to the industry, like
[Breakthroughs in Renewable Solutions](https://smartechdaily.com/breakthroughs-in-renewable-solutions/). In reviewing dozens, a slight majority of politically related pieces lean slightly left in favoring a liberal perspective. In general, they are fact-based, but the content sometimes blurs the lines by not indicating which stories are promotional.
