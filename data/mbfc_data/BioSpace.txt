Analysis / Bias
The website primarily focuses on industry-related news covering mergers, the pharmaceutical industry, and reports on clinical trials. Articles and headlines use moderately loaded language such as this
[Four Biotechs Rake in Over $350 Million for Rare Diseases, Cancers and More](https://www.biospace.com/article/forge-biologics-raises-120-million-in-series-b-and-other-financing-news/). When it comes to sourcing information, they use credible sources such as Business Wire and PR Newswire.
They also publish advances in research and development such as this
[Eagle Pharmaceuticals Announces TREAKISYM (bendamustine) Ready-to-Dilute (“RTD”) Formulation](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/eagle-pharmaceuticals-announces-treakisym-bendamustine-ready-to-dilute-rtd-formulation-/). In general, Biospace promotes pro-science news with minimal political bias, though they tend to favor the pharmaceutical industry. We rate them Mostly Factual due to a failed fact check.
