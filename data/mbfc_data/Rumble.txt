[right-wing pundits](https://www.newsweek.com/what-rumble-youtube-alternative-where-conservative-views-wont-discriminated-against-1542141) joined the service leading to incredible growth by right-biased and pro-Trump supporters. [According](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/dan-bongino-rumble) to Chris Pavlovski, Rumble is a “clean YouTube competitor, the place they can feel safe.” Finally, in 2020, Conservative Pundit [Dan Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bongino-com/) bought an equity stake in the company.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Rumble is a video upload and streaming service that feature a wide range of videos. However, throughout 2020, the video service began featuring more and more right-biased content. Some of their featured video channels include author Dinesh D’Souza,
[Charlie Kirk](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/turning-point-usa/), [OANN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/), [Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hannity-com/), [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/), and of course, [Dan Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bongino-com/). While many of the videos featured are non-political such as cute animal videos, most news videos are far-right biased and some from conspiracy sources such as [X22 Reports](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/x22-report/) and Steve Bannon’s War Room.
During 2020, they have promoted false and misleading information regarding Covid-19, such as

According to science and experts in the field, a mask is essential to [slow the spread](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) of Covid-19. Further, during the 2020 Presidential election, they frequently published [false videos](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/10/pamela-geller/debunking-hammer-and-scorecard-election-fraud-cons/) claiming election fraud such as this [HAMMER software fraud in real-time](https://rumble.com/vayudc-hammer-software-fraud-in-real-time.html). Finally, they also promote conspiracy theories from [QAnon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/qanon-pub/) such as this [Plandemic COVID SCAM – Fall Of Cabal Deep State And Illuminati Globalist Agenda 21 ID2020](https://rumble.com/). In general, the videos published on Rumble are mostly right-biased, and many are not factual or promote conspiracy theories.
