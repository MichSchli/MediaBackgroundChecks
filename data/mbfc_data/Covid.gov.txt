History
Launched in March 2022, Covid.gov is a website from the Department of Health & Human Services that provides information and guidance on Covid-19 safety. According to the HHS
[website](https://www.hhs.gov/about/index.html), “The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Covid.gov provides information on why masks effectively reduce the transmission of Covid-19 and how to get masks. This information links to the
[CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) website. Next, the website offers a link to treatment options and “test to treat” locations. Again, this links to the CDC. The website also links vaccine information from [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/), which allows a person to search and find vaccination facilities in their location. Finally, Covid.gov provides a link on how to order at-home test kits.
The website also provides “Other Resources” that link to the CDC, covering: Symptoms and Care, At Home Testing, and information on Travel. In general, the information is fact-based and rooted in the latest scientific consensus.
