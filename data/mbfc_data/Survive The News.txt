History
Survive The News is an anonymously published conservative news and opinion website. The website lacks an about page and does not disclose ownership. However,
[on the sidebar](https://www.survivethenews.com/contact/), they disclaim: “NOTICE: This site is purely a religious organization; anything that seems like political or health-based discussion is simply our religious doctrine and beliefs.” It is not clear what religion they practice.
On the same sidebar, they appear proud of being banned on many social media outlets:
We’ve been banned from:
Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Medium, WordPress, Google, Gmail (literally), Blogspot, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, PayPal, LiveJournal, Soundcloud, Dailymotion, Vimeo, Tumblr, Flickr & Youtube… and probably several others I forgot about.
The website does not disclose its location, but the

Funded by / Ownership
Survive The News completely lacks transparency as it does not disclose ownership or the names of people associated with the website. Advertising appears to be the primary generator of income; they also sell products and have Amazon links.
Analysis / Bias
The articles on “Survive the News” in the politics category demonstrate a strong conservative bias, primarily featuring content critical of the Biden administration and supportive of former President Trump. The topics and presentation suggest a focus on issues and narratives popular within conservative circles, often sourced from other conservative outlets like
[The Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which has a poor track record with fact checkers.
Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional language like this
[Deepfake Scammers Stage Bogus Conference Videocall and Steal $25 Million From Multinational Company in Hong Kong](https://www.survivethenews.com/deepfake-scammers-stage-bogus-conference-videocall-and-steal-25-million-from-multinational-company-in-hong-kong-the-gateway-pundit/). This story originated from the Very Low Factual Gateway Pundit.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and frequently denigrate the left like this
[Biden Team Concerned Robert Hur’s Report Will Include ‘Embarrassing’ Photos of Stolen Classified Documents Stored in Biden Delaware Garage – NO CHARGES EXPECTED](https://www.survivethenews.com/biden-team-concerned-robert-hurs-report-will-include-embarrassing-photos-of-stolen-classified-documents-stored-in-biden-delaware-garage-no-charges-expected-the-gateway-pundit/). Again, most stories reviewed are republished from the Gateway Pundit.
Finally, they also make ridiculous claims like this “
[EVIDENCE THAT COVID19 is REALLY SNAKE VENOM IN OUR WATER SUPPLY.](https://www.survivethenews.com/x22-report-and-we-know-mike-adams-scott-mckay-dr-ardis-exposing-the-serpent-of-cv-19-project-looking-glass/)” This false fear-mongering leads to links to Amazon products that supposedly neutralize the vaccine. This tactic attempts to dupe gullible people into buying a product that is not necessary and has no scientific basis. In general, most information on the website is far-right biased and promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
