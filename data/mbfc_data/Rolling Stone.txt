Analysis / Bias
Rolling Stone is a monthly magazine and website that covers music, pop culture, and politics. Over the last 50+ years, Rolling Stone has produced long-form well-researched journalism on a wide variety of topics, especially as it relates to politics. When it comes to political news, Rolling Stone does not shy from using loaded emotional wording that conveys a left-leaning bias such as this:
[Trump Is Awfully Sensitive About His Confusing Immigration Deal With Mexico](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-immigration-deal-mexico-tariffs-846165/). This story is properly sourced to a video of Trump as well as the credible [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). Another example of strongly emotional wording is the [ Trump Administration Is Cooking Stats to Keep the Sick Sick and the Poor Poor](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/welfare-trump-administration-poverty-841006/).
Editorially, Rolling Stone almost always favors the left. In 2016, they
[endorsed](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/hillary-clinton-for-president-118261/) Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) has described Rolling Stone as a “ [Liberal Cheerleader.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/18/rolling-stone-magazine-up-for-sale)” In general, Rolling Stone reports news factually and with proper sourcing; however, their opinion pieces are consistently left-biased.
