They also run the site as part of a network of over [100 news portals](http://www.midwestradionetwork.com/enewspapers.html).

Analysis / Bias
The North Korea Times utilizes minimally loaded language both in their headlines and articles such as
[“Did Trump cancel North Korea summit to avoid embarrassment?”](http://www.northkoreatimes.com/news/257349923/did-trump-cancel-north-korea-summit-to-avoid-embarrassment) and [“’White House waging fierce campaign against Mueller’s probe.’”](http://www.northkoreatimes.com/category/b8de8e630faf3631) However, they source poorly through quoting rather than providing any links to back their claims. The North Korea Times also republishes full articles from [Voice of America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/voice-of-america/), [Asian News International](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/asian-news-international-ani/), and other mostly least biased sources.
The North Korea Times is not a North Korean news source. They report news about North Korea that comes from mostly least biased international sources.
