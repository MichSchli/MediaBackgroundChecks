As a philanthropist, Sandler has donated approximately

Bias
In review, ProPublica is criticized by right-leaning news sources such as the
[Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2016/10/31/daily-source-bias-check-washington-examiner/) for favoring the left in their investigative journalism: [ProPublica is the left’s biggest muckraker you never heard of](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/propublica-is-the-lefts-biggest-muckraker-you-never-heard-of). However, ProPublica defends its journalism and integrity with this response: [“We stick with the facts, and several editors read every story](https://www.propublica.org/article/ask-ppil-on-bias-in-journalism).” In general, their investigations look at corruption and abuses of power. While ProPublica purports to be non-partisan, a review of their recent reports is aimed at [right-leaning politicians](https://www.propublica.org/article/devos-has-scuttled-more-than-1-200-civil-rights-probes-inherited-from-obama) and their [issues](https://www.propublica.org/series/zero-tolerance).
Another example of left-leaning bias can be found in the
[article](https://www.propublica.org/article/senator-demands-answers-from-case-farms) titled “Senator Demands Answers From Case Farms,” which contains a note at the end of the article that reads, “Do you have information about how immigrant workers are being treated in the age of Trump?” Mentioning Trump is conveying a negative bias towards Trump’s right-leaning immigration policies.
ProPublica publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[“The Shadow Rulers of the VA.”](https://www.propublica.org/article/ike-perlmutter-bruce-moskowitz-marc-sherman-shadow-rulers-of-the-va) When it comes to sourcing, they typically utilize source documents via documentcloud.org. They also use credible left-leaning sources such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Hollywood Reporter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hollywood-reporter/), and The [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/).
