Analysis / Bias
In review, Medical Medium publishes news on alternative health and nutrition. Anthony William does not hold any medical degrees; however, he claims his information comes from the “Spirit of Compassion.” This spirit has misinformed him numerous times, such as advising him that Celery Juice is a miracle food that can cure numerous ailments. For example, he claims that celery juice can help chronic fatigue syndrome
[How Celery Juice Helps Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://www.medicalmedium.com/blog/how-celery-juice-helps-chronic-fatigue-syndrome). In fact, Anthony William claims [without evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/style/self-care/celery-juice-benefits.html) that celery juice will cure most medical problems.
Medical Medium also
[promotes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-detoxification/) that [Celery Juice will detox the body](https://www.medicalmedium.com/blog/medical-medium-heavy-metal-detox) from heavy metals such as mercury, which they falsely claim causes [autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/): [Study: No Link Between Mercury Exposure and Autism-like Behaviors](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/3893/study-no-link-between-mercury-exposure-and-autism-like-behaviors.aspx). In general, this is a quackery-level pseudoscience website that frequently makes false or misleading claims regarding health.
