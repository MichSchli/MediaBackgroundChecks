Analysis / Bias
In review, Washingtonian Magazine is published monthly; however, the website is updated daily. Journalists cover topics in the DC area that consists of entertainment, culture, general news, and politics. News reporting tends to favor the left through story selection and wording such as this:
[Far-Right Activists Brought Their Gripes About Social Media to a Park Near the White House This Weekend](https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/07/08/far-right-activists-brought-their-gripes-about-social-media-to-a-park-near-the-white-house-this-weekend/). This story is properly sourced from credible left-leaning sources such as The [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) and [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/).
The Washingtonian also produces long-form journalism that is thoroughly researched, such as this:
[A Murder on the Rappahannock River](https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/06/27/murder-on-the-rappahannock-river-emerson-stevens-mary-harding-innocence-project/). The website also provides rankings that include top physicians, top places to dine, and top neighborhoods. Editorially, almost all opinions favor the left and denigrate the right such as this: [We Should All Cringe With Embarrassment About Trump’s Banana-Republic July 4 Spectacle](https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/07/02/we-should-all-cringe-with-embarrassment-about-trumps-banana-republic-july-4-spectacle/).
