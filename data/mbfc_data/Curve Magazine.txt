Analysis / Bias
In review, Curve Magazine has a liberal bias in story selection that mostly favors the left. They also have a negative opinion of conservatives, specifically
[Donald Trump](http://www.curvemag.com/News/Trumps-Presidency-Is-Very-Bad-For-LGBT-People-1836/). Curve Magazine uses minimal to [moderate emotional language](http://www.curvemag.com/News/Trump-Hates-Fat-Ugly-Slobs-Dogs-Lesbian-Women-1503/), and all articles are well sourced to credible, mostly left-leaning media such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/). There also isn’t evidence of Curve Magazine failing fact checks.
