Analysis / Bias
SWI delivers news from politics and business to sports, lifestyle, special reports, and entertainment. SWI reports national news with minimally loaded words: “
[Swiss vocational training serves as a model for others](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/from-singapore-to-switzerland_vpet-18--swiss-vocational-training-as-a-model-for-others/44123310?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=own-posts&utm_medium=socialflow&utm_content=o)” and [“Pollsters wager voters will approve gambling law.”](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/vote-june-10--2018_pollsters-wager-voters-will-approve-gambling-law/44150716) Swissinfo frequently uses credible government and media sources such as ednc.org, vpet-congress.ch, ncee.org, channelnewsasia.com, The Pan African News Agency, World Bank, and [Fortune Magazine.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fortune-magazine/) Further, under the category business, SWI [republishes](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bloomberg) articles from [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and under the category politics, they [republish](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/reuters) articles from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, opinion pieces tend to slightly favor the left, such as this
[Adopt green hydrogen strategy now, Swiss cantons tell Bern](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/adopt-green-hydrogen-strategy-now--swiss-cantons-tell-bern/48652128). In general, SWI is fact-based and hold slight left-leaning editorial biases.
