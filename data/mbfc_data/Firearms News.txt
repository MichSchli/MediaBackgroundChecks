Analysis / Bias
In review, Firearms News mostly reports on different types of guns and their capabilities, such as this:
[Ruger Announces 3 Guns in .350 Legend](https://www.firearmsnews.com/editorial/ruger-announces-3-guns-in-350-legend/360118). They also break down news into two other categories, Industry and the 2nd Amendment.
Under the Industry tag, they report news about manufacturers like this:
[Speer Introduces New Look, Logo and Online Sales](https://www.firearmsnews.com/editorial/speer-introduces-new-look-logo-and-online-sales/331465).
Under the 2nd Amendment tag, you find political news that leans right and uses moderately loaded wording like this:
[How the Gun-Grabbers Grabbed Nevada](https://www.firearmsnews.com/editorial/how-the-gun-grabbers-grabbed-nevada/360294). This article is appropriately labeled an opinion piece; however, the author utilizes questionable sources such as [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) and [FrontPage Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontpage-magazine/) to support his claims. In another opinion piece, there is again use of strongly loaded emotional language that denigrates the left, [DEMOCRATâ€™S ANTI-GUN / ANTI-CIVIL LIBERTIES INFRINGEMENT CAMPAIGN UNDERWAY AGAIN](https://www.firearmsnews.com/editorial/democrats-anti-gun-anti-civil-liberties-infringement-campaign-underway-again/331067). Although this article is highly right biased, the author does source information properly. In general, when reporting straight news about firearms, this is a low-biased source; however, editorially, this is a strongly right-biased source that routinely reports negatively on Democrats and the left in general.
