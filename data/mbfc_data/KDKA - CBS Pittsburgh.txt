Analysis / Bias
In review, the CBS Pittsburgh website publishes sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and local news for the greater Pittsburgh region. Local news articles and headlines use minimal emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[Two Local School Districts Allowing Fans To Attend Football Games.](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/09/18/fans-allowed-at-high-school-sporting-events/) A video accompanies most stories from the TV station. National news stories are published by other [CBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) affiliates and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, CBS Pittsburgh does not publish op-eds; however, they report on politics slightly favoring the left, such as this
[Gov. Tom Wolf Urges Lawmakers To Pass Paid Sick Leave Legislation.](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/08/31/pennsylvania-governor-tom-wolf-paid-sick-leave-legislation/) Most importantly, the reporters deliver political news with little opinion interjected. In general, CBS Pittsburgh reports news factually and with a slight left-leaning bias in story selection.
