The TN Holler website publishes news and commentary for the state of Tennessee focused on topics such as Jobs & Economy, Immigration, Health Care, Guns, and Education. Articles and headlines sometimes use emotionally loaded language that favors the left, such as this
[CONFESSIONS OF A CONVERTED SCHOOLS PRIVATIZATION LOBBYIST](https://tnholler.com/2022/08/confessions-of-a-converted-schools-privatization-lobbyist/). A review of several articles indicates they utilize credible sources such as government agencies and local media outlets like the [Columbia Daily Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-daily-herald/).
Editorially, all stories favor the progressive left, such as this promoting criticism of the SCOTUS decision to overturn Roe v. Wade
