Analysis / Bias
In review, the Knoxville News Sentinel utilizes local reporters for local news stories and republishes content from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and USA Today for national news. In actual news stories, there is little use of loaded language; however, editorial pieces utilize emotional wording such as this: [Hypocritical politically motivated feminism is killing #MeToo. Just ask Keith Ellison.](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/2018/08/21/feminism-metoo-hypocrisy-sexual-harassment-keith-ellison-avital-ronell-column/1042010002/)
In 2008, the Knoxville News Sentinel
[stopped endorsing](http://www.ledgertn.com/editorial/ArticleEmail.aspx?id=62069&print=1) Presidential candidates after a long history of selecting Republicans. They still endorse local politicians with slight favoritism to Republican candidates.
