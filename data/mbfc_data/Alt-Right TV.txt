History
Founded in 2016 by the
[Knights Party (KKK)](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/knights-ku-klux-klan), Alt-Right TV is a website that promotes the Ku Klux Klan and publishes content in support of White and Christian Identity. In other words, it is a virulently racist website. According to their about page “Alt-Right TV brings current news of interest to white men, women, and families.”
The Knights of the KKK was founded by David Duke in 1975 and is currently headed by
[Thomas Robb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robb_(activist)) who is an ardent supporter of former President Trump. [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
When reviewing hate groups we will not provide hyperlinks to their website. We do this to protect ourselves as Google will pick up on these links and think that we are endorsing them. Google’s Search Algorithm is the worst, unfortunately, it is also the most popular.
In review, the Alt-Right TV website publishes news stories in support of White Nationalism. Most articles are republished from other sources such as the
[New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2020/10/28/daily-source-bias-check-post-journal-jamestown-new-york/) and the [Daily Caller.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) The website also provides links to White Pride Radio and a section called White Resistance News. They frequently promote racist conspiracy theories such as White Genocide, Muslim Invasions, and the Deep State. Further, this source routinely promotes Donald Trump and conservatives who are opposed to immigration.
We don’t think it is necessary to provide details on how and why the KKK is a
[hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/knights-ku-klux-klan). In general, this is a source that is low in factual content and high in extremely right biased hate.
