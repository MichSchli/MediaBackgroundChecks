Analysis / Bias
Syria News uses extremely loaded language to convey emotion against the opposition and often only presents one side of the story, such as this
[Russian Foreign Ministry: US CENTCOM Commander McKenzie is Lying](https://syrianews.cc/russian-foreign-ministry-us-centcom-commander-mckenzie-is-lying/). This story, like most, relies on the use of self-linking. Self-linking is when you link to other pages on your own website rather than outside credible sources.
Editorially, they strongly support the Syrian state and President Bashar Al-Asaad through stories such as this
[Russian Forces Patrol Rams into US Oil Thieves Army in Northern Syria](https://syrianews.cc/russian-forces-patrol-rams-into-us-oil-thieves-army-in-northern-syria/) and this [President Assad and First Lady Asmaa Vote in the Liberated City of Douma](https://syrianews.cc/president-assad-and-first-lady-asmaa-vote-in-the-liberated-city-of-douma/). Through the support of Al-Asaad, they also support the left-wing [Arab Socialist Baâ€™ath Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Socialist_Ba%27ath_Party_%E2%80%93_Syria_Region). In general, Syria News promotes one-sided pro-Syrian state news best described as propaganda.
