Analysis / Bias
Truth Based Media does not produce original content but rather curates conservative news and opinion from other sources. Typically, they republish a summary or full articles from these sources. A review indicates they do not change the emotionally loaded headlines such as this
[Globalist Agenda: Wars, Famine, and Digitization to Pave Way for Great Reset](https://truthbasedmedia.com/2022/07/09/globalist-agenda-wars-famine-and-digitization-to-pave-way-for-great-reset/). This story comes from the discredited [Natural News](https://truthbasedmedia.com/2022/07/09/globalist-agenda-wars-famine-and-digitization-to-pave-way-for-great-reset/) website, which consistently publishes false and misleading information.
Almost all of the sources they choose to republish are on our
[conspiracy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/) or [questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) lists, such as [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/), [American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). Editorially, all stories favor the right and frequently promote right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories such as the Great Reset, [What Is the “Great Reset,” and What Do the Globalists Actually Want?](https://truthbasedmedia.com/2022/04/01/what-is-the-great-reset-and-what-do-the-globalists-actually-want/) In general, they hold a far-right bias editorially, with almost every story being either misleading or false.
Failed Fact Checks
- Truth Based Media does not produce original content; however, the sources they publish, such as the
[Gateway Pundit](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=gateway%20pundit), fail fact checks daily.
