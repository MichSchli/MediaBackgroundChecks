Analysis / Bias
The Geopolitical Economy Report’s content demonstrates a clear editorial perspective, particularly in negatively portraying Western nations and their foreign policies. The outlet often presents a critical view of the United States and its allies, emphasizing perceived contradictions and failures in upholding democratic values and human rights. For example, one article titled
[“West votes against democracy, human rights, cultural diversity at U.N.; promotes mercenaries, sanctions”](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2023/11/26/west-vote-democracy-human-rights-un-sanctions/) focuses on criticizing Western nations, particularly the United States and its allies, for their voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly on resolutions related to democracy, human rights, and cultural diversity, as well as their support for mercenaries and sanctions.
The article argues that these actions demonstrate a hypocrisy in Western commitments to human rights and democracy. The Geopolitical Economy Report cites the
[U.N. Press Release GASHC4398](https://press.un.org/en/2023/gashc4398.doc.htm) as its source, validating its reference to U.N. resolutions on key issues such as mercenaries and unilateral coercive measures approved by the Third Committee.
In the article
[“China deepens ties with Venezuela, challenging U.S.’ Hegemonic Mindset,'”](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2023/09/15/china-venezuela-us-maduro-oil/) the relationship between these two countries is portrayed as challenging Western dominance, highlighting [China’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/) condemnation of U.S. sanctions and support for [Venezuela’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/venezuela-media-profile/) sovereignty.
These examples reflect a tendency in the Geopolitical Economy Report’s reporting to critique Western actions, particularly those of the United States, while portraying countries that oppose Western hegemony in a positive light, indicating an editorial bias that leans towards a critical view of Western geopolitical strategies and a more favorable perspective of certain non-Western states and their actions. The articles reviewed are well-sourced; however, we found examples of the Geopolitical Economy Report drawing conclusions that are not supported by evidence (See Below).
Unsubstantiated Claims / Failed Fact Checks
One example is the article titled
[Pakistan’s Imran Khan compares his ouster to CIA coup in Iran, criticizes Western colonialism](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2022/12/30/pakistan-imran-khan-cia-coup-iran/) in which the author supports Imran Khan’s unproven claim that the CIA and US Government orchestrated a coup to remove him. While Khan’s claim may or may not be true, there is [no evidence to support it](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-pakistan-us-coup-conspiracy/6743342.html), rendering it a conspiracy theory.
In another story,
[Peru coup: CIA agent turned US ambassador met with defense minister day before president overthrown](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2022/12/14/coup-us-ambassador-peru-cia/), suggests that this meeting and the ambassador’s background imply US involvement or support for the coup. However, it does not provide direct evidence linking the US ambassador’s actions to the coup, nor does it offer concrete proof that the meeting was anything more than a routine diplomatic engagement. There are no other credible sources making this claim, although a [nearly identical article](https://www.globalresearch.ca/peru-coup-cia-agent-turned-us-ambassador-met-defense-minister-day-before-president-overthrown/5802701) appeared on the Conspiracy website [Global Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-research/), rendering it a conspiracy theory.
Geopolitical Economy Report has also made several
[misleading or unsubstantiated claims](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2022/03/10/nato-arming-training-nazis-ukraine-azov/) regarding [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/), such as routinely claiming the [pro-Russian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) narrative that [Nazis dominate the Ukrainian government and military](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2022/05/06/operation-gladio-nato-nazis-cia/) and that [Western governments are supporting the Nazis](https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2022/04/03/uk-arming-ukrainian-nazis-azov/).
Although far-right extremists are present in Ukraine, according to
[factcheck.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/factcheck/), their [political influence is minimal](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/the-facts-on-de-nazifying-ukraine/); however, Russian propaganda and Geopolitical Economy Report significantly overstates their impact, falsely depicting these minor groups as a major political force, a claim that misleadingly magnifies a minor issue.
In general, the Geopolitical Economy Report holds Left-Libertarian anti-war and anti-imperialism perspectives. They also sometimes rely on unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and propaganda to advance their agenda.
