Analysis / Bias
In review, The Next Web uses loaded words in their headlines and article such as this
[Spotify’s COVID-19 content warning is bullshit](https://thenextweb.com/news/spotify-covid-19-label-joe-rogan-analysis). Articles are usually sourced from credible media outlets such as [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and [VOX](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/).
Editorially, they tend to favor the left as they report somewhat negatively on the policies of former President
[Donald Trump and the GOP](https://thenextweb.com/latest/?q=Trump). Another example of anti-conservative bias is this [Robots don’t care what Josh Hawley thinks about masculinity](https://thenextweb.com/news/robots-dont-care-what-josh-hawley-thinks-about-masculinity).
