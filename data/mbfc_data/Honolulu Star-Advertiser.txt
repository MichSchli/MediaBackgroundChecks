[ officials offer few details in Pearl Harbor fatal shooting; motive still unknown](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/12/06/breaking-news/military-officials-offer-few-details-in-pearl-harbor-fatal-shooting-motive-still-unknown/).

Editorially, the Star-Advertiser produces reasonably balanced op-eds but leans slightly left overall
[Editorial: Make strict rules for carrying guns](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/07/08/editorial/our-view/editorial-make-strict-rules-for-carrying-guns/). Political news coverage tends to lean left with consistent positive coverage of Democratic Presidential Candidate [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/11/21/hawaii-news/tulsi-gabbards-fiery-exchanges-stand-out-in-good-natured-debate/), a former congresswoman from Hawaii.
