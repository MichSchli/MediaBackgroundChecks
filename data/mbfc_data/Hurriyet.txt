Analysis / Bias
The media in Turkey is currently separated into two groups. Pro-government media is called the
[“pool media,”](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/murat-yetkin/the-new-media-disorder-in-turkey-82654) and the other is called the opposition media. Hurriyet is considered to be in the pool media after it was sold to Demiroren Group, which is closely related to the right-leaning AKP party and President Erdogan.
In review, Hurriyet publishes articles with emotionally loaded language and incorporates sensational headlines from British tabloids such as
[“Kardeş kıskançlığı](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/galeri-kardes-kiskancligi-41512149/4).” Hurriyet’s columnists regularly publish articles that are critical of the opposition, such as [“Babacan siyasetçi mi teknokrat mı?.”](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/abdulkadir-selvi/babacan-siyasetci-mi-teknokrat-mi-41491047) When it comes to national news, Hurriyet publishes in favor of the government [“Bakan Varank Kovid-19’a karşı verilen ‘Yerli’ mücadeleyi anlattı”.](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/bakan-varank-kovid-19a-karsi-verilen-yerli-mucadeleyi-anlatti-41508200)
Hurriyet is often poorly sourced by hyperlinking to themselves or using false hyperlinks on their homepage, such as in this
[article](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/hukumet-bana-is-bul-deme-hakkina-sahibim-41509035) where they hyperlinked the word “haber” that, when clicked, ends up on their home page. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a positive tone, such as in this article [“Trump: Çok tuhaf şeyler oluyor.”](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/son-dakika-haberler-trump-cok-tuhaf-seyler-oluyor-41497673) In general, this is a tabloid-style paper that promotes pro-government propaganda.
