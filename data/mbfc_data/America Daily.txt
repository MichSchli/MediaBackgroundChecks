Analysis / Bias
In review, America Daily publishes podcasts, radio programs, and news with a strong conservative bias. Articles and headlines frequently use loaded emotional wording such as this
[NY Attorney Slams Gov. Cuomo’s Illegal Coronavirus Tyranny](https://americadaily.com/ny-attorney-slams-gov-cuomos-illegal-coronavirus-tyranny-video/). This story is sourced to a video from the factually mixed [The New American](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-new-american/). America Daily often promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy theories such as this article promoting [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) [Danger in Vaccines](https://americadaily.com/danger-in-vaccines/). The website also promotes conspiracies related to [5G](https://americadaily.com/5g-is-it-safe-video/), the [deep state](https://americadaily.com/federal-reserve-exploiting-covid19-to-loot-america-behind-the-deep-state-video/), and [climate change misinformation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).
Editorially, there is a strong right-wing bias through the promotion of the conservative agenda as well as denigration of the left such as this
[A UN Rogues’ Gallery: Socialists, Communists, Terrorists, Globalists Run the Show](https://americadaily.com/a-un-rogues-gallery-socialists-communists-terrorists-globalists-run-the-show/). In general, this is a far-right website that promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
