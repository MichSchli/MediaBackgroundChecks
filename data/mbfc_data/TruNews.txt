Analysis / Bias
In review, TruNews publishes far-right conservative news and opinions that use strongly loaded emotional language such as this

NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS DEPLOYED TO U.S. CITIES FOR ELECTION VIOLENCE](https://www.trunews.com/stream/countdown-to-chaos-national-guard-troops-deployed-to-u-s-cities-for-election-violence). This story is unsourced. A review of numerous stories indicates that all favor the right and frequently denigrate the left, such as this [TRUNEWS PREDICTION: EXPECT PRESIDENT TRUMP VICTORY AND DEMOCRAT VIOLENCE](https://www.trunews.com/stream/trunews-prediction-expect-president-trump-victory-and-democrat-violence).
The website and radio program frequently promote conspiracy theories aimed at Jews, Minorities, LGBTQ, and Immigrants.
[According](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/trunews-and-rick-wiles-end-times-anti-semitism-and-anti-zionism) to the [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/), “TruNews is a fundamentalist Christian streaming news and opinion platform that has increasingly featured anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist content, and also has a long record of disseminating radical Islamophobic and anti-LGBTQ messages.” Further, Rick Wiles has called Trump’s Impeachment a [“Jew Coup.”](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rick-wiles-trump-impeachment/) In general, they are best classified as a hate group.
Regarding science, they minimize the impact of
