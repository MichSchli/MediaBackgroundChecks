History
Bizpac Review (BPR) is a conservative news and opinion website founded by
[Jack Furnarni](https://www.bizpacreview.com/author/jackfurnari) in 2009. According to their [about page,](https://www.bizpacreview.com/about-us) they are a “political news website that provides breaking news and analysis unfiltered by the liberal bias that has eroded the media’s credibility. With public trust in the press sputtering at an all-time low, BizPac Review fills the void with its unparalleled coverage of current events that the mainstream media intentionally ignore.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
[Olympic Media](https://www.olympicmedia.com/) owns and publishes BizPac Review. According to [Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), Olympic Media [receives funding](https://www.opensecrets.org/campaign-expenditures/vendor?year=2022&vendor=Olympic%20Media) from prominent Republican politicians and PACS. For example, in the 2022 election cycle, they received a total of $4,831,681. Notable funders include Jim Jordan for Congress $1,293,441, [Great American Patriot Project](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/great-american-patriot-project/C00767608/expenditures/2022#vendors) $1,102,481, Cawthorn for North Carolina $488,408, and Josh Hawley for Senate $244,084.
The BizPac Review website lacks transparency as they do not disclose these funders. Advertising, donations, and a store that sells conservative branded merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Bizpac Review covers news and opinion content with a strong conservative Republican bias. They also have a people section covering commentary and news about other conservatives such as Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and Laura Ingraham, all of which have poor records with fact-checkers.
Story selection always favors the right and utilizes loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Speaker makes big mistake of addressing crowd as ‘guys’ at Dem Socialists of America convention](https://www.bizpacreview.com/2019/08/05/speaker-makes-big-mistake-of-addressing-crowd-as-guys-at-dem-socialists-of-america-convention-781956). This story is sourced to video followed by biased commentary with loaded wording such as this: “Not that Comrade Jackson didn’t begin by noting his preferred pronouns — but this was AFTER he addressed the room as “guys.” When not reporting negatively on Democrats, they frequently glorify Donald Trump and other conservatives with positive wording: [Trump suggests combo gun and immigration action to make something ‘GREAT, come out of two tragic events](https://www.bizpacreview.com/2019/08/05/trump-suggests-combo-gun-and-immigration-action-to-make-something-great-come-out-of-two-tragic-events-781870). This story is reported with mostly neutral wording using quotes from the President, which differs greatly from their reporting on the left, which offers strong opinions.
Editorially, Bizpac Review almost always favors the right. They also republish content from the factually Mixed
