The San Antonio Current covers local arts, food, culture, music, entertainment, and news for the San Antonio Metro Area. Local news is generally reported via staff writers, with some in-depth pieces. Straight news uses minimally loaded words such as this:
[San Antonio’s Alamodome ranked among world’s ugliest buildings](https://www.sacurrent.com/news/san-antonios-alamodome-ranked-among-worlds-ugliest-buildings-30849103). News stories are generally sourced through quotes, first-hand accounts, or hyperlinks.
Editorially, the San Antonio Current leans strongly left with progressive opinion/news pieces such as these:
