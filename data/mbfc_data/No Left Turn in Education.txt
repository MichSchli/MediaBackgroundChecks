[lists court cases](https://www.noleftturn.us/clark-case/) that have been brought generally trying to stop the teaching of Critical Race Theory in schools. The website also has a section called “Get The Facts,” where they list the things they are opposed to, such as Indoctrination, Critical Race Theory, The 1619 Project, Sexualizing Children, Woke Math and Science, Social Emotional Learning, and Action Civics. Under each heading, they link to articles such as [How ‘Socio-Emotional Learning’ Became Another Vehicle For Anti-White Racism In Schools](https://thefederalist.com/2021/02/08/how-socio-emotional-learning-became-another-vehicle-for-anti-white-racism-in-schools/). This story links to the Questionable, [The Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/), which has a poor track record with fact checkers.
Editorially, the content on No Left Turn in Education holds far-right conservative perspectives such as
[Eugenics and the Racist Underbelly of the American Left](https://mises.org/wire/eugenics-and-racist-underbelly-american-left), which is derived from [Mises](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/). Further, No Left Turn in Education has made [controversial statements](https://www.mediamatters.org/education/no-left-turn-education-leading-anti-critical-race-theory-group-frequently-pushes-toxic) directed at Planned Parenthood via social media, such as this “Take your organ harvesting gender fluidity and pornography nonsense back to Trans-sylvania or wherever the hell you created it, and stay away from our kids!” The statement contains elements that could be interpreted as hateful or discriminatory, particularly in its use of charged language and controversial terms.
Finally, according to the
[National Education Association](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/who-behind-attacks-educators-and-public-schools), in referencing groups like No Left Turn in Education, states:
But many of the advocacy groups working behind the scenes to help orchestrate these protests and limit discussions about race in public schools are supported by a web of dark money and right-wing operatives looking to exploit culture war grievances for political gain. While these groups claim they are defending against “indoctrination,” their real aim is to manufacture divisive misinformation that can be used to stoke unjust fears across the country. By doing so, they hope to silence teachers’ voices and replace school boards with ideologically-driven members, thereby destroying the very fabric of public education from the inside.
In general, No Left Turn in Education is a Far-Right conservative advocacy group that sometimes publishes divisive propaganda that is not factual.
