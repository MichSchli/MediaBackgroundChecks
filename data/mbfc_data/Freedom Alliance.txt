Analysis / Bias
In review, The Freedom Alliance provides support and funds to help wounded personnel as well provides scholarships to children of fallen soldiers. They describe their vision as “A national security strategy which deters wars that are avoidable; wins wars that are inevitable; and never forgets those who go to war on our nation’s behalf.” In other words, Freedom Alliance supports a strong, well funded military, but also wants to help those who have served.
The website site offers a wide variety of ways to support the troops, such as hosting retreats to setting up
[rehab and recovery funds](https://freedomalliance.org/programs/rehab-recovery-fund/). The website also contains a news section that provides press releases regarding the activities of the Freedom Alliance. There is minimal bias in the articles such as this: [COMBAT VETERAN RECEIVES MORTGAGE-FREE HOME](https://freedomalliance.org/support-our-troops-2/live-deserving-marine-veteran-receives-home-from-freedom-alliance-and-u-s-bank/). In general, this is not a news source, but rather an advocacy and charity group.
