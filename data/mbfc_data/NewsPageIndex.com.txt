Analysis / Bias
NewsPageIndex.com primarily republishes David Rufful’s news and opinion stories from the
[Analyzing America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/analyzing-america/) website. The website used to feature two other writers from Savage Reports; however, they have not been published on NewsPageIndex.com since 2021. Therefore, David Rufful is currently the only author.
Articles and headlines utilize loaded emotional wording that favors a conservative perspective, such as this
[VIDEO: Biden Slurs, Mumbles, Loses His Train of Thought, Wanders from Podium](https://www.newspageindex.com/08/2022/27/666684). The story features biased commentary from [Ronny Jackson](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=ronny%20jackson) (Trump’s former White House Doctor), who states, “Biden’s ‘press conference’ is disturbing and bizarre,” Jackson added. “He’s totally disconnected from reality. He has NO IDEA what’s going on. It’s no surprise he’s been kept locked away in the basement. This is an EMBARRASSMENT.”
Regarding sourcing, they frequently rely on social media and a mix of credible and questionable sources, such as
[Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/) and the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/).
Editorially all stories favor the right and usually denigrate the left; however, they appropriately label opinion content. In general, NewsPageIndex.com holds a strong right-leaning editorial bias and earns a mixed factual rating due to the use of poor sources that have failed numerous fact checks.
