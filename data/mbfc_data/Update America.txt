Analysis / Bias
In review, this website features news and opinions from a right-wing Christian perspective. Headlines often contain loaded emotional language that favors the right such as this:
[Pelosi FURIOUS After Learning Trump Wants to Bus Illegals to ‘Sanctuary Cities’](https://www.updateamerica.com/pelosi_furious_after_learning_trump_wants_to_bus_illegals_to_sanctuary_cities). This story is sourced to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and the Questionable [Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/). Update America does not perform original news reporting, but rather quotes news stories from mostly mainstream sources and interjects conservative opinions. Editorially, Update America is [Pro-Life](https://www.updateamerica.com/94_abortion_clinic_workers_were_so_shaken_by_unplanned_they_are_now_seeking_help) and [anti-LGBTQ](https://www.updateamerica.com/student_fights_for_right_to_privacy_after_transgender_student_watches_her_in_locker_room). In general, this a Christian Right website with a strong conservative bias.
