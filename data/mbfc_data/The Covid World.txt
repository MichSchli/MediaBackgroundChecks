History
[Founded in 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/thecovidworld.com), The Covid World is an anonymously published website that promotes Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories. According to their [about page](https://thecovidworld.com/about-us/), “The COVID World is a non-partisan, non-profit, independent news organization.”
The domain is registered in the United States, but the website otherwise completely lacks transparency as they do not name founders, editors, owners, or reveal their mission.

Analysis / Bias
The Covid World website publishes conspiracy and pseudoscience related to false flags, Covid-19, and the so-called Great Reset. Articles and headlines are highly emotional and misleading, such as this
[US Bioweapons Labs CONFIRMED As Deep State Sets Stage For Biowar False Flag Event To Be Blamed On Russia](https://thecovidworld.com/us-bioweapons-labs-confirmed-as-deep-state-sets-stage-for-biowar-false-flag-event-to-be-blamed-on-russia/). This misleading story is republished from Mike Adams of [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), a website that has become legendary for fake news. According to conservative fact-checker [The Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-dispatch/), there are no USA-funded Biolabs in the Ukraine [Fact Check: No, There Are No U.S.-Funded Bioweapons Labs in Ukraine](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-no-there-are-no-us-funded?s=r).
The website also publishes articles from Vernon Coleman, who has been described as an English “
[conspiracy theorist](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/how-we-can-fight-back-against-anti-vaxxer-scaremongering-on-social-media-923435),” “ [anti-vaccination activist](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-has-created-a-perfect-storm-for-fringe-science/),” who claims [AIDS does not exist](https://www.vernoncoleman.com/aids.htm), blogger, and novelist: [We’re In The Final Stages Of The Move Towards ‘The Great Reset’; We Must Win Now Or Lose Forever](https://thecovidworld.com/were-in-the-final-stages-of-the-move-towards-the-great-reset-we-must-win-now-or-lose-forever/). In this single article, they claim climate change is a fraud, manufactured media hysteria over the Russian Invasion; the west engineered the war, New World Order, Covid vaccines are killing many people, the jab is poisonous, and “We’ve got until the end of 2022 – if we’re lucky.” These claims have been [fact-checked](https://mythdetector.ge/en/anti-vax-union-british-unlicensed-doctor-spread-conspiracy-theories/). In general, The Covid World is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website that holds a strong right-leaning bias.
