Analysis / Bias
In 2022 Reporters Without Borders ranked India 142 out of 180 in their
[Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/india), stating, “Violence against journalists – including police violence, attacks by Maoist fighters, and reprisals by criminal groups or corrupt politicians – is one of the most striking characteristics of the current state of press freedom in India.”
In review, The Economic Times primarily covers financial, economic, and market news. Story selection and wording are often low biased such as this
[India to revamp scheme for states’ statistical capacity](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-to-revamp-scheme-for-states-statistical-capacity/articleshow/73192772.cms). This story is properly sourced. They also have a section that publishes political news, again with minimal bias in wording such as this [Governments should respect freedom of press: Supreme Court](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/governments-should-respect-freedom-of-press-supreme-court/articleshow/73193040.cms). Editorially, The Economic Times does not report very negatively on Right-leaning Prime Minister Modi and sometimes [heap praise](https://www.altnews.in/modi-sarkars-three-year-anniversary-celebrations-indian-medias-top-five-cheerleading-moments/) on him; however, they do offer some criticism such as this: [Modi’s grand coal plan could be up against too big a barrier](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/modis-grand-coal-plan-could-be-up-against-too-big-a-barrier/articleshow/73183672.cms). In general, they lean right based on editorial positions that favor the conservative government and often report misinformation.
When reporting on USA politics, they usually use the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) as a source: [Trump boasts Iranian general’s death was ‘American justice’.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trump-boasts-iranian-generals-death-was-american-justice/articleshow/73181609.cms)
