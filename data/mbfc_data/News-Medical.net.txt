Analysis / Bias
News-Medical.net curates press releases by hospitals, universities, and research institutions announcing peer-reviewed research. They also publish original articles on research development written by staff professionals in their respective fields. Headlines reflect the content of articles and use minimal bias in wording such as this
[Study reveals Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and immune response in clinically vulnerable individuals](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210906/Study-reveals-PfizerBioNTech-and-OxfordAstraZeneca-COVID-19-vaccine-efficacy-and-immune-response-in-clinically-vulnerable-individuals.aspx). Articles usually reference sources that are credible and related to the field of science they cover. In general, they are a mostly-factual pro-science source who has failed one fact-check.
