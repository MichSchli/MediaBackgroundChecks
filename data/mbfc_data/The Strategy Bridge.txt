Analysis / Bias
In review, The Strategy Bridge utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines and articles, for example:
[“Are Israeli Operations Against Gaza Rockets Productive?“](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2018/5/16/are-israeli-operations-against-gaza-rockets-productive) They also utilize credible sources such as Israel Defense Forces, credible right-leaning sources such as [jewishpolicycenter.org](https://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/2009/03/16/hamas-rocket-threat-after-operation-cast-lead/), and the Israeli think tank Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (BESA). According to [Haa](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5067855) [retz,](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5067855) BESA is traditionally regarded as a mostly right-wing organization. Other sources used are [The Jerusalem Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-jerusalem-post/) and highly factual pro-science sources such as [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/what-the-latest-strike-on-syria-succeeded-at-and-what-it-didnt/). Another example of solid sourcing is within the article [“A Pyongyang Spring? Not So Fast”,](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2018/5/10/a-pyongyang-spring-not-so-fast) which sources to the Least Biased [The Diplomat Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-diplomat-magazine/), Left-Center biased [The Verge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/), Left-Center [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), Left-Center [cnbc.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) as well as Left Biased [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/).
