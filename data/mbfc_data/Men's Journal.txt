History
[Men’s Journal](https://www.mensjournal.com/about-team/) is a monthly men’s lifestyle magazine covering various men’s lifestyle topics such as Health & Fitness, Food & Drink, Style, and Traveling. Like other male-targeted magazines, Men’s Journal includes stories about fashion and celebrities. [Rolling Stone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rolling-stone/) founder Jann Wenner [launched](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/business/men-s-journal-debut-set.html) Men’s Journal (MJ) in 1992. In 2017, Wenner sold Men’s Journal to [American Media Inc](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/business/wenner-media-to-sell-mens-journal-continuing-shift-from-print-media.html). It is now known as [a360media](https://accelerate360.com/2022/07/06/mens-journals-everyday-warrior-podcast-with-mike-sarraille/).

Analysis / Bias
Men’s Journal publishes articles and editorials on environmental issues, such as
[“How Fully (Un)prepared Is America for a Supercharged Electric Vehicle Rollout in the Near Future?”](https://www.mensjournal.com/gear/is-america-prepared-for-electric-vehicles-to-be-the-future/) This story is properly sourced from credible outlets such as Globalchange.mit.edu.
The primary focus of the magazine/website is on Men’s health and fitness, such as:
[“The Hamstring Workout That Helped Raiders Tight End Darren Waller Make His Big Comeback.”](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/raiders-tight-end-darren-waller-hamstring-workout/)
Regarding politics, they sometimes publish stories about major political figures like Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump regarding their health, fitness, and fashion taste. In analyzing these articles, MJ utilizes emotionally loaded language, typically positive toward Democratic party politicians, like this article about President Biden’s fashion taste: “
[Joe Biden Proves the Short-Sleeve Button-Down is Timeless](https://www.mensjournal.com/style/joe-biden-proves-the-short-sleeve-button-down-is-timeless-20140801/).” And this article about Obama’s fitness and health: “ [Obama Is Fit to Lead.”](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/obama-emisem-fit-lead/) However, when reporting on former President Donald Trump, they report negatively, such as this “ [We Know He’s Huuuge, But Is He Obese?”](https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/is-donald-trump-obese-an-investigation-w462910/)
Finally, Men’s Journal has made false and misleading claims when reporting on science and health by promoting pseudoscience, as evidenced below in our failed fact checks. Generally, Men’s Journal is mostly fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
