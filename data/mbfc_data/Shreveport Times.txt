Analysis / Bias
In review, The Shreveport Times covers local news through journalists and with minimal bias such as this:
[Bossier man pleads guilty for leadership role in anabolic steriod distribution conspiracy](https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/crime/2019/08/13/bossier-man-pleads-guilty-multiple-steroid-charges/2004117001/). National and international news is provided through the [Associated Press](https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/crime/2019/08/13/bossier-man-pleads-guilty-multiple-steroid-charges/2004117001/) and Gannett/Gatehouse publications. Editorially, Op-Eds tend to lean slightly right, though there is a reasonable amount of left-leaning opinions to provide a balance. In general, the Shreveport Times covers straight with minimal bias, while editorially there is a very slight right-leaning bias, but not enough to not rate this paper anything but Least Biased overall.
