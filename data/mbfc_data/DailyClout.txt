History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/dailyclout.io) by Naomi Wolf, the DailyClout is a website/blog that publishes news and opinions that currently align with an anti-establishment perspective. Naomi Wolf is an author who is known to be an advocate of [Third Wave Feminism](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/third-wave-feminism) in the 1990s. However, since 2014 Wolf has been [criticized](https://www.vox.com/2014/10/5/6909837/naomi-wolf-isis-ebola-scotland-conspiracy-theories) for promoting conspiracy theories.
In 2021, Naomi Wolf’s Twitter account was
[suspended](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/naomi-wolf-twitter-ban-vaccine-b1860320.html) due to promoting Covid-19 vaccine disinformation.
According to the DailyClout’s
[about page](https://dailyclout.io/our-story/), “Our mission is to empower all people with information, facts and opinion from all viewpoints, that when combined with DailyClout’s proprietary platform, enables them to be well informed and to exercise their rights to directly weigh-in on issues and legislation so that their voices are heard at the local, state or federal level.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Naomi Wolf is listed as the
[CEO](https://dailyclout.io/our-story/) and presumed [owner](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/naomi-wolf) of the DailyClout; however, this is not entirely transparent as there is no mention of other owners or funders. Advertising, membership fees, donations, and a shop that sells merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The DailyClout hosts Naomi Wolf’s podcast, publishes news, and has a feature called
[Billcam](https://billcam.dailyclout.io/?page=1) where you can view pending bills in congress. With Billcam you can learn more about the bill and vote on whether you support it.
News articles often highlight perceived limits on freedom, such as this
[Princeton Alumnus and Donor Steve Berger Writes to VP of Princeton Regarding Illegal Mandates](https://dailyclout.io/princeton-alumnus-donor-steve-berger-writes-to-vp-of-princeton-regarding-illegal-mandates/). They also routinely publish conspiracy and pseudoscience-related articles about Covid-19, such as this [A ‘Cover-Up of Evidence of Mass Murder’: The CDC Appears to Be Removing VAERS Records](https://dailyclout.io/a-cover-up-of-evidence-of-mass-murder-the-cdc-appears-to-be-removing-vaers-records/). This story relies on a Naturopathic Doctor as an authority on VAERS and vaccines. Furthermore, the information contained in the VAERS database is not reliable.
The VAERS website
[disclaims]that “anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS” and that content is not vetted before being made public; therefore, there is likely a significant amount of misinformation published. We also highly recommend this article [Understanding causality in adverse events after vaccination]as a way to understand why VAERS does not prove causality and why the numbers should not be taken literally.
Under the Opinion label, they again publish Covid-19 vaccine conspiracies, promote the “Great Reset,” and claim that Vaccines are Bioweapons
[Unholy Alliance Between Government, NGOs, and Big Tech Colluded to Smear and Deplatform COVID Dissidents](https://dailyclout.io/unholy-alliance-between-government-ngos-and-big-tech-colluded-to-smear-and-deplatform-covid-dissidents/). Covid vaccines are [not bioweapons](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-dont-alter-dna-arent-subjected-to-federal-regulation-bioweapons-david-martin/). In general, the DailyClout is a Quackery-level pseudoscience website that promotes conspiracy theories related to the government. Politically, the DailyClout aligns with the right.
