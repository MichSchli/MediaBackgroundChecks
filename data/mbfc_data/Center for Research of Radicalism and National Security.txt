History
The Centre for Research of Radicalism and National Security (CRRNS) is loaded with red flags. First, there isn’t an about page or any information about this website at all.
Funded by / Ownership
The website does not disclose ownership and uses a fake contact number: 044 (522) 123 4567 891. Advertising does not appear on the page nor does a donation link. The funding of this website is not known as well. Major red flag for a site that wants to sell it self as a think tank.
Analysis / Bias
News wise CRRNS has extreme pro-Israel bias and uses excessive loaded words such as:
[7 DAYS IN ENTEBBE – DISGUSTING PALESTINIAN PROPAGANDA](http://researchantisemitism.ca/7-days-entebbe-disgusting-palestinian-propaganda/). The website is designed to look like a legit think tank, but it most certainly is not based on lack of financial and disclosure of information. This is a propaganda site.
