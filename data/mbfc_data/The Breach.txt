Analysis / Bias
BreachMedia.ca, with its progressive outlook, frequently addresses issues like national politics and social justice, as seen in
[“Toronto police’s secretive ”no-knock raids leave scars for a lifetime.” ](https://breachmedia.ca/toronto-police-no-knock-raids/) The article uses emotionally loaded language, particularly in its title and descriptions, such as “stormed inside with guns drawn,” to critique these raids. It includes expert opinions from Howard Morton, a former director of the Toronto police’s Special Investigations Unit, and Marta-Marika Urbanik, a criminology professor, who provide critical perspectives on the raids’ implications and sources such as Justice.gov, [Toronto Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-star/), and [Research Gate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/researchgate/). While the narrative presents the victims’ perspectives and expert critiques on no-knock raids, which may appear unbalanced, the article also mentions the police’s refusal to comment or provide data, which affects the ability to offer a more comprehensive view.
Similarly, another article titled
[“Cops crashed my talk on Palestine (and proved my point about colonialism)”](https://breachmedia.ca/toronto-police-crashed-york-lecture-palestine-muhannad-ayyash/) uses a personal incident to critique anti-Palestinian sentiments in academic settings. Reflecting the outlet’s progressive stance, the piece blends the author’s experiences with broader social justice themes. Cited sources include [CBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/), [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/), [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/), University of Alberta Press, and [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/).
In general, as a progressive news platform, this outlet’s articles reflect its editorial viewpoint but are based on well-sourced information, including stakeholder interviews, government documents, and established media references. Although it sometimes references sources like Al Jazeera, known for a mixed factual rating, the bulk of its citations are from widely regarded credible sources, ensuring the reliability of its reporting.
