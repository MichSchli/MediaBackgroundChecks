Analysis / Bias
In review, openDemocracy has a left bias in reporting and political affiliation, however, all articles are well-sourced and evidence-based. Headline utilize moderately loaded wording such as this:
[Will person-to-person politics put wind in Corbyn’s sails?](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/will-person-to-person-politics-put-wind-in-corbyns-sails/) Opinion pieces are labeled appropriately and news stories are generally factual and sourced to credible links. In general, most stories favor the left and denigrate the right.
