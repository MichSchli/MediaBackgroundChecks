Analysis / Bias
In review, the Pensacola News Journal reports local news through the use of reporters and journalists, whereas national news is reported through USA Today and the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). There is minimal use of loaded language and all information is properly sourced. [Editorially](https://www.pnj.com/opinion/columnists/), slightly more articles favor the left, but there is a reasonable balance present. A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=pensacola%20news%20journal&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have never failed a fact check.
