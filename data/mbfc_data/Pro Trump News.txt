History
[Founded on 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/protrumpnews.com), Pro Trump News is a hyper-partisan site that completely matches its name. They support and promote Pro-Trump propaganda exclusively by linking news articles to questionable and far-right sources. This site could also be classified as a fake imposter site as they mimic the [Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/) in layout. Basically, this source completely lacks transparency as there is zero disclosure.
Funded by / Ownership
Pro Trump News does not disclose ownership. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Pro Trump News links to news stories that favor President Trump or denigrate the left with a website that looks like the
[Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/). This is an attempt to be a fake site that acts as an imposter to a real website. Essentially, this website curates positive news for President Trump with little regard to how credible the source is. For example, in this story, [CNN Panel Celebrates Impeachment As Great Day For Democracy, Toobin Says Trump ‘Deserved It’ (VIDEO)](https://americanlookout.com/cnn-panel-celebrates-impeachment-as-great-day-for-democracy-toobin-says-trump-deserved-it-video/), which leads to [American Lookout](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-lookout/), which we have rated as Questionable. The bottom line is that most of the website links lead to Questionable sources. This is not a credible source.
Failed Fact Checks
- The website provides links to sources like the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/)that fails fact checks nearly daily.
