Analysis / Bias
In review, NPC Daily publishes satire stories that typically poke fun at the left such as this:
[Racists bully “Justice Democrats PAC” and Socialist Leader AOC – Claim PAC missing only one million dollars](https://npcdaily.com/2573/racists-bully-justice-democrats-pac-and-socialist-leader-aoc-claim-pac-missing-only-one-million-dollars/). Most importantly, NPC Daily fully disclaims their satire: “NPC Daily is a satire site, providing political and cultural commentary with wanton sarcasm. NPC Daily pokes fun of modern journalism and liberalism. If you believe one of our articles is real, it’s because the content is not too far adrift from what is published by mainstream news outlets. But, alas, our content is totally fictitious and is created to elicit laughs and bemusement.”
