History
[Founded in 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahram), Al-Ahram is a daily broadsheet newspaper based in Cairo, Egypt, and is one of the largest circulating papers in the world. Ahram Online is an English online version of the paper. Ahram Online was launched on 26 November 2010.

Funded by / Ownership
Ahram Online is owned by the Al-Ahram Foundation, managed by the Egyptian government’s “
[Supreme Council of Press.](https://accountablejournalism.org/ethics-codes/egypt-supreme-council-of-the-press)” The [Egyptian government owns](http://www.pressreference.com/Co-Fa/Egypt.html) a controlling share of the stocks of the paper and appoints the editors. As appointees of the state, little censorship is exercised over them; it is understood that they are loyal to the state.
Analysis / Bias
[According to Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/egypt), “Egypt is now one of the world’s biggest jailers of journalists. Some spend years in detention without being charged or tried.” They further report, “The press freedom situation has become more and more alarming under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has orchestrated a “Sisification” of the media.” [Abdel Fattah al-Sisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi) is difficult to classify on a left-right scale. The best description would be a nationalistic military dictator who wields near 100% control of the Government.
In review, Ahram Online covers Egyptian news through journalists who utilize minimally loaded language:
[Egypt’s Sisi, Ethiopia’s PM Ahmed agree that GERD technical committee should resume work](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/354616/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Sisi,-Ethiopias-PM-Ahmed-agree-that-GERD-te.aspx). Although the wording is typically neutral, you will not find criticism of the Government on this website. Further, most stories covering President al-Sisi are favorable such as this: [Egypt’s Sisi praises SCC’s role in protecting justice, rights, freedoms](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/353231/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Sisi-praises-SCC%E2%80%99s-role-in-protecting-justi.aspx). When covering Western/USA news, they frequently use news wires such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/): [Trump says ceasefire in Syria is holding despite few skirmishes](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/353353/World/International/Trump-says-ceasefire-in-Syria-is-holding-despite-f.aspx). In general, international news is low biased and factual, while domestic news is highly biased in favor of the ruling Government. Based on one-sided reporting and oppressive censorship, we must rate Ahram Online Mixed for factual reporting due to promoting pro-Government propaganda.
