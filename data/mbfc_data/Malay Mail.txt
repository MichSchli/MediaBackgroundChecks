Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/malaysia), Malaysia is being “threatened by increasing censorship.”
In review, the Malaysia Mail uses loaded language in their headlines and articles such as
[“As 2020 looms, is right-wing politics on the rise in Malaysia Baharu?”](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/12/30/as-2020-looms-is-right-wing-politics-on-the-rise-in-malaysia-baharu/1823166) Articles tend to be sourced through quotes; however, they report international news with [low bias](https://www.malaysia-today.net/dojs-1mdb-probe-independent-of-najib-trump-meet/) and maintain factual reporting by utilizing credible news agencies such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) [“Biden pushes for long Covid sufferers to be protected by law.”](https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2021/07/27/biden-pushes-for-long-covid-sufferers-to-be-protected-by-law/1992899) Further, the Malay Mail also publishes clickbait tabloid-style articles such as [“Having the urge for ‘casual sex’? Malaysian expert points out why some partners cheat.”](https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2020/05/08/having-the-urge-for-casual-sex-malaysian-expert-points-out-why-some-partner/1864366)
Editorially, they are critical of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), a
[progressive](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/08/18/malaysia-s-political-polarization-race-religion-and-reform-pub-82436) center-left Malaysian political party that is predominantly Chinese, represents non-Malays, and advocates secularism such as [“Cautioning DAP against becoming non-Malay harbor, Chin Tong says ‘Middle Malaysia’ is only way.”](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2021/12/07/cautioning-dap-against-becoming-non-malay-harbour-chin-tong-says-middle-mal/2026583) In general, the Malay Mail publishes mostly factual news and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
