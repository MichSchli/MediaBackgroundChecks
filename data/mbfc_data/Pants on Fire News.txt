Analysis / Bias
Pants on Fire News does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left such as this:
[Ted Cruz shut down Chuck Todd with one epic truth bomb](https://pantsonfirenews.com/ted-cruz-shut-down-chuck-todd-with-one-epic-truth-bomb/). This story utilizes tweets and a video clip from [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/) as the source. We also found that they often do not use hyperlinked sourcing on information they are referencing.
The website also has a category called “Fake News,” where it seems they publish news about media outlets who report falsely, such as this story:
[This Fake News outlet pushed a massive lie right before the Biden DOJ made a ground-breaking admission](https://pantsonfirenews.com/this-fake-news-outlet-pushed-a-massive-lie-right-before-the-biden-doj-made-a-ground-breaking-admission/). In this story, they attempt to paint [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) as a fake news outlet.
In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing pro-Trump conspiracy theories and propaganda while sometimes using poor sources such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). For example, they promote [election fraud conspiracies](https://pantsonfirenews.com/rand-paul-destroyed-one-liberal-journalist-with-this-election-truth/) and disinformation regarding [Covid-19](https://pantsonfirenews.com/big-tech-is-trying-to-censor-one-undeniable-truth-about-the-covid-vaccine/).
