Founded in 2021 by Jim Hoft, owner of the Far-Right Questionable
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), American Gulag is a website that reports on what they deem “political prisoners” from the January 6th, 2021 Capitol Riot. According to the [about page](https://americangulag.org/about-us/), “AmericanGulag.org is a project of Jim Hoft for the benefit of the public and to provide sunshine and publicity to the scores of political prisoners wrongfully imprisoned as a result of the protest on January 6th.”
The about page adds, “There were a handful of bad actors, but the overwhelming majority of the prisoners are husbands and fathers and sons, wives and mothers and daughters — good Americans whose only crime was being invited into a public building. To suit the political purposes of the Democratic Party, these Americans have been abused, assaulted, locked in solitary confinement, and denied medical treatment.”

Funded by / Ownership
Jim Hoft owns American Gulag. The website does not have advertising but solicits donations that it allegedly gives to the so-called “Political Prisoners.” They state: “We are raising money for the families of the Jan. 6 political prisoners. Any amount raised over and above the amount needed for our investigations will be applied to legal fees and other expenses incurred. Please consider supporting these persecuted and suffering men and women today.”
Analysis / Bias
American Gulag lists the names of those arrested during the Capitol Riots. They provide links to the individual’s demographics and their charges such as this on the
[QAnon Shaman](https://americangulag.org/jacob-anthony-chansley/). The profiles are designed to elicit sympathy, such as claiming the QAnon Shaman led people in prayer and gave instructions on obeying police orders.
The website also provides news related to the Capitol Riot and the defendants, republished from The Gateway Pundit. For example, they promote false flag conspiracies from the Gateway Pundit, such as this

In general, they promote misinformation and conspiracy theories on the January 6th Capitol Riot directly from the Gateway Pundit. The Gateway Pundit is considered one of the least credible sources on the internet.
