Analysis / Bias
The Irish News reports news for Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom in general, relying on journalists and credible sources such as the UK’s news agency
[PA Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pa-media-uk-bias/) and the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/). News reporting is fact-based and does not rely on emotional wording such as this: [Storm Isha: Man dies after car struck by tree in Limavady](https://www.irishnews.com/news/northern-ireland/power-outages-and-flights-axed-as-storm-isha-sweeps-across-island-of-ireland-ZUKUVKDGCVMBXIBKLHQHECROEE/). This story is written by Irish News Journalists and sourced through PA Media.
Editorially, The Irish News favors Irish nationalism and often reflects these views in its commentary. For example, the article titled
[Nationalists urged not to be disheartened by poll support for united Ireland](https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/04/05/news/nationalists-urged-not-to-be-disheartened-by-poll-support-for-united-ireland-2633602/) discusses polling results that suggest a growing, though not yet majority, support for Irish unity. The article encourages Irish nationalists not to lose hope and draws parallels with other independence movements, suggesting a long-term increase in support for Irish unity.
When reporting on the current government of Ireland, in particular right-leaning Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and his party, Fine Gael, they usually strike a balance of positive and negative criticism. However, reporting on the opposition party, Sinn Féin, whose political stance is rooted in the belief that Ireland should be a single, independent nation, free from British rule, they strike a more favorable tone like this:
[Sinn Féin-led Irish government would deliver ‘step change’ in Irish unity push](https://www.irishnews.com/news/ireland/sinn-fein-led-irish-government-would-deliver-step-change-in-irish-unity-push-I2JZXD4XEFCOJPCYBX2EDUYY3Y/). On political issues, they also slightly favor the left with concern for [climate change](https://www.irishnews.com/news/uk/sunak-accused-of-having-fingers-in-ears-over-climate-change-3EBSK4C3VBKMVKYU3LJDYMXW2I/) and support for [LGBTQ+ rights](https://www.irishnews.com/news/uknews/2023/11/16/news/lgbtq_people_facing_abuse_when_travelling_in_london_report-3775296/).
In general, The Irish News is fact-based in reporting and holds a slightly left-leaning political viewpoint related to Irish Nationalism and social issues.
