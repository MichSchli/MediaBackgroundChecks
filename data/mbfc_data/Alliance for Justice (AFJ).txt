[Founded in 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_Justice), the Alliance for Justice (AFJ) is a progressive judicial advocacy group in the United States. AFJ monitors federal judicial appointments and represents a coalition of 100 politically liberal groups interested in the federal judiciary. The Alliance for Justice presents a [liberal viewpoint](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/supreme-court-gorsuch-filibuster.html) on legal issues. According to their [about page](https://www.afj.org/about-afj), “AFJ works to ensure that the federal judiciary advances core constitutional values, preserves human rights and unfettered access to the courts, and adheres to the even-handed administration of justice for all Americans.” The current president is [Nan Aron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nan_Aron), who is also the founder.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Alliance for Justice is opposed to conservative judges, especially those who are
[anti-abortion](https://www.afj.org/blog/the-very-real-and-devastating-consequences-of-texas-anti-abortion-restrictions). They use moderate-loaded language when describing Conservatives/Trump such as this: [Trump’s Judicial Nominees: A Threat to Our Justice System](https://www.afj.org/reports/trump-judicial-nominees-a-threat-to-our-justice-system). The information contained in articles is factually sourced to credible media and/or .gov information. AFJ [strongly](https://www.afj.org/press-room/press-releases/afj-review-of-kavanaugh-record-highlights-extreme-views) opposed former President Trump’s nominee for the SCOTUS, Brett Kavanaugh. In general, AFJ advocates for liberal justices.
