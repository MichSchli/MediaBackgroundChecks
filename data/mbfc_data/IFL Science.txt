History
IFLScience, short for I F#cking Love Science, began as a Facebook page in 2012. It then became a popular website that publishes light popular science stories. According to their
[about page](https://www.iflscience.com/about/), “IFLScience is a UK-based science website that is a part of LabX Media Group, a Canadian-based corporation.” The founder of IFLS, who is no longer affiliated with the website, was [Elise Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Andrew). The current managing editor is [Katy Evans](https://www.iflscience.com/team/katy-evans/), and [Johannes Van Zijl](https://www.iflscience.com/team/johannes-van-zijl/) serves as the editorial director.

Analysis / Bias
In review, IFLScience is challenging to place into a category. Mostly, the website’s information is pro-science and properly sourced from credible science or other popular science sources. However, IFLS has strong political opinions that align with a liberal perspective, such as this:
[Here’s A List Of All The Science That Donald Trump Denies: Second Edition](https://www.iflscience.com/policy/heres-list-all-science-donald-trump-denies-second-edition/) or [Science Knowledge Has Almost No Effect On Republican Beliefs, According To Survey](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/science-knowledge-has-almost-no-effect-on-republican-beliefs-according-to-survey/). In general, a survey of stories that relate to politics shows a left-leaning bias in story selection and political association.
While IFLS does not state they hold a left-leaning perspective, they disclose some of the political issues they cover in their
[mission statement:](https://www.iflscience.com/editorial-mission-statement/) “There’s no escaping; some science is political. From government decisions on policies affecting health to global decisions on how to tackle the human-induced effects of climate change or evidence-based analysis of institutional racism, science and politics are inextricably intertwined.” Opinion content is properly labeled.
The primary focus of the website is presenting easy-to-understand science stories that are on the lighter side. IFLS supports the consensus with
[Vaccinations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). Further, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have consistently promoted fact-based scientific information such as this [Prior Exposure To Seasonal Coronaviruses Might Increase COVID-19 Vulnerability](https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/prior-exposure-to-seasonal-coronaviruses-might-increase-covid19-vulnerability/). However, some stories are speculative: [Pieces Of A “UFO” Fell From The Sky And Landed In Remote Cambodian Village](https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/pieces-of-a-ufo-fell-from-the-sky-and-landed-in-remote-cambodian-village/). These types of stories are derived from other sources, and IFL is just reporting it as is. The information presented is fact-based, pro-science, and holds a left-leaning bias when discussing political issues.
