Analysis / Bias
RadarOnline specializes in sensational and exclusive stories, often featuring eye-catching headlines and strong language. For example, an article about
[Lamar Odom and Shannon Beador](https://radaronline.com/p/lamar-odom-reaches-out-shannon-beador-rhoc-real-housewives-orange-county-arrest-offering-treatment-center/) uses exclusive language like “insider” and portrays the individuals in a non-neutral manner. Here is a quote from the article: “An insider tells us Odom has yet to hear back from Beador but has not given up.” The article cites Vanity Wellness Center and factually mixed [TMZ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tmz/#google_vignette) as external sources.
Similarly, an article about Lauren Boebert,
[“Political Group Accuses Lauren Boebert of ‘Illegal Acts,’ Calling On U.S. Attorney in Colorado to Investigate Embattled GOP Rep](https://radaronline.com/p/lauren-boebert-political-group-calls-for-colorado-attorney-office-investigate-politican-lawsuit-accusations/),” employs strong language like “embattled” and “illegal acts” to create a sense of urgency and “accusing the two-term congresswoman of ‘allegedly using drugs'” indicate a framing that is critical of Boebert. The article employs sensational elements to capture the reader’s attention. Terms like “embattled,” “MAGA-loving,” and “illegal acts” are used to create a sense of scandal. The article cites a letter from David B. Wheeler, the head of the political action group American Muckrakers. It includes quotes from Lauren Boebert and her estranged husband, Jayson Boebert, and justice.gov. Despite citing some sources like justice.gov, the sensational tone undermines journalistic standards.
The outlet’s coverage spans Democratic (
[‘It Doesn’t Matter’: Stuttering President Joe Biden Struggles to Pronounce Acronym for Pacific Islands Infrastructure Initiative)](https://radaronline.com/p/joe-biden-struggles-acronym-pacific-islands-infrastructure-initiative/) and Republican (See Boebert above) figures, emphasizing their flaws or controversies rather than their policy positions or achievements. Given its sensational tone and focus on questionable exclusive claims, RadarOnline fits the characteristics of tabloid journalism. With numerous failed fact checks, they are also rated low for factual reporting.
