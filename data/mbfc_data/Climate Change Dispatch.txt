History
[Founded in 2010](http://whois.domaintools.com/climatechangedispatch.com), Climate Change Dispatch is a human-influenced climate change denial blog managed and edited by Thomas Richard. According to their [about page](https://climatechangedispatch.com/about-us/): “Climate Change Dispatch (CCD) is a science and environmental news site showing its visitors the facts behind the theory of global warming, which are not being told by the mainstream media and the global-warming zealots. As noted below*, we do not believe in consensus science. Beliefs belong in church, in prayers, but not in the scientific method.” [Read our profile on USA media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Articles contain loaded emotional language such as this: [Election Slaughter For Climate Activism](https://climatechangedispatch.com/election-slaughter-climate-activism/). This story is a republishing of James Taylor’s article written for the right biased and factually mixed [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/).
In general, most content on this website is republished articles from other right-biased sources that question climate change. There is some original content published as well that also works to minimize concern over climate change. This source also promotes conspiracies, such as
[Oxford University publishing fake news](https://climatechangedispatch.com/oxford-university-spreads-fake-news-about-basic-geology/). Essentially, this is a website that promotes anti-climate change propaganda.
