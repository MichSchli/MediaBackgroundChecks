Funded by / Ownership
Flex Mag does not disclose ownership and the website appears to be funded solely through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
Flex Mag publishes news with an extreme right bias that only favors the Right. There is excessive use of loaded language that is very poorly written such as this:
[Muslims From USA: â€˜We Will Try To Impeach President Donald Trump, We Need To Bring Sharia Law Into American Culture. Do You Support Trump If He Deport All Of Them?](http://www.usafortrumponline.com/2018/03/02/muslims-from-usa-we-will-try-to-impeach-president-donald-trump-we-need-to-bring-sharia-law-into-american-culture-do-you-support-trump-if-he-deport-all-of-them/) This article then sources to a broken link. Other articles, such as [this one](http://www.usafortrumponline.com/2018/07/29/jim-jordan-tramples-ryan-goes-full-steam-ahead-on-rosensteins-impeachment/), is sourced to another Questionable source called the [Patriot Beat](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/patriot-beat/). For the most part, the website publishes [old debunked conspiracy theories](http://www.usafortrumponline.com/2018/02/20/katie-couric-speaks-out-on-canceling-clinton-interview-it-was-over-when-she-called-him-the-n-word/) that are so poorly written they are nearly noncomprehending.
