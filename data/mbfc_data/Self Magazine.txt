Their health section features [Health Conditions A-Z](https://www.self.com/health-conditions), which focuses on women’s health issues and concerns. Most information in this section links to other Self articles and credible sources such as the [American Cancer Society](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-cancer-society-bias/).
Editorially, they report on political issues with a moderate liberal bias. For example, they frequently report negatively on conservatives, and their policies such as this
