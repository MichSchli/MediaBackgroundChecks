Analysis / Bias
From our previous review in 2017, we reported that En Volve is extremely right-biased news and opinion website. En-Volve has also published ridiculous stories such as “
[Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statue of Himself to Be Permanently Installed in White House?](http://Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statue of Himself to Be Permanently Installed in White House?)” and this “ [Colin Kaepernick FIRED From 49ers After Disrespecting Police and National Anthem](http://en-volve.com/2016/09/04/colin-kaepernick-fired-from-49ers-after-disrespecting-police-and-national-anthem/),” which obviously is not true as he played the entire season with them after this fake news article was published. Since the last review, they have continued to publish similar misinformation. For the most part, they republish articles from Questionable sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [True Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/true-pundit/), and even [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/).
For example, during the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020-22, they reported conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates and vaccines such as this
[Bill Gates Pushes For One-World Government With “Pandemic Fire Squads” To Control The Masses.](https://en-volve.com/2021/02/04/bill-gates-pushes-for-one-world-government-with-pandemic-fire-squads-to-control-the-masses/) They also reported debunked election fraud misinformation such as this [Bombshell: New Evidence Of Election Fraud In NH As Dominion Machines Found To Have Taken 300 Votes Off EVERY Republican Candidate](https://en-volve.com/2021/02/11/bombshell-new-evidence-of-election-fraud-in-nh-as-dominion-machines-found-to-have-taken-300-votes-off-every-republican-candidate/). According to [US intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ICA-declass-16MAR21.pdf), there is no substantial domestic election fraud evidence. In general, En Volve is Extreme right biased and frequently publishes conspiracy theories, fake news, and has zero credibility.
