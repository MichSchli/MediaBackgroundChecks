History
[Founded in December 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/vancouvertimes.org) by Jason Pires, the Vancouver Times is a blog that publishes local, national, and world news from a conservative perspective. According to their [about page](https://vancouvertimes.org/about/), “Vancouver Times is the most trusted source for satire on the West Coast. We write satirical stories about issues that affect conservatives. We are not affiliated with the mainstream media (CBC, CTV etc.) in any way, and any [similarities](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/the-day-i-met-me-jason-pires-meets-another-jason-pires-1.4551679) between our content and the work of the MSM is purely coincidental.” [Read our profile on Canadian media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canada-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Vancouver Times republishes a one-sentence summary of local BC/Canadian news from
[Global News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-news/); however, they do not provide a hyperlink to read the full article. Under the “America” news category, they republish full articles from the Right-Biased and Questionable [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). Under the “World” category, they republish [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) articles without providing a hyperlink resulting in significant copyright infringement and plagiarism.
Finally, under the “Original” category, Jason Pires summarizes existing news stories from other sources while adding
[commentary](https://vancouvertimes.org/group-calling-for-more-covid-restrictions-in-bc/) that favors a conservative perspective, such as this “Many Canadians are opposed to increased Covid restrictions, calling them authoritarian and a breach of civil liberties. Some have gone as far as protesting hospitals or the homes of politicians.”
In general, the news republished in the Vancouver Times is fact-based, with story selection that favors the Right. Unfortunately, they do not hyperlink to the republishing sources and therefore lack credibility. Further, although they produce satirical articles, they are not labeled as such and therefore misleading.
