Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the website, it is hard to imagine that a once credible journalist could support and write for a tin foil hat conspiracy website such as this. The primary conspiracies promoted on this website are Geoengineering and
[Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/). There is also a promotion of [9-11 conspiracies.](https://usawatchdog.com/is-the-911-conspiracy-theory-insane-or-insightful/) Further, Greg Hunter lists his [favorite websites](https://usawatchdog.com/is-the-911-conspiracy-theory-insane-or-insightful/), which reads like a who’s who of conspiracy and questionable sources. USAWatchdog.com also reports financial news that is generally credible, though again, they sometimes promote [economic conspiracies](https://usawatchdog.com/perfect-storm-of-financial-collapse-and-wwiii-michael-snyder/) that they claim will lead to WW III.
Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, USAWatchdog frequently promoted false or misleading information such as
[vaccine shedding](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/may/06/debunking-anti-vaccine-hoax-about-vaccine-shedding/), which is not possible [Unvaxed at Risk from Vaxed in Coming Dark Winter – Karen Kingston](https://web.archive.org/web/20211020182827/https://usawatchdog.com/unvaxed-at-risk-from-vaxed-in-coming-dark-winter-karen-kingston/). Finally, after the 2020 Presidential election, they consistently reported election fraud such as this [AZ Audit Proves 2020 Election Fraud, Biden Attacks Unvaxed, USA is Broke](https://web.archive.org/web/20211020192128/https://usawatchdog.com/az-audit-proves-2020-election-fraud-biden-attacks-unvaxed-usa-is-broke/). This claim is [false](https://apnews.com/article/elections-media-arizona-ap-fact-check-phoenix-96f95a57cd361006d3398b0902a3e0d8). In general, most stories on USAWatchDog strongly favor the right and frequently promote misinformation.
