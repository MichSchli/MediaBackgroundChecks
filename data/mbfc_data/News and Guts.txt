Funded by / Ownership
The website does not openly disclose ownership; however, we have determined that billionaire
[Mark Cuban](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/04/30/dan-rather-mark-cuban-has-the-guts-my-cbs-bosses-lacked/#132d5f5438e8) provided the primary seed funding for this website through research. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, although funded through billionaire Mark Cuban, the website maintains that Dan Rather has complete editorial control over the content presented. News and Guts primarily aggregate news from other sources such as
[Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), the [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), and other left-leaning media outlets. Original content comes from News and Guts staff or Dan Rather himself and is usually properly sourced. However, there are times when original content features loaded emotional language such as this: [Dan Rather: We Have Seen Cowardice When We Need Leadership](https://www.newsandguts.com/dan-rather-we-have-seen-cowardice-when-we-need-leadership/).
Editorially, News and Guts often do not report favorably on the right or former President Trump, such as this:
[Will Your Drinking Water be Safe? Trump Dumps Obama Clean-Water Rules](https://www.newsandguts.com/will-your-drinking-water-be-safe-trump-dumps-obama-clean-water-rules/). This story is properly sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). In general, story selection favors the moderate left and is always sourced to credible information.
