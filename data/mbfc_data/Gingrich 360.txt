Analysis / Bias
Gingrich 360, founded by Newt Gingrich, encompasses a range of multimedia content, including articles reflecting Gingrich’s political and historical perspectives. This analysis assesses the platform’s content, particularly its articles, for bias and credibility.
Newt Gingrich’s background as a politician and
[“historian”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/newt-gingrich-historian-fact-checker-biography/2011/12/13/gIQAJqiMsO_blog.html) (He has faced criticism for his political and partisan approach to history and for using the title “historian” in a political context, which some historians and fact-checkers have disputed.) significantly influences the content of Gingrich 360. His varied stance on scientific issues, especially [climate change](https://www.science.org/content/article/newt-gingrich-major-trump-ally-has-complicated-love-affair-science), and strong affiliation with the [Republican Party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/08/05/tracing-republican-partys-devolution-one-man-newt-gingrich/) and former President [Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) are reflected in the site’s tone and perspective. Articles such as [“The Left Will Never Stop Attacking Trump”](https://www.gingrich360.com/2023/04/06/trump-is-the-indictment/) demonstrate a clear right-wing bias, portraying Trump’s indictment as a result of political animosity rather than legal grounds.
Gingrich’s writing style, marked by emotive language and an us-versus-them narrative, caters to Trump’s supporters, often depicting them as targets of a biased establishment. This approach indicates conservative, pro-Trump opinion journalism, prioritizing political interpretation over impartial analysis.
Adding to this analysis is the article
[“The Delaware Sopranos Put America’s Survival at Risk](https://www.gingrich360.com/2023/11/13/the-delaware-sopranos/),” which criticizes the Biden administration and suggests a corrupt family dynamic akin to a criminal organization. (TV show [Sopranos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/)) This article further exemplifies the site’s right-leaning bias and preference for politically charged narratives over objective reporting.
Finally, the website also promotes baseless conspiracy theories like the debunked Seth Rich
[conspiracy theory](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/gingrich-spreads-conspiracy-theory/) in 2017 and the 2020 election being stolen from Donald Trump: [What Can We Do To Stop the Steal?](https://www.gingrich360.com/2020/11/18/newts-world-episode-154-what-can-you-do-to-stop-the-steal/) This article has been removed from the website but still exists in the [archive](https://archive.ph/ENkvx). In general, Gingrich 360 holds far-right biases and is not always factual.
