Analysis / Bias
In review, PinkNews reports on the political progress of LGBT rights around the world and carries interviews with cultural figures, politicians, and British Prime Ministers. News headlines often contain loaded emotional wording such as this:
[‘You f**king queer p**fs’: Gay bakers sent hate-filled homophobic letter](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/09/21/you-fking-queer-pfs-gay-bakers-sent-hate-filled-homophobic-letter/). This story is appropriately sourced to the Evening News. The paper often reports negatively on conservatives and evangelical Christians, such as this: [‘How can you be lesbian and Christian?’ Home Office using religion against LGBT asylum seekers, says report](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/09/20/home-office-asylum-lgbt-religion-study-metropolitan-community-church-london/). Most content on PinkNews is original and well-sourced.
Editorially, PinkNews does not endorse candidates based on the party but rather on whether they are
[pro-LGBT](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/editorial-policy/). PinkNews clearly labels its opinion pieces, and they are often well-sourced with credible information. Op-eds favor gay rights and liberal positions.
