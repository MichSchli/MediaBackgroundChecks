In review, The Ajax News Advertiser uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Drivers being warned of closures on Highway 401 in Pickering and Ajax as well as Oshawa Dec. 6-9 that could cause traffic problems](https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/10805656-drivers-being-warned-of-closures-on-highway-401-in-pickering-and-ajax-as-well-as-oshawa-dec-6-9-that-could-cause-traffic-problems/). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
