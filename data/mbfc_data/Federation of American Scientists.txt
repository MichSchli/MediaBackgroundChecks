History
The
[Federation of American Scientists (FAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_American_Scientists) is a 501(c)(3) organization with the stated intent of using science and scientific analysis to attempt to make the world more secure. FAS was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bombs. The current president is Ali Nouri.
The mission of FAS is to promote a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology security policy problems by educating the public and policymakers and promoting transparency through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy. This mission was established early on and deemed necessary for the federation, as decisions made by the United States during the conception of the FAS were critical in shaping international relations.
