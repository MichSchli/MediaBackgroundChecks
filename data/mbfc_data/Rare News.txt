History
Founded in 2013, Rare is a website that publishes trending, odd and political news. They describe themselves as “America’s News Feed.” According to their

Rare is based in Nashville, Tennessee, and lacks transparency as they do not disclose their conservative perspective.

Analysis / Bias
Rare breaks its news into sections such as News, Politics, and Trending. Rare does not perform original reporting but rather summarizes news from other sources. Many stories are sensational and weird such as this
[Naked Woman Charged After Falling Through A Fast Food Restaurant’s Ceiling](https://rare.us/rare-news/across-the-u-s-a/naked-woman-falling-through-restaurants-ceiling/). This story is sourced from a local police report and video. They also occasionally publish stories that could be classified as conspiracy theories such as this [In 1960 the US Government Sprayed Chemical Weapons Throughout Neighborhoods](https://rare.us/rare-news/history/st-louis-test-spray/). This story is sourced from the questionable [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/).
Editorially, Rare does not directly publish opinion pieces; however, political news reporting routinely favors a conservative perspective and often denigrates the left, in particular, President Biden, such as this
[Joe Biden Lied About Being A Civil Rights Activist](https://rare.us/rare-news/2024-election/joe-biden-lied-about-being-a-civil-rights-activist/). This story makes numerous claims but only provides a video from RNC research as evidence. Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they published unsubstantiated articles such as this citing the Questionable [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) show: [Tucker Carlson Interviews Chinese Virologist About Wuhan Lab Leak](https://rare.us/rare-politics/tucker-carlson-interviews-chinese-virologist-about-wuhan-lab-leak-video/). In this interview, the Virologist claims “not only did COVID-19 originate at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but that it was also released intentionally.” As of this date in July 2023, there is [no evidence](https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj.p1556) as to how Covid-19 originated.
The website also publishes news that is false such as this:
[Biden Administration Refuses To Give RFK Jr. Secret Service Detail](https://rare.us/rare-news/2024-election/biden-administration-refuses-to-give-rfk-jr-secret-service-detail/). First, the Biden Administration does not decide who gets security detail. Second, [RFK Jr](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). is lying as the secret service does not provide security to candidates until [120 days before the election](https://www.secretservice.gov/about/faq/general#:~:text=In%20regard%20to%20presidential%20campaign,of%20a%20general%20presidential%20election). That is only for popular or legitimate candidates, which RFK is not at this point. Robert F. Kennedy has a very poor track record with fact-checkers. In general, Rare.Us is consistently right-biased and not always factual in reporting.
