Analysis / Bias
In review, Daily Kos reports news through bloggers, who generally lean strongly left. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[Voting Rights Roundup: Michigan GOP attempts to sabotage redistricting reform by withholding funding](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/5/17/1858473/-Voting-Rights-Roundup-Michigan-GOP-attempts-to-sabotage-redistricting-reform-by-withholding-funding). This particular article is properly sourced from credible mainstream media outlets and newspapers. In some articles, there is a very strong use of emotional wording such as this: [This is how Republicans get away with their lies: The media lets them do it, again and again](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/5/17/1858454/-This-is-how-Republicans-get-away-with-their-lies-The-media-lets-them-do-it-again-and-again).
Most articles are written by community members, with the rest written by staff members. Editorially, there is a very strong left bias with mostly positive articles in favor of left-leaning positions and denigration of conservatives. In general, all information tends to favor the left. Most articles are sourced; however, some of the information written by community members is not vetted by Daily Kos and may contain factual errors or extreme bias.
