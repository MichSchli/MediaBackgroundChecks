History
GiveSendGo was
[founded in 2014](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/givesendgo-crowdfunding-extremism/) as a response to GoFundMe’s perceived bias against Christian campaigns. According to their [About Us](https://www.givesendgo.com/site/about_us) page, the platform was founded by siblings [Heather and Jacob Wells.](https://www.givesendgo.com/site/press) [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Heather and Jacob Wells own the platform. It operates on a donation-based model; additionally, there is a standard processing
[fee for each donation,](https://www.givesendgo.com/Pricing-and-Fees) which is 2.9% + $0.30 for all transactions. The platform also offers a unique “Prayer Feature,” allowing people to send prayers along with their monetary donations.
Analysis / Bias
GiveSendGo primarily serves as a crowdfunding platform but also features a
[blog section](https://www.givesendgo.com/blogs?category=GiveSendGo%20News) where they post news and updates related to the platform and its campaigns. The blog post, “ [GiveSendGo Is Not a Political Pawn. It’s Time We Told Our Story,”](https://www.givesendgo.com/blog/Political_Pawn?title=GiveSendGo%20Is%20Not%20a%20Political%20Pawn.%20It%27s%20Time%20We%20Told%20Our%20Story.) claims that a higher, God-driven purpose guides their platform. However, the platform has been used to raise funds for individuals involved in political controversies, which raises questions about the platform’s stated non-political, faith-based mission. Including campaigns for politically controversial figures suggests a tension between the platform’s claimed religious focus and its actions, which have clear political implications.
For example, the platform has hosted fundraisers for individuals and causes that are politically controversial or extremist in nature. An article from
[Winnipeg Free Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/winnipeg-free-press/), titled [ “Ottawa convoy passes collection plate,”](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/faith/2022/02/08/ottawa-convoy-passes-collection-plate) discusses how GiveSendGo has become a significant source for right-wing fundraising.
One of the top trending fundraisers on the site is for the legal defense of former Trump lawyer
[John Eastman,](https://www.givesendgo.com/Eastman) who wrote a controversial memo about how Trump could retain power after losing the election. Another notable campaign was for [Kyle Rittenhouse](https://www.givesendgo.com/kylerittenhouse), who was accused of shooting and killing two people during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin. According to an article from [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/givesendgo-crowdfunding-extremism/), GiveSendGo has been criticized for allowing campaigns that support extremist ideologies and actions, including those related to the January 6 Capitol riot.
Finally, they raise funds for individuals who claim to be injured by the COVID-19 vaccine, such as this
[Severely Vaccine Injured](https://www.givesendgo.com/GAH18). While this person’s claims may or may not be true, there is no evidence provided to indicate she was legitimately injured by the vaccine. Therefore, one cannot tell if this is a scam or not.
This indicates that the platform hosts campaigns that lean towards a particular political ideology, often right-leaning or extremist. The factual accuracy of the blog posts is mixed, as they are primarily opinion-based and lack comprehensive sourcing.
