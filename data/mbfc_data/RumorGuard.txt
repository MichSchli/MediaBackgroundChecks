Analysis / Bias
RumorGuard.org claims to be a nonpartisan fact-checking organization that strives to be objective and impartial in its reporting. The website uses a rigorous
[methodology](https://www.rumorguard.org/our-process) to assess the accuracy of claims, and it provides clear and concise explanations of its findings. They rely on five primary criteria for fact-checking: Authenticity, Source, Evidence, Context, and Reasoning.
Rumorguard.org primarily fact-checks conspiracy theories and viral rumors. Headlines sometimes use loaded emotional wording such as this
[Climate change denialists push doctored video of TV weather map](https://www.rumorguard.org/post/climate-change-denialists-push-doctored-video-of-tv-weather-map). The use of the word “denialist” may be seen as a way to frame climate change skeptics negatively. In this fact check, they apply their methodology as follows:
- Authentic: No (Fake Clip)
- Source: No (No credible sources reported this)
- Evidence: No (The video clip was altered)
- Reasoning: No (The overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity has caused the Earth’s temperature to warm in ways that pose serious threats to humanity.)
In general, RumorGuard is a credible fact-checker with a solid methodology. While there is bias present against those who spread conspiracy theories and oppose the consensus of science, there is little political bias demonstrated as they fact-check both left and right politicians.
