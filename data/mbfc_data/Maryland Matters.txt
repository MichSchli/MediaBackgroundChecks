Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, Maryland Matters is part of
[States Newsroom](https://statesnewsroom.com/about/), a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit [supported by grants and a coalition of donors and readers](https://statesnewsroom.com/support/). States Newsroom publishes 28 other [publications](https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/). Maryland Matters is transparent as they link to the States Newsroom donors page. Initially, when they launched, they got fiscal sponsorship from the Hopewell Foundation; however, once the IRS approved their application for 501(c)(3) charity certification, they severed their ties with Hopewell Foundation. There has been criticism of their involvement with [the Hopewell Foundation,](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/mysterious-funders-behind-new-arizona-media-outlet-10870282) and they have responded to the criticism [here](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/a-few-friday-thoughts-on-what-the-arizona-mirror-is-and-isnt/).
Analysis / Bias
Maryland Matters publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Maryland. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects Marylanders. Articles and headlines sometimes promote liberal perspectives through minimal, loaded language
[Dems take two more Senate seats, win Frederick County exec race](https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/11/18/dems-take-two-more-senate-seats-win-frederick-county-exec-race/).
They properly source, linking to credible sources such as
[whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), and bls.gov (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Editorially, opinion pieces moderately favor the left, such as this
[Don Mohler: Advice to beleaguered Democrats as the campaign ticks down to its final days](https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/10/22/don-mohler-advice-to-beleaguered-democrats-as-the-campaign-ticks-down-to-its-final-days/). On the issues, Maryland Matters promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change. Finally, they occasionally report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [Trump ‘chose not to act’ as U.S. Capitol underwent attack, Jan. 6 panel says](https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/07/21/trump-chose-not-to-act-as-u-s-capitol-underwent-attack-jan-6-panel-says/). Maryland Matters generally reports news factually; however, story selection and op-eds moderately favor a liberal perspective.
