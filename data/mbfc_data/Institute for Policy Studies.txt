Analysis / Bias
An analysis from
[The Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/) described IPS as, “an avowedly radical organization.” In review, the Institute for Policy Studies publishes articles that favor the left or is negative toward the right. They utilize [emotionally loaded words](http://www.ips-dc.org/trumps-tax-reform-is-more-regressive-than-even-reagans/) in headlines and articles while using mostly left-leaning sources for information. The Institute for Policy Studies is usually factual in reporting, but they do tend to spin some information that can be misleading. In general, most articles reference facts and strongly lean left editorially, but the lack of transparency renders them Mostly Factual at best.
