Analysis / Bias
In review, Buzzsaw Politics appropriately labels their stories either commentary or opinion. Most stories are written from a conservative perspective on a known news story from a variety of sources. Story selection almost always favors the right and in particular President Donald Trump, while denigrating Democrats such as this:
[Opinion: Pelosi Impeached Trump Over Withholding Aid. Now She’s Withholding Aid To Us.](https://buzzsawpolitics.com/opinion-pelosi-impeached-trump/) and this [Trump’s In The ‘Catch 22’ Of A Lifetime. If He Succeeds, Put Him On Mount Rushmore.](https://buzzsawpolitics.com/trumps-in-the-catch-22/) When it comes to sourcing information, many articles do not link to outside information, while other link to credible sources such as the [CDC](https://buzzsawpolitics.com/trumps-in-the-catch-22/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). In some cases they utilize questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), which has a very poor track record with fact checkers. In general, Buzzsaw Politics presents factual news and commentary with a strong right leaning bias.
