History
Founded in 1986 by Newspaper Publishing, The Independent is a daily newspaper from London, United Kingdom. The Independent was
[launched](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-independent-reflections-on-the-last-20-years-418944.html) by former [Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/) staffers Andreas Whittam Smith, Matthew Symonds, and Stephen Glover. In 1990, The Independent on Sunday was launched and edited by Stephen Glover. In 1994, the founders left the paper, and Ian Hargreaves became the paper’s editor. A year later, Newspaper Publishing was restructured, with Mirror Group and [Tony O’Reilly’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_O%27Reilly) Independent News & Media (INM) becoming joint owners of Newspaper Publishing.
In 1998, INM took complete control of The Independent.
[O’Reilly](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/30-years-indy-founded-1986-print-peak-1989-victim-times-price-war-turning-tabloid-going-online-only/) bought out the company for £30m, and in 2010 and then Russian billionaire [Alexander Lebedev](https://www.forbes.com/profile/alexander-lebedev/#1283cad81f53) and his son Evgeny Lebedev [acquired](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/independent-print-limited-acquires-independent-titles-and-appoints-editor-1961291.html) The Independent. In 2016, the paper moved to a digital-only format. Simon Kelner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Independent titles. Andreas Whittam Smith, the Independent’s founder, has also joined the board of Independent Print Limited. In 2017, Saudi Businessman [Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40762906) bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper.

Analysis / Bias
The Independent recently joined a media group with close links to the Saudi royal family to launch websites across the Middle East. The Guardian has criticized its partnering with a publisher with strong ties to the Saudi government.
The Independent tends to publish stories utilizing minimally loaded language in their headlines such as:
[“Theresa May insists Brexit deal is not dead despite EU leaders refusing to make further concessions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-brexit-deal-vote-eu-council-summit-jean-claude-juncker-brussels-latest-a8683461.html)” and US news “ [Mueller investigation: Special counsel attacks. Flynn criticism of FBI interview](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mueller-investigation-michael-flynn-trump-fbi-interview-latest-update-agent-a8684401.html).” The Independent also republishes news from other credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/): [“Five things you didn’t know about Germany’s diesel ban.”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/germany-diesel-ban-what-cities-petrol-cars-air-pollution-emissions-a8230861.html) Most stories [favor the left](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/etias-brexit-visa-waiver-eu-uk-travel-holidays-europe-no-deal-third-country-a8683826.html) and tend to be appropriately sourced utilizing credible sources such as [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/) and the [Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/milwaukee-journal-sentinel/)
According to a 2017 survey conducted by
[You Gov UK](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/03/07/how-left-or-right-wing-are-uks-newspapers), The Independent has a center-left bias in reporting, with 79% saying it was either Center or Left and only 21% saying it leaned right. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 47% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 17% do not, ranking them #8 in trust of the major UK news providers. In general, The Independent holds a left-leaning editorial bias. Further, they produce a high content volume; therefore, the number of failed fact checks is low compared to the number of stories published. Consequently, they are classified as factually Mixed rather than questionable.
