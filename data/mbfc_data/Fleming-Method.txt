History
The Fleming-Method website is associated with
[Dr. Richard M. Fleming](https://www.flemingmethod.com/about), who holds multiple degrees (PhD, MD, JD). The website primarily focuses on health-related topics, with a strong emphasis on COVID-19, its treatment, and related vaccine analysis. It includes sections on the use of the Fleming Method for studying COVID-19 infection severity and treatment responses, as well as investigations into the effects of various COVID-19 vaccines.

Analysis / Bias
[The Fleming Method](https://www.flemingmethod.com/sars-cov-2-covid-19) is a technique developed by Dr. Richard M. Fleming for measuring changes in tissue to identify infection and inflammation/blood clotting, particularly in the context of COVID-19. This method involves the analysis of metabolic and regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) in tissue. Dr. Fleming has used it to study over 1800 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, claiming to assess the severity of their COVID-19 disease and their responses to various treatments, including controversial ones like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
The Fleming-Method website exhibits a clear bias towards unconventional and scientifically unsupported views on COVID-19 and vaccines. For example:
- COVID-19 Treatment Claims: The site claims to use the Fleming Method to study COVID-19 treatment responses, including controversial treatments like
[hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin](https://www.flemingmethod.com/sars-cov-2-covid-19), and reports varying degrees of success. Randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that [hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-no-new-revelation-on-hydroxychloroquine-and-covid-19/)in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
- Bioweapon Theory: The website entertains the possibility of
[COVID-19 being a bioweapon](https://www.flemingmethod.com/is-covid-19-a-bioweapon)and suggests that Dr. Fleming possesses evidence to support this theory, which is a claim [not supported by mainstream scientific consensus](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-dont-alter-dna-arent-subjected-to-federal-regulation-bioweapons-david-martin/).
- Vaccine Analysis: The site conducts its own investigation into the Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen vaccines, claiming to find harmful effects on human blood and even suggests the presence of substances like
[graphene oxide](https://www.flemingmethod.com/the-vaccines-rbcs-myth-vs-fact), which is a [claim not corroborated](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-grapheneoxide-vaccine/fact-check-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-contain-graphene-oxide-idUSL1N2OZ14F/)by any significant scientific research or regulatory body.
In general, the Fleming-Method website promotes disinformation related to COVID-19 and its associated vaccines. Furthermore, as of 2023, Dr. Fleming is still barred from working with anyone associated with the FDA:
