Analysis / Bias
The Herald/Review Media publishes local news through the use of local journalists. Local news uses minimally loaded wording like this
[Young load car diver sentenced gets 30 days in juvenile detention](https://www.myheraldreview.com/news/border/young-load-car-diver-sentenced-gets-30-days-in-juvenile-detention/article_80f5ab18-bf4a-11ec-9879-f38a45576cc4.html). The website does not cover national news.
Editorially, the Herald/Review Media leans right in its views as more op-eds slightly favor the right. The news is generally reported factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
