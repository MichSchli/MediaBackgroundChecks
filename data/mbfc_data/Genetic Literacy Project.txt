History
Founded in 2012 by
[Jon Entine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Entine), the Genetic Literacy Project is a non-profit that promotes public awareness and discussion of genetics, biotechnology, evolution, and science literacy. According to The Genetic Literacy Project (GLP), [the goal](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/mission-financials-governorship/), “through our website and outreach efforts, including the dissemination of educational materials, organizing public and private conferences and initiating briefings with regulators and government officials, is to prevent legislative overreach grounded in ideology rather than science, help in the creation of reasonable ethical and religious oversight of biotechnological innovation, and encourage cooperation among academic and industry researchers, all in an effort to promote the public interest..” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Genetic Literacy Project website publishes news and information on the fields of GMOs, genetics, evolution, and biotechnology. They publish original science reporting that is low biased and properly sourced, such as this
[How evolution could thwart the new COVID vaccines and what we can do to prevent that](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2020/11/25/how-evolution-could-thwart-the-new-covid-vaccines-and-what-we-can-do-to-prevent-that/). They also aggregate news related to their fields from sources such as the American Society for Microbiology and the [American Council on Science and Health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-council-on-science-and-health/).
Further, they publish commentary-based information related to science such as this, criticizing Mike Adams from the
[Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) pseudoscience network [Mike Adams: Natural News, “everyone’s favorite über-quack #1 anti-science website”—”even the quacks think he’s a quack](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/mike-adams-natural-news-everyones-favorite-uber-quack-1-anti-science-website/).” Finally, the website is pro-GMO with an [Anti-GMO Advocacy Funding Tracker](https://anti-gmo-advocacy-funding-tracker.geneticliteracyproject.org/) that shows who and how much money is spent to advocate against GMOs. According to the [Media Bias Fact Check Pseudoscience Dictionary](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), GMOs are proven to be safe, and those who are promoting these dangers are promoting pseudoscience. In general, this is a pro-science organization.
