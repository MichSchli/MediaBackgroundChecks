Analysis / Bias
In review, Queerty primarily covers lifestyle and entertainment news; however, they also cover politics with a strong left-leaning bias. There is significant use of loaded language, and almost all stories favor the left. An example story is this:
[These hilarious memes prove Donald Trump is definitely the most “stable genius](https://www.queerty.com/hilarious-memes-prove-donald-trump-definitely-stable-genius-20180108).”
In 2021/2022, they continue to favor the left with stories such as this
[Jewish Republican who hates gay people and takes money from Nazi enthusiasts announces Senate run](https://www.queerty.com/jewish-republican-hates-gay-people-takes-money-nazi-enthusiasts-announces-senate-run-20210210). They generally report the news factually and with a left-leaning bias as they always have.
