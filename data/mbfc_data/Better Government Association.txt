History
Founded in 1923, the
[Better Government Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Government_Association) is a Chicago-based investigative journalism non-profit organization. The Better Government Association’s mission is to work for “integrity, transparency, and accountability in government by exposing corruption and inefficiency; identifying and advocating effective public policy; and engaging and mobilizing the electorate to achieve authentic and responsible reform.”
The BGA and the Center on Wrongful Convictions won the Edward R. Murrow Award for the June 2011 investigation into the high cost of wrongful convictions. This was a groundbreaking series documenting the human and financial toll of alleged government and police misconduct that led to 85 people being wrongfully incarcerated for violent crimes they did not commit.
