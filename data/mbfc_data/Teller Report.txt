Analysis / Bias
Teller Report republishes articles from various sources, including those that may have different levels of factual reporting and bias. For example, it republished an article from RT News titled
[The US Department of Justice announced the arrest of Russian Marchenko on suspicion of circumventing sanctions](https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2023-09-18-the-us-department-of-justice-announced-the-arrest-of-russian-marchenko-on-suspicion-of-circumventing-sanctions.r1lu1vV8y6.html). RT News is a questionable Russian propaganda news outlet.
Lastly, Teller Report republishes articles from sources like
[Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/), which has a [factually mixed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/) rating, as well as credible sources like [France24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/). In general, Teller Report republishes news from a wide variety of sources, some of which may not always be factual. Further, its complete lack of transparency lowers its credibility level.
Failed Fact Checks
