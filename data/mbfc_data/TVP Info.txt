Analysis / Bias
The article
[“Censorship on the Platform’s website – they created a list of forbidden words“](https://www.tvp.info/72540763/wybory-2023-cenzura-na-stronie-platformy-stworzyli-liste-slow-zakazanych) discusses a list of banned words on a website aimed at the Law and Justice Party (PiS). The website is likely part of the electoral campaign of the Civic Platform party. The article uses strong language and seems to criticize the Civic Platform for censorship, calling it “the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”The article cites a [Twitter user](https://twitter.com/an_te_k?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1699461271932870930%7Ctwgr%5Ea13e6019e49ca6d3c3d36ee1e3fa5a4057852474%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.tvp.pl%2Fobject%2Fnew%2F33%2Fparent%2F72540763) as its source, raising questions about the information’s credibility.

The article does not cite external sources but relies on TVP Info’s own reporting and Poland’s national news agency, The Polish Press Agency (PAP)
Both articles lean right; the first one criticizes the center-right
[Civic Platform (PO)](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/whats-stake-polands-parliamentary-election-2023-08-28/) of former European Council President Donald Tusk, while the second portrays Right-Wing Populist Nationalist [President Duda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poland-media-profile/#google_vignette) in a positive light.
