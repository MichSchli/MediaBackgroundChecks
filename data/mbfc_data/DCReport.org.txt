Analysis / Bias
In review, The DCReport has a left-center bias in reporting choices and occasionally uses loaded words in the headlines such as this:
[Trump Fiddles As The World Burns â€¦ And Drowns, Dries And Dies.](https://www.dcreport.org/2018/10/10/trump-fiddles-as-the-world-burns/) This website has a clear anti-Trump bias but sources all information correctly. On the whole, most stories on this website favor the left, but not overtly.
