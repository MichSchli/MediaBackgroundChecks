Analysis / Bias
In review, the
[Eurasia Group](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/our-story) is a “firm devoted exclusively to helping investors and business decision-makers understand the impact of politics on risks and opportunities in foreign markets.” The website describes what they do, such as [political risk consultancy](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/services/political-risk-advisory). News is also reported, such as this [EURASIA GROUP’S TOP RISKS FOR 2023.](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2023) This report is very well-sourced and balanced. In fact, most reporting on this website is evidence-based in their predictions.
They also offer commentary that is not always favorable to the former Trump administration, such as this:
[Why President Trump’s effort to expand the G-7 is doomed to fail](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/president-trump-effort-expand-g-7-doomed-to-fail). This story was republished from the left-leaning [Time Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/). Some other sources they republish from are [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), and [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/), which all lean left by our methodology. In general, story selection and editorial positions slightly favor the left.
