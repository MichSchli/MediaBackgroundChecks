Unfortunately, their [about page](http://memepoliceman.com/welcome/) is limited in information. The domain is registered in the USA.

Analysis / Bias
At the time of this review in January 2023, the Meme Policeman is inactive, but the site still lives with archival information. In the past, MP did an excellent job of deconstructing memes from the left and the right. The articles are factual, well-sourced, and well-written. There is a slight overall right bias both in tone and in the conclusions drawn from the source data, but the factual, well-sourced articles and overall quality of the reporting far outweigh the mild bias and earn MP a rating of Least Biased. They generally favor a libertarian perspective but keep their bias in check.
