Analysis / Bias
The tone of the website is distinctly conservative and faith-based, advocating for policies that align with these values while strongly opposing differing viewpoints. For example, The article
[“Gay Street Party is LGBTAOK, But Australia Day Parade in Doubt](https://blog.canberradeclaration.org.au/2022/08/05/gay-street-party-is-lgbtaok/), criticizes the government’s decision to hold a gay street party. It uses phrases like “The double standard applied by the Labor government is breathtaking” and refers to Victoria as “Danistan,” a likely derogatory play on Premier Daniel Andrews’ name.
The piece also employs mocking language such as “Woohoo! Monkey-covid for everyone!” and ”Everything is LGBTAOK in the Republic of Danistan.”While it cites statements from the Premier’s office (his tweet) and an LGBTQ health advocate, it lacks external source links. Overall, the article displays a strong bias against the government’s decision to hold a gay street party, using emotionally loaded language and mocking tones to make its point.
Further, they promote misinformation regarding COVID-19 and vaccines, such as:
[“Moderna Booster Caused Silent Heart Injury for 1 in 35 Recipients: Study.”](https://blog.canberradeclaration.org.au/2023/07/31/moderna-booster-heart-injury-1-in-35/) While they source a credible study published in the [European Journal of Heart Failure](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejhf.2978), they [misrepresent the findings](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/swiss-study-doesnt-show-moderna-mrna-vaccines-dangerous-heart-john-campbell-the-gateway-pundit-exaggerated-study-conclusions/) of the study. In addition, the article [“The Global Glory of Jesus Christ Will Cover the Earth”](https://blog.canberradeclaration.org.au/2020/09/03/the-global-glory-of-jesus-christ-will-cover-the-earth/) by Rodney Rivers discusses visions and dreams predicting a global spiritual revival. The claims are based on personal religious experiences and lack empirical evidence, making the article pseudoscientific in nature.
