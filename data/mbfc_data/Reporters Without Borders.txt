Analysis / Bias
The RWB website contains information on the number of journalists killed, the predators of press freedom such as Vladimir Putin, and a map that shows press freedom by country. Reporters Without Borders also reports news that is related to the above topics. Although Reporters Without Borders is
[not fond of former President Trump](https://rsf.org/en/news/us-weeklyaddress-august-14-20-trump-criticizes-fake-news-coverage-charlottesville-protests) and his attacks on credible media, there is little bias in their reports. Multiple reviews and daily use of their website by our reviewers have proven valuable and accurate for MBFC. For this reason, we rate them Least Biased and High for factual reporting.
