Analysis / Bias
In review, SourceWatch reports on the funding, spending, and political orientation of corporations, interest groups and lobby organizations. They typically focus on right-leaning conservative groups, especially those connected to
[Koch Industries](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Koch_Brothers). While SourceWatch does not use loaded wording, they do consistently favor the left. According to the right-leaning [Influence Watch](https://www.influencewatch.org/organization/sourcewatch/) “SourceWatch is a project of the liberal non-profit Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). The purpose of the website from its inception has been to track conservative individuals and organizations in order to serve SourceWatch’s liberal political agenda.” A review of SourceWatch reveals that statement to be mostly accurate. While [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/) is clearly opposing SourceWatch, they are accurate in refuting them. Is SourceWatch credible? Yes, but they are one-sided in their reports, and this bias must be considered.
