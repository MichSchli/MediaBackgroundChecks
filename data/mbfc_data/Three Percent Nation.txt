Analysis / Bias
Three Percent Nation publishes news from a conservative perspective that often features emotionally loaded language such as this
[SATAN LOVING DEVIL WORSHIPPERS TRIED HIJACKING A CHRISTMAS DISPLAY, THEN SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL HAPPENED…](https://threepercenternation.com/2023/12/08/satan-loving-devil-worshippers-tried-hijacking-a-christmas-display-then-something-absolutely-wonderful-happened/) and [TRUMP JUST REVEALED ANOTHER SICK TRICK THE MSM IS USING AGAINST HIM….](https://threepercenternation.com/2023/12/06/trump-just-revealed-another-sick-trick-the-msm-is-using-against-him/) This last story is sourced from Donald Trump’s Truth Social account and [Clay Travis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/clay-travis-bias-rating/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and frequently denigrate the left like this:
[LIZ CHENEY IS ABOUT TO MAKE THE MOST SICKENING MOVE POSSIBLE AT DONALD TRUMP….](https://threepercenternation.com/2023/12/07/liz-cheney-is-about-to-make-the-most-sickening-move-possible-at-donald-trump/) and [THE LEFT’S LATEST ATTEMPT AT A SICKENING GUN GRAB IS TOTALLY HAM FISTED….](https://threepercenternation.com/2023/12/04/the-lefts-latest-attempt-at-a-sickening-gun-grab-is-totally-ham-fisted/) In general, this a source that lacks credibility through the promotion of right-wing propaganda, conspiracies, and a complete lack of transparency.
