Analysis / Bias
[The Kurdistan Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Region) is an autonomous region in Northern Iraq. This Region is divided into four governorates: Duhok, Erbil, Sulaymaniya, and Halabja. Erbil is the Capital city. The Kurdistan Region has a presidential system with the current president Nechirvan Barzani. The [KDP](https://www.kdp.info/p/p.aspx?p=1&l=12&s=010000&r=344) is one of the main Kurdish parties in Iraq and is described as a tribal (Note tribes are KDP-Barzanis and the PUK-Talabani’s), considered the [leftist nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Democratic_Party) big tent party.
In review, Basnews is
[left-leaning](https://cpj.org/2015/07/turkish-authorities-block-access-to-news-websites.php) and believed to be [affiliated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28211544) with the KDP in Erbil. When reporting regional news, Basnews utilizes headlines with emotionally loaded language such as [“PUK Leadership, Talabani Family in War of Words”](http://www.basnews.com/en/babat/417933) however, this article is poorly sourced with only quotes. Usually, Basnews publishes short news stories, and they rarely use hyperlinks. For example, they use the Turkish news agency [Anadolu](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anadolu-agency/). However, they do not provide a hyperlink: [“Iraq’s Judiciary Asks Parliament to Lift Immunity of 28 MPs”](http://www.basnews.com/en/babat/603745). In general, story selection favors a leftist perspective and is poorly sourced.
