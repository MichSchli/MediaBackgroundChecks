Analysis / Bias
In review, the Socialist Standard covers news and events through a Marxist perspective with articles such as this:
[EDITORIAL: WORKING CLASS LIVES MATTER](https://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2020/2020s/no-1391-july-2020/editorial-working-class-lives-matter/). This opinion piece is not sourced at all. In another story, [THE CASE FOR SOCIALISM](https://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2020/2020s/no-1391-july-2020/the-case-for-socialism-5/), there is again zero sourcing of information. A review of numerous articles shows a complete lack of hyperlinked sourcing to outside verifiable sources. In general, this is a strongly left-leaning source opposed to capitalism and does not source information properly.
