Analysis / Bias
In review, the Black News Channel (BNC) publishes news, sports, politics, and entertainment news. Articles often focus on the successes and issues of the black and brown communities. Articles and headlines sometimes contain emotionally loaded language, such as this
[Corporate America Failed to Deliver Two Years After George Floyd’s Death](https://bnc.tv/corporate-america-failed-commitment-two-years-george-floyd-death/). News and information are usually properly sourced from credible media outlets such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) and [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/).
Editorially, BNC labels opinion pieces as OP-ED in the headlines. Op-eds favor a liberal perspective with concern for issues such as social justice, civil rights, and race, such as this
[Black Mississippi Senators ‘Protest’ Vote to Ban Critical Race Theory](https://bnc.tv/every-black-mississippi-senator-walked-out-protest-ban-critical-race-theory-education/). They also report negatively on conservatives and former President Trump, such as this [Trump Pushes Conspiracy Theory About Buffalo Protester](https://bnc.tv/trump-pushes-conspiracy-theory-about-buffalo-protester/). This story comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). In general, BNC reports news factually and with a moderate left-leaning bias.
