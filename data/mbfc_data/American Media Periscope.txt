Analysis / Bias
In review, the “
[MAKING SENSE OF THE MADNESS](https://americanmediaperiscope.com/making-sense-of-the-madness/)” section on American Media Periscope features a series of episodes that discuss various topics, often challenging mainstream narratives. One such episode features Dr. Rima Laibow discussing the United Nations and “The Great Narrative: [“Rima Laibow Destroys The Great Narrative | MSOM Ep. 818.“](https://americanmediaperiscope.com/msom-ep-818/) Dr. Rima Laibow, a trustee of [Natural Solutions Foundation,](http://drrimatruthreports.com/) was involved in controversies over marketing a colloidal silver product as a COVID-19 treatment without [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/natural-solutions-foundation-605748-05192020) approval. The Foundation settled a federal lawsuit, and a [permanent injunction](https://patch.com/new-jersey/hopatcong-sparta/federal-suit-settled-nj-company-claiming-covid-treatment) was issued against them, preventing the marketing of the product without FDA oversight.
Further, in a
[Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) article, [Dr. Rima Laibow](https://www.newsweek.com/natural-solutions-foundation-ordered-stop-selling-fake-nano-silver-covid-treatment-1663757) and the Natural Solutions Foundation referred to the FDA as a “Deep State agency.” They were ordered by a federal court to stop selling a “nanosilver” COVID-19 treatment, claiming that agencies like the FDA target “health freedom advocates.” In summary, Dr. Rima Laibow is a controversial figure. While she engages in discussions that challenge mainstream viewpoints, her history of [legal controversies](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/district-court-orders-new-jersey-defendants-stop-distributing-unapproved-nano-silver-products) related to health claims adds a dimension of scrutiny to her credibility.
Furthermore, Michael Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former
[Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) national security adviser, has a controversial history, including a guilty plea for lying to the FBI and a subsequent pardon. Described by [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) as blending [“deranged political ideas”](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/michael-flynn-maga-christian-trump/671852/) with religious beliefs, Flynn is a key figure in the “ReAwaken America” events. American Media Periscope’s partnership with Flynn’s tour suggests a far-right ideological alignment for the media outlet. Finally, they have promoted QAnon-related conspiracies, such as claiming the military has [installed Trump back as President](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2840902336225871).
In general, American Media Periscope is a far-right source that has promoted conspiracy theories and pseudoscience, as evidenced by the above and failed fact checks below.
