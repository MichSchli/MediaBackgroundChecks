[about page](https://verlag.faz.net/unternehmen/ueber-uns/portraet/portraet-der-f-a-z-wissen-fuer-kluge-koepfe-11090906.html), The FAZ describes itself as “a liberal-conservative voice in business, politics, and culture.” The paper leans center-right and traditionally supports [Christian Democrats.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100348/https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Political%20Parallelism%20and%20Media%20Coalitions.pdf)
In review, The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) publishes articles with minimally emotionally loaded language such as
[“SPD boss insists on taking over old debts of the municipalities.”](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/walter-borjans-spd-chef-pocht-auf-uebernahme-von-altschulden-der-kommunen-16959122.html) Editorially, they tend to be critical of SPD (social democrats) while favoring the CDU, [“Why even politicians in the same party do not always agree.”](https://www.faz.net/podcasts/wie-erklaere-ich-s-meinem-kind/kindern-erklaert-wieso-politiker-nicht-immer-einer-meinung-sind-17203929.html) They also report favorably on the far-right AfD [“Weidel wants to form a top AfD team with Chrupalla.”](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/afd-alice-weidel-will-mit-chrupalla-spitzenteam-fuer-bundestagswahl-bilden-17326426.html) On the issues, they are slightly critical of migrants, as seen in this story: [“Solidarity! Why?”](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/die-gegenwart/europe-solidarity-why-14085960.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2)
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) has its own correspondent network; therefore, the paper often hyperlinks to itself and quoting credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). When covering world news about the USA, they source through attribution to the American Media. For example, in this article titled [”Investigators search Rudy Giuliani’s residence,”](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/ukraine-affaere-wohnsitz-von-trumps-anwalt-rudy-giuliani-durchsucht-17317079.html) they source by stating, “According to the American media, had repeatedly been blocked by the Trump administration,” instead of providing hyperlinks to the media source. In general, they report fact-based news that holds a right-center editorial bias.
