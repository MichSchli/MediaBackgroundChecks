History
East Arizona News is a conservative news and opinion website published by
[Metric Media LLC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/metric-media/) that is designed to look like a local news source. Metric Media publishes over 1000 websites with the same design and about page that reads “Metric Media was established to fill the void in community news after years of decline in local reporting by legacy media. Our approach is to provide objective, data-driven information without political bias. We provide 100% original reporting, including to share as much data as possible from government and other publicly available sources.”
Metric Media LLC lacks transparency as they do not have an about page that describes their conservative agenda, nor discloses funding and ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
Although the Metric Media LLC website does not disclose ownership, each of their local news websites states on their about pages that they are owned by the
[Metric Media Foundation](https://www.metricmedia.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit news content provider. The CEO of Metric Media is conservative political consultant [Bradley Cameron](https://www.courthousenews.com/partisan-news-outlets-seek-to-fill-void-in-us-news-deserts/). The foundation is funded through donations and grants but lacks transparency as they do not disclose who their donors are. Metric Media LLC websites receive revenue through advertising and donations to the Metric Media Foundation. Based on the size and scope of this operation it is assumed that the Metric Media Foundation provides the majority of funding to Metric Media LLC for the production of their websites.
