History
Founded in 2020, Echo Check claims to be a fact-checker based on “Judeo-Christian principles.” According to their
[about page](https://echocheck.org/about/), “The primary mission of EchoCheck.org is to provide independent fact checks on stories whose intent appears to be to mislead or deceive in order to move people away from the Judeo-Christian principles and morals the United States of America was founded on.” In other words, if it does not align with the far-right, it will fail the fact-check.
Echo Check completely lacks transparency as they do not name owners, editors, or authors. This completely discredits them as a fact-checker.

Echo Check does not disclose ownership or funding sources, a red flag for a fact-checker.
Analysis / Bias
In reviewing their fact checks, Echo Check presents as a far-right propaganda imposter website designed to promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience under the guise of being a fact-checker. For example, they promote the debunked “Stolen Election” conspiracy with fact checks such as this
[Fact Check: Did Biden and the Democrats steal the 2020 Election?](https://echocheck.org/fact-check-did-biden-and-the-democrats-steal-the-2020-election/) Echo Check concludes with 100% Certainty Biden stole the election. They cite evidence from Rand Paul, an article from the conspiracy website [The Stream](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-stream/), [ConservativeHQ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-hq/), a [Rumble](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rumble/) Video, [Here is the Evidence](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/here-is-the-evidence/), the discredited [Navarro Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/navarro-report/), and finally [Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/). Essentially, they use false and debunked information to validate the claim.
Echo Check also promotes quackery level pseudoscience when it comes to covid-19. In this article, they promote
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/03/08/facebook-announces-plans-to-block-anti-vaccination-content/) with false information [Should you get the Covid Vaccine? Dr. Bhakdi – No](https://echocheck.org/should-you-get-the-covid-vaccine-dr-bhakdi-no/). Dr. Bhakdi is known as a [crackpot conspiracy theorist](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/04/fact-check-covid-shots-are-not-set-to-contribute-to-the-decimation-of-the-world's-population.html) who claims COVID Shots will “Decimate World Population.” The article also uses inferior sources who frequently promote disinformation, such as [America’s Frontline Doctors](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/americas-frontline-doctors/) and Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician (not an expert on infectious disease) who routinely makes [false claims](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/04/sherri-tenpenny/covid-19-vaccine-does-not-cause-death-autoimmune-d/) regarding Covid-19. In general, Echo Check completely lacks credibility based on extreme right-wing bias and the routine promotion of false information.
