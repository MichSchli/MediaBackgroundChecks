It is headquartered in Nederland. Nederlandse Omroep Stichting or NOS is responsible for coordinating the public service broadcasting system. The public broadcasting system in the Netherlands consists of three tv-channels and six radio stations nationwide and thirteen regional television and radio broadcasters. NOS has a special statutory obligation to make news and sports programs for the three Dutch public television channels and the Dutch public radio services. According to the [NOS](https://over.nos.nl/voor-de-pers/about-us) about page “It operates independently from the government, even though the Dutch public broadcasting system is partially funded by taxpayers’ money.” The Board of directors is Jan de Jong (CEO) and Geert Hofman (CFO).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Netherlands Radio and Television Association) utilizes minimally loaded language both in their headlines and articles such as “
[Trump starts trade war with the EU: levy on steel and aluminum](https://nos.nl/artikel/2234438-trump-begint-handelsoorlog-met-eu-heffing-op-staal-en-aluminium.html)” and national news [“’Shortages of antibiotics due to monopoly on raw materials.’”](https://nos.nl/artikel/2234405-tekorten-antibiotica-gevolg-van-monopolie-op-grondstoffen.html) NOS is always very well-sourced through [The Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau (ANP),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algemeen_Nederlands_Persbureau) which in the Netherlands, ANP represents the news agencies [Agence France-Presse (AFP)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA). They also use pro-science sources such as [KNMP.nl,](https://www.knmp.nl/) which is the Dutch Pharmacy Association.
While the wording of articles is generally neutral and sourced there is evidence that NOS supports or perhaps does not reject the right-wing anti-immigrant and nationalist positions of the PVV party headed by
[Geert Wilders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Wilders). For example, in this article [“Wilders wipes court in ‘less Moroccan’ case”](https://nos.nl/artikel/2232249-wilders-wraakt-gerechtshof-in-minder-marokkanen-zaak.html) NOS does not mention that Wilders and the PVV party are right-wing nationalists. Whereas coverage from the left-leaning [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/18/geert-wilders-netherlands-describes-immigrants-scum-holland) accurately identifies Wilders’s political affiliation as ‘far-right.” Further, NOS named Wilders the [Politician of 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071218193239/http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/artikelen/2007/12/15/151207_politicus2007.html).
