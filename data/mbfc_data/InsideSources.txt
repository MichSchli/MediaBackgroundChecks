Analysis / Bias
In review, InsideSources utilizes strong loaded words in both headlines and articles, such as “
[How the Trump Administration Is Siding With International Terrorists Over American Citizens.](http://www.insidesources.com/sokolow-trump-administration-siding-international-terrorists-american-citizens/)” However, they typically present both sides of political news, such as: “ [Deficits and Punitive Taxes: President Obama’s Latest Budget Looks a Lot Like His Past.](http://www.insidesources.com/deficits-and-punitive-taxes-president-obamas-latest-budget-looks-a-lot-like-his-past/)” InsideSources usually use credible sources to support their information, such as [Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Congress.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/congress-gov/).
In opinion pieces regarding economics and climate change, InsideSources has a right-leaning bias and utilizes sources such as the corporately funded
[American Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-enterprise-institute/), which does not always support the consensus of science regarding climate change. Some authors regularly downplay [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and its impacts, such as this [Consider Polar Bears: Cute, Iconic — and Surprisingly Abundant](https://www.insidesources.com/consider-polar-bears-cute-iconic-and-surprisingly-abundant/). This story does not align with the [consensus](https://www.insidesources.com/consider-polar-bears-cute-iconic-and-surprisingly-abundant/) that Polar Bears are threatened by Sea Ice loss.
