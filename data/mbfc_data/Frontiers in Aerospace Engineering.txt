Analysis / Bias
In review, Frontiers in Aerospace Engineering is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to aviation engineering. The journal primarily publishes research such as this
[Efficacy of an Elasto-Flexible Morphing Wing at High Lift Using Fluid-Structure-Interaction Simulations](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpace.2022.975600/abstract).
[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
In general, Frontiers in Aerospace Engineering is a credible scientific journal, as we cannot find any controversy or significant retractions to date. However, Frontiers Media has
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
