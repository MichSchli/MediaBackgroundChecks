Analysis / Bias
The Raging Patriot does not produce original news and commentary; instead, they republish or summarize articles from other sources. In reviewing their articles, a pattern emerged demonstrating that they plagiarize the work of others without giving proper hyperlink credit. For example, in this article, they change the headline of a Trending Politics story to be highly emotional
[BOMBSHELL: Georgia Has Just Announced An Investigation Into Suspected Election Fraud In 2020; And The Left-Wing Activists Have A Lot To Answer For](https://theragingpatriot.org/2022/01/05/bombshell-georgia-has-just-announced-an-investigation-into-suspected-election-fraud-in-2020-and-the-left-wing-activists-have-a-lot-to-answer-for/). The Trending Politics title is less emotional [Georgia Announces New Investigation Into Suspected 2020 Election Fraud Involving Over 200 Left-wing Activists](https://trendingpolitics.com/georgia-announces-new-investigation-into-suspected-2020-election-fraud-involving-over-200-left-wing-activists-knab/). Unless The Raging Patriot has an arranged deal with Trending Politics, this will constitute copyright infringement.
We found other instances of blatant plagiarism, such as this article that is copied near-verbatim without credit from the Associated Press
[FAUCI IS A CLOWN: Dr. Fauci says it’s safe for children to trick-or-treat this year WHEN NO ONE REALLY ASKED](https://theragingpatriot.org/2021/10/13/fauci-is-a-clown-dr-fauci-says-its-safe-for-children-to-trick-or-treat-this-year-when-no-one-really-asked/). For comparison, the headline of the [AP article](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) is not sensationalized [The Latest: Fauci says fine to trick-or-treat this year](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-lifestyle-halloween-anthony-fauci-3da202cddb73d58facb2acb59d8fed0e).
Editorially all stories favor the right and frequently
[denigrate Democrats](https://theragingpatriot.org/2021/08/07/watch-ron-desantis-hilariously-roasts-biden-for-lack-of-leadership/) such as this mocking Joe Biden for alleged dementia with this quote “Gov. Desantis responded to this with another hilarious roast about Biden’s visible dementia traits.” Further, the sources they plagiarize from are often questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Trending Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trending-politics/), the [Conservative Brief](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-brief-bias/), and [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). Finally, they also promote misinformation regarding [election fraud in the 2020 election](https://theragingpatriot.org/2021/08/14/breaking-dominion-files-lawsuit-against-newsmax-oan-after-they-unveil-truth-about-2020-election-fraud/) and with [Covid-19](https://theragingpatriot.org/2021/07/29/pelosi-to-capitol-police-arrest-maskless-visitors-and-staffers/). In general, The Raging Patriot holds extreme right biases and sycophantic admiration for former President Trump.
