Analysis / Bias
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Saudi Arabia 170/180 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/saudi-arabia) stating that “Saudi Arabia permits no independent media. The authorities keep Saudi journalists under close surveillance, even when they are abroad, as Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in Istanbul in October 2018 illustrated.” [Read our profile on Saudi Arabia’s Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/saudi-arabia-media-profile/)
In review, Arab News publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as
[“Governor of Saudi Arabia’s Jouf province praises efforts to provide housing during virus outbreak.”](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1684521/saudi-arabia) Arab News reports single-sided news information dedicated to praising the Royal family and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s achievements such as this: [“When a Saudi went to space”](https://feature.arabnews.com/prince-sultan-in-space/) and [“UN envoy congratulates Saudi Arabia for brokering Yemen peace deal](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1580871/saudi-arabia).” Under the section “Deep Dive,” there is a subsection called “preachers of hate” dedicated to exposing extremist anti-Muslim activists worldwide. One of them is [“Pamela Geller,”](https://www.preachersofhate.com/) who we have rated as [questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geller-report/) due to promoting anti-Islamic propaganda.
On issues such as women’s rights, Arab News report with a pro-reform stance. For example, they have a page dedicated to women called
[“Faces of Saudi.”](http://www.facesofsaudi.com/) When it comes to sourcing, Arab News poorly sources and does not provide hyperlinks, however when covering world news under the section [“Media,”](https://www.arabnews.com/main-category/media) they utilize credible sources such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) by republishing their articles.
While the news is generally reported factually, it is one-sided and always favorable to the government, especially Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. For example, regarding the Khashoggi murder, they continue to report that the Crown Prince is not involved despite
[evidence](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/saudi-sentences-five-to-death-three-to-jail-in-khashoggi-case.html) implicating him: [Khashoggi’s son denounces ‘enemies of Saudi Arabia’ for exploiting his father’s murder](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1562096/saudi-arabia). They also frequently report negatively and without evidence on rival countries such as Iran, [Iran ‘hides 500,000 virus cases,’ says member country’s anti-virus taskforce.](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1654676/middle-east) In general, this is a source that promotes pro-state propaganda.
