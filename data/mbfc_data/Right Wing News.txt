Analysis / Bias
In review, every headline and article on Right Wing News utilizes very strong loaded emotional language such as:
[Excellent: Trump Looking To Build More Jails For Illegals](http://rightwingnews.com/illegal-immigration-2/excellent-trump-looking-build-jails-illegals/). All articles favor the right in story selection and denigrate the left. In particular, this source likes to expose crimes and/or negative stories that relate to [people of color or Islam](http://rightwingnews.com/race/blm-spike-lee-colin-kaepernick-jointly-degenerate-total-farce/). Further, many articles use sources that are rated as Questionable or on the extreme end of right-wing. They also have a [Mostly False Claim](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-bans-military-uniforms/) by an [IFCN fact checker](https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles).
