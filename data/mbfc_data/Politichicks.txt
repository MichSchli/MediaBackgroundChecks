Analysis / Bias
In review, the website publishes information that is both original and summarizes existing news stories. Headlines and articles vary from low-biased to emotional such as this
[Insanity Is Alive And Catching](https://politichicks.com/2020/09/insanity-is-alive-and-catching/). Outside of a cartoon, this story completely lacks sourcing to verifiable sources. They also report opinion content that is completely without sourced information to support the claims of the headline [Very Possible: A Landslide Election For Donald Trump](https://politichicks.com/2020/09/very-possible-a-landslide-election-for-donald-trump/). While this argument is possible, it lacks any premise to support it., which is a fallacy in philosophical and critical thinking or a very poor biased argument.
As of this update in 2023, they continue to report with a conservative bias referencing sources such as the questionable
[Americas Freedom Fighters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-freedom-fighters/), [Clash Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/clash-daily/), and the [Conservative Firing Line](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-firing-line/). This source has lost credibility and is now considered Questionable and low factual.
