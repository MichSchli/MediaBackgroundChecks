History
[Founded in 2016](https://www.whois.com/whois/icandecide.org) by Del Bigtree, the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) is an Anti-vaccine organization that routinely promotes disinformation regarding the safety of vaccines. Del Bigtree also owns and publishes the Conspiracy-Pseudoscience website [The Highwire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-highwire/), which is the host website for his internet radio program. The website publishes [alternative health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) and medical news that frequently promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
Del Bigtree is an American television and film producer and CEO who produced the film
[Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaxxed:_From_Cover-Up_to_Catastrophe) based on the discredited views of [Andrew Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) on an alleged connection between [vaccines and autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/).

Funded by / Ownership
The Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Austin, Texas. Donations generate revenue. According to the
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), ICAN received millions of dollars in initial funding from the [Selz family](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/meet-the-new-york-couple-donating-millions-to-the-anti-vax-movement/2019/06/18/9d791bcc-8e28-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html). Further, [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) reports that [ICAN had a 60% increase in revenue](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/struggling-anti-vaccination-groups-enjoyed-pandemic-windfall-rcna14402) during the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020.
Analysis / Bias
ICAN states its mission: “Our goal is to put the power of scientifically researched health information in your hands and to be bold and transparent in doing so, thereby enabling your medical decisions to come from tangible understanding, not medical coercion.”
The website publishes ICAN’s lawsuits against government agencies, such as this
[ICAN v. CDC – CDC Cannot Support its Claim That “Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism.”](https://www.icandecide.org/ican-v-cdc-cdc-cannot-support-its-claim-that-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/) They also publish Freedom of Information Act information such as [FDA Communications with Merck About Gardasil Plant Inspection](https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FDA-Communications-with-Merck-About-Gardasil-Plant-Inspection.pdf). Further, they publish news related to ICAN, such as this [FDA Fails to Rebut Science Reflecting COVID-19 Vaccines Can Modify Recipient DNA](https://www.icandecide.org/fda-fails-to-rebut-science-reflecting-covid-19-vaccines-can-modify-recipient-dna/) and fact checks like this [Oxford Professor Melinda Mills’ Claims Regarding Measles & Measles Vaccine](https://www.icandecide.org/oxford-professor-melinda-mills-claims-regarding-measles-measles-vaccine/). Finally, they link to Del Bigtree’s pseudoscience website, [The Highwire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-highwire/).
Although ICAN and The Highwire claim to use scientifically researched information, they are often at odds with the consensus regarding the vaccine-autism connection and Covid-19. Further, they promote conspiracies concerning the government’s health agencies. See numerous false and misleading claims below.
In general, the Informed Consent Action Network is a quackery-level pseudoscience source that promotes disinformation regarding vaccines.
