Analysis / Bias
Bullshit News produces satirical news that mocks conservatives such as this
[Santa Claus Killed By The Intolerant Left](https://bullshitnews.org/2020/12/25/santa-claus-killed-by-the-intolerant-left/). While BSN does not openly state they are satire, we are hoping that a site called Bullshit News should be enough to clue you in. If you share their content as real news that is on you!
