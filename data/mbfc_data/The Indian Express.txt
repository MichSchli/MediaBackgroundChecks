Analysis / Bias
In review, The Indian Express publishes national news through reporters with moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Explained: Andhra surges in Coronavirus case load so does India](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-andhra-surges-in-coronavirus-case-load-so-does-india-6514747/). This story does not contain hyperlinked sourcing. International news is provided through [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/).
Editorially, The Indian Express reports on the Me Too movement, climate change and criticizes the right-leaning Modi government such as this
[Despite govt claims, migrants continue to be vulnerable and abandoned](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/migrant-workers-coronavirus-lockdown-job-opportunities-6513845/). In general, there is a slight left-leaning editorial bias, and the news is not always reported factually, as evidenced by failed fact checks.
