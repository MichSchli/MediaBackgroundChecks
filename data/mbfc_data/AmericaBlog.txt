History
AMERICAblog is a liberal American blog founded by John Aravosis in April 2004, with several co-bloggers. According to their
[about page](http://americablog.com/about-us), “AMERICAblog is a journal of news and opinion about US politics, both domestic and foreign, from a progressive point of view.” John Aravosis is the current editor-in-chief.
In 2011, Aravosis received a tip that British oil giant BP (British Petroleum) was posting falsified photos to its website during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He analyzed the photos, then
[published an article](http://americablog.com/2010/07/bp-photoshops-fake-photo-of-command.html) on AMERICAblog proving that the images were doctored electronically. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, AmericaBlog uses moderately strong loaded words and somewhat sensational headlines such as:
[From Russia with Poison](http://americablog.com/2018/03/from-russia-with-poison.html). Most information on the website is either sourced properly or quoted from other sources. Editorially, almost all stories favor the left, such as this: [How to win the climate change wars](http://americablog.com/2015/04/climate-change-wars.html) and frequently reports negatively on the Trump administration, [Mueller needs to explain why the F he didn’t indict Trump](http://elections.americablog.com/2019/06/mueller-needs-to-explain-why-the-f-he-didnt-indict-trump.html). In general, story selection favors the Progressive Left and denigrates the right, though the information is properly sourced.
