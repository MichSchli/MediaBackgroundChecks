History
The Greanville Post is a Left leaning news and opinion website that promotes Marxism and anti-corporate information. According to their
[about page](https://www.greanvillepost.com/crew-on-a-mission/) they are a “counter disinformation site; an instrument created to resist imperialism in the infowar sphere; seeking to spotlight the outrageous but increasingly common intersection of induced stupidity, high-handed political fraudulence and domestic and international criminality which characterize life in the American Empire in the early part of the 21st century.”
They further state, “We publish many types of anti-imperialist analysis, including a substantive amount of materials originating with Marxian sources. This is only logical, considering we operate as independent leftists with a strong Marxist foundation ourselves. We do not, however, endorse any faction or tendency, including Trotskyism.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Greanville Post claims they are an “Anti-Imperialist Tool”; they do this through publishing news and opinions that are anti-establishment and anti-capitalist. For example, they routinely report negatively on President Donald Trump as a Fascist, such as this:
[The fascists in the White House](https://www.greanvillepost.com/2019/07/16/the-fascists-in-the-white-house/). They also report negatively on centrist Democrats with this quote “For most of its history the US left has neglected or been incapable of developing a robust independent media apparatus of its own. By “left” I do not mean the centrist liberals, especially Democrats, who have almost somnambulistically co-opted the label “leftist” and have their own viewpoint amply represented throughout the corporate machine as well as supposedly “public venues ( [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), etc.)” The Greanville Post also reports [favorably about Russia](https://www.greanvillepost.com/2019/06/26/reagans-deception-committee-with-dirty-tricks-to-win-the-cold-war/), often accusing the USA of [conspiracies against them](https://www.greanvillepost.com/russia-desk/).
When it comes to science, they sometimes publish
[anti-vaccine pseudoscience](https://www.greanvillepost.com/2017/05/03/chronic-fatigue-syndromes-pots-and-the-dangers-of-aluminum-adjuvanted-vaccines-like-gardisil/) and [anti-GMO conspiracies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). In general, the Greanville Post publishes pro-Russian propaganda and conspiracies.
