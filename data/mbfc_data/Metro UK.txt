Analysis / Bias
In review, the Metro covers local news through staff journalists using minimal to moderate loaded language such as this:
[‘Serious’ explosion engulfs Peterborough Whirlpool factory in flames](https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/29/serious-explosion-engulfs-peterborough-hotpoint-factory-flames-10654620/?ito=cbshare). This story is sourced through videos, pictures, and first-person accounts. The story also covers sensationalized tabloid fare such as this: [Try telling this woman her prorogue rage is ‘phony.’](https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/29/try-telling-woman-prorogue-rage-phoney-10653097/?ito=cbshare)
Political news reporting is usually balanced and sourced; however, opinion pieces are almost always opposed to the right. For example, in this article:
[Boris Johnson is no better than a tin-pot dictator](https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/28/shutting-parliament-boris-johnson-acting-no-better-tin-pot-dictator-10646418/?ito=cbshare). News reporting is generally relatively low-biased, with several sensationalized pieces mixed in and op-eds moderately left-leaning in tone.
