Funded by / Ownership
The National Observer clearly discloses ownership on its about page: “National Observer is owned by Observer Media Group (OMG) and became a
[certified B corporation](https://www.nationalobserver.com/about/bcorp) in April 2018. OMG qualified for B Corp status for its social and environmental sustainability commitments, joining a global movement of people using business as a force for good.” The website is funded through donations and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the National Observer reports original news and curated stories from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/). News headlines typically utilize minimally loaded language such as this: [Trudeau to meet Pelosi, McConnell, as well as Trump in Washington](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/06/20/news/trudeau-meet-pelosi-mcconnell-well-trump-washington).
Editorially, there is a strong left-leaning bias through the
[promotion of environmentalism](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/06/17/opinion/canadian-government-making-smart-investments-electric-vehicles), equality for LGBTQ, and praise for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In general, the National Observer reports news factually and with proper sources; however, editorially, there is a clear lean left.
