Analysis / Bias
The Dorset Echo covers local news for Dorset and Weymouth through reporters with minimal bias, such as this
[Weymouth Town Bridge to close for weld repairs](https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/21379975.weymouth-town-bridge-close-weld-repairs/). The paper also publishes tabloid-style sensational news like this [“Will EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale be on after the Queens death?”](https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/21283697.will-eastenders-coronation-street-emmerdale-queens-death/) Regarding sourcing, they rely on first-person accounts and large quotes, which is appropriate for a print publication.
National and international news such as
[“Ukraine ‘pushes Russia back to border’ after retaking ‘village after village’’](https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/national/21303013.ukraine-pushes-russia-back-border-retaking-village-village/) is usually republished through reliable sources such as [PA Media](https://pamediagroup.com/) (national news agency for the UK and Ireland) and [The Sunday Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/).
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds, but when reporting on politics, they maintain a neutral stance such as this
[“Boris Johnson’s pledges as PM and how they impacted Dorset.”](https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/21149532.boris-johnson-look-back-major-pledges-impact-dorset/) Generally, the Dorset Echo is fact-based and presents a minimal bias in reporting.
