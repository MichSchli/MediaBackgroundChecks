History

FEE was founded by Leonard E. Read, Henry Hazlitt, David Goodrich, Donaldson Brown, Leo Wolman, Fred R. Fairchild, Claude E. Robinson, and Jasper Crane; the foundation is the oldest free-market think tank in the United States.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Foundation for Economic Education advocates for small government, deregulation, and low taxation while supporting civil liberties such as
[gay marriage](https://fee.org/articles/no-rick-santorum-the-gay-marriage-ruling-is-not-like-dred-scott/) and [marijuana legalization,](https://fee.org/articles/the-racist-roots-of-marijuana-prohibition/) in which they proclaim prohibition is “racist.” FEE uses moderately loaded words in headlines that economically favor the right, such as their consistent opposition to the minimum wage: [How Not to Argue Against the Minimum Wage.](https://fee.org/articles/how-not-to-argue-against-the-minimum-wage/)
When it comes to science, FEE does not align with the
[consensus of science](https://fee.org/search/?q=climate%20change) regarding climate change. While FEE [does not deny](https://fee.org/articles/free-trade-is-vital-for-dealing-with-any-climate-change/) that [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is occurring, they dispute the consensus regarding human impacts and the [possible consequences](https://fee.org/articles/why-we-need-more-climate-change-skeptics/) of lack of action. In general, FEE is socially left, as are most Libertarians, and fiscally far right.
