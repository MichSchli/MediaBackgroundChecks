Analysis / Bias
In review, In Homeland Security is a news and information blog covering military and security issues. There is minimal use of loaded words in the headlines, such as this:
[Does American Legacy Aircraft Top the F-35 in Counterinsurgency Operations?](https://inhomelandsecurity.com/american-legacy-aircraft-top-f-35/). Articles are categorized as being either original or curated from outside sources. Original articles are written by staff and generally are well-sourced to credible media. Curated articles typically come from credible sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, there is right-leaning bias that promotes the military and USA security issues. Again, these are generally free of loaded words. Further, a
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=inhomeland%20security&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have never failed a fact check.
