History
The Epoch Times is an international, multi-language news media company in print and online.
[The Epoch Times](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2010/06/the-epoch-times-doesnt-like-to-brag-067223) was first published in New York in April 2000 (in Chinese only) and the online edition in August 2000. In 2003, The Epoch Times launched an online edition in English, printing as a newspaper in New York in 2004. The Epoch Times was founded by [John Tang](http://www.epochmediagroup.com/) and a group of Chinese-American [Falun Gong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times) practitioners. The Epoch Times publishes in 21 languages in 35 countries across five continents. Their focus topics include sections for world and national news, op-eds, sports, entertainment, business, arts and culture, travel, and health.
On December 20, 2019, Facebook took down more than 600 accounts connected to The Epoch Times.
[According](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-says-pro-trump-media-outlet-used-artificial-intelligence-create-n1105951) to an NBC News report, “The network was called ‘The BL’ and was run by Vietnamese users posing as Americans, using fake photos generated by algorithms to simulate real identities. The Epoch Media group, which pushes a variety of pro-Trump conspiracy theories, spent $9.5 million on ads to spread content through the now-suspended pages and groups.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Epoch Times covers straight news reporting through journalists and low-biased syndication through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). However, when reporting on China, they do reflect a strong anti-communism bias. The Epoch Times also uses loaded language that favors the right, such as [Why Media Organizations Can’t Let Go of the Fake Russia-Collusion Narrative](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-media-organizations-cant-let-go-of-the-fake-russia-collusion-narrative_2428201.html).
Editorially, there is an extreme Pro-Trump bias. Almost all articles praise Trump or denigrate the left, such as these
[Democratic Party: A Broken Kaleidoscope?](https://www.theepochtimes.com/democratic-party-a-broken-kaleidoscope_2998525.html) and [Five Reasons Trump’s Celebration of America Was Epic Display of Patriotism](https://www.theepochtimes.com/five-reasons-trumps-celebration-of-america-was-epic-display-of-patriotism_2992722.html). According to an [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) [report](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1044121), the “outlet has spent more than $1.5 million on about 11,000 pro-Trump advertisements in the last six months (2020), according to data from Facebook’s advertising archive — more than any organization outside of the Trump campaign itself, and more than most Democratic presidential candidates have spent on their campaigns.”
In general, straight news reporting is sourced and mostly low-biased; however, op-eds 100% favor the right with some promoting conspiracy theories. During the Coronavirus outbreak and the 2020 Presidential election, they have promoted misinformation. See failed fact checks below.

Further, the Epoch Times frequently publishes pseudoscience news, such as
[Supernormal Abilities Developed Through Meditation: Dr. Dean Radin Discusses.](https://www.theepochtimes.com/supernormal-abilities-developed-through-meditation-dr-dean-radin-discusses_2157904.html) They also publish false claims from [Pseudoscience and anti-vaccination](https://m.theepochtimes.com/does-the-covid-jab-kill-more-people-than-it-saves_4442858.html) activist [Joeseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) who has a long track record of publishing misinformation. Finally, the above referenced NBC News report states, “In addition to claims that alien abductions are real and the “deep state engineered the drug epidemic,” the channel pushes the [QAnon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/qanon-pub/) conspiracy theory, which falsely posits that the same “Spygate” cabal is a front for a global pedophile ring being taken down by Trump.”
