History
[Campaign for Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Liberty) is a political organization founded by twelve-term United States, Congressman [Ron Paul](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-ron-paul-institute/). Campaign for Liberty focuses on educating elected officials and the general public about constitutional issues and currently provides a membership program. Its legal status is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit. According to Ron Paul, the purpose of the Campaign for Liberty is to continue the principles that invoked the grassroots support of his campaign and also to be able to continue the message that he promoted during his bid, without having a presidential campaign, and is also intended to “lay the groundwork for a different America.” It was also established as a reporting agency for news involved with the principles of the organization.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Campaign for Liberty states their policy positions on
[federal issues](http://campaignforliberty.org/federal-issues/) such as auditing the fed and defense of internet freedom. Their stated state issues are: Protection of the 1st Amendment, abolishing Common Core Education, healthcare being a state choice, and fighting against the police state. The blog consists of Ron Paul and others with a pro-libertarian bias. Campaign for Liberty uses minimal loaded words, and they usually source their information.
