Analysis / Bias
In review, WalesOnline publishes original news stories pertaining to Wales and the surrounding areas. They also provide national and international news. Headlines related to local news are low biased such as this
[Mobile camera catches more than 1,000 parking illegally outside Bridgend schools in first year](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/bridgend-council-parking-fines-schools-17246401).
WalesOnline publishes news in categories, with one category being politics. Under this category, there is a left-leaning editorial bias as many articles report unfavorably on Conservative Boris Johnson, such as this:
[Boris Johnson’s election broadcast shows he thinks we’re stupid | Will Hayward](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-conservative-election-broadcast-17249815). A review of op-eds shows that many favor the left, such as those with [anti-Brexit views](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/news-opinion/merry-election-everyone-brexmas-way-17229065) and those supporting [gender equality](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/news-opinion/listen-julia-gillard-time-stepped-17067034). In general, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
