Funded by / Ownership
The website and radio stations are owned by Bonneville International, a publishing company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is a subsidiary of
[Deseret Management Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_Management_Corporation), a holding company owned by the [Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_of_the_President_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints). Advertising, sponsored content, and subscription fees generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered by a combination of local journalists and curated content from other providers. Articles and headlines do not use loaded language, such as this
[Seattle police investigate series of assaults robberies in University District](https://mynorthwest.com/3325754/seattle-police-investigate-assaults-robberies-university-district/). National news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, there is a clear right-leaning bias as most of the radio personalities are
[conservative](http://mynorthwest.com/category/the-michael-medved-show/) or [libertarian](http://mynorthwest.com/category/the-dori-monson-show/), and their writings reflect that.
Failed Fact Checks
- None on the website; however, radio personalities may not always be factual.
