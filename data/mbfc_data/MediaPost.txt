Analysis / Bias
MediaPost publishes media and business-related news and opinions, such as stories on media innovations and marketing. Articles and headlines do not contain loaded emotional language such as this
[Mindshare: Americans Sustain Higher Levels Of Post-Pandemic Media Usage](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/367009/mindshare-americans-sustain-higher-levels-of-post.html). While they don’t often provide hyperlinked sourcing, they provide direct quotes from sources, which is acceptable.
Articles are appropriately labeled as “opinion” and are usually low biased; however, more op-eds tend to slightly favor the left, such as this
[Lack of Diversity In Market Research: What Can We Do?](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/367022/lack-of-diversity-in-market-research-what-can-we.html) In general, all news stories are fact-based with a slight left-leaning editorial bias; however, there is enough diversity to call this source least biased.
