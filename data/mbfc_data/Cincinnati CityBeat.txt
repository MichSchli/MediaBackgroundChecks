Analysis / Bias
The Cincinnati CityBeat covers local arts, food, culture, music, entertainment, and news for the Cincinnati Metro Area. Local news is generally reported via staff writers, with some in-depth pieces. Straight news uses minimally loaded words such as this:
[Fifty West Brewing Announces Reopening of Original Brewpub in Columbia Township](https://www.citybeat.com/food-drink/fifty-west-brewing-announces-reopening-of-original-brewpub-in-columbia-township-14507772). News stories are generally sourced through quotes, first-hand accounts, or hyperlinks.
Editorially, the Cincinnati CityBeat leans strongly left with progressive opinion/news pieces such as these:
[In Abortion Rights Victory, Kentucky Voters Shoot Down Constitutional Amendment ](https://www.citybeat.com/news/in-abortion-rights-victory-kentucky-voters-shoot-down-constitutional-amendment-14184116)and [My Gift to my Grandson is to Sound the Alarm of the Impending Climate Disaster](https://www.citybeat.com/news/guest-commentary-my-gift-to-my-grandson-is-to-sound-the-alarm-of-the-impending-climate-disaster-14382584). Generally, story selection moderately favors the left, while opinion-oriented pieces use strong emotional wording to denigrate the right. Most information is sourced properly.
