Analysis / Bias
In review, this website has only been publishing for 3 days at the time of this review. Thus far, all articles favor the right and denigrate the left. Headlines use loaded emotional language such as this:
[Trump Knocks Howard Schultz Off High Horse With Stinging Rebuke](https://magadailyreport.com/2019/01/trump-knocks-howard-schultz-off-high-horse-with-stinging-rebuke/). This article and those reviewed tend to be sourced properly to known credible media outlets such as [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). However, they also source to questionable outlets such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), which have poor track records with fact-checkers.
In general, MAGA Daily Report takes a news story, links to snippets or tweets and then James Murray opines around this story with a strong right-wing bias.
