History
AttackTheSystem.com is a site that publishes articles covering current events and opinion pieces favoring a form of Pan-anarchism.
Whois and Wayback Machine data both have the earliest records of the AttackTheSystem.com being created sometime between July 23 & 25 in 2001—But Whois data on
[AttackTheSystem.Wordpress.com](http://attackthesystem.wordpress.com/) date back to March 3, 2000; implying that the site was initially a free WordPress site that was upgraded and transferred to a new domain [attackthesystem.com](http://attackthesystem.com/).
However, the earliest posts on AttackTheSystem.com only date as far back as 2008. However, this page (
[https://attackthesystem.com/donate/](https://attackthesystem.com/donate/)) reaffirms that AttackTheSystem.com was created in January 2001. The 7-year-gap in posts implies a purge or transfer of ownership occurred.
Regardless, in the footer, the site is copyrighted to “American Revolutionary Vanguard,” which a Google search reveals is a neglected Blogspot site (
[https://attackthesystem.blogspot.com/](https://attackthesystem.blogspot.com/)) created by Keith Preston—Who is credited as the [“moving force”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National-anarchism#History) behind Attack The System and American Revolutionary Vanguard. Interestingly, American Revolutionary Vanguard activity started and ceased the same year AttackTheSystem.com was created—And the earliest post available on AttackTheSystem.com is also attributed to Keith Preston.
Funded by / Ownership
By all accounts, it appears that Attack The System is a rebranding of the American Revolutionary Vanguard and is still owned by Keith Preston.
The site contains no advertisements, but it links to affiliated sites and periodically sponsors a book related to anarchism. Still, it appears that donations mainly fund the site via PayPal.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the site is spearheaded by Keith Preston, who continues to operate the site and write its articles. Preston is a pan-anarchist who has
[written articles](https://newpol.org/rising-above-herd-keith-prestons-authoritarian-anti-statism/) for AlternativeRight.com and paleoconservative or libertarian sites like [Taki’s Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/takis-magazine/), [LewRockwell.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/), and Anti-State.com.
The headlines occasionally use loaded language, e.g.,
[“The New York Times Is Now Officially Chinese Communist Propaganda”](https://attackthesystem.com/2021/01/06/the-new-york-times-is-now-officially-chinese-communist-propaganda/) and this [Leftists Sell Out, Congratulating Billionaires for Fascist Depravity.](https://attackthesystem.com/2021/01/10/leftists-sell-out-congratulating-billionaires-for-fascist-depravity/) Further, they endorse anarchism with its motto, “Pan-Anarchism Against the State, Pan-Secessionism Against the Empire, Pan-Socratism Against Dogma.”
The site also prominently features links to the
[National-Anarchist Movement](http://national-anarchist.net/), [The Menken Club](http://hlmenckenclub.org/), [Global Revolutionary Alliance](http://granews.info/), [Lew Rockwell](https://lewrockwell.com/), [The Revolutionary Right](https://therevolutionaryconservative.com/), among other right-wing or anarchist sites as well as those from a more socialist left perspective such as [Counter-Punch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/counterpunch/), [Earth First,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/earth-first-journal/) International Workers Association, Occupy Wall Street, and [World Socialist Web Site](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-socialist-web-site/) Although the site supports left-libertarians such as Noam Chomsky and others, they most often favor the far left or far right and harshly denigrate the establishment such as this [We Should Be Very Worried About Joe Biden’s “Domestic Terrorism” Bill](https://attackthesystem.com/2021/01/12/we-should-be-very-worried-about-joe-bidens-domestic-terrorism-bill/). Further, they are very critical of President Trump and corporate conservatives such as this [“It is Only a Matter of Time Before a More Competent Trump Emerges.”](https://attackthesystem.com/2021/01/11/it-is-only-a-matter-of-time-before-a-more-competent-trump-emerges/) When it comes to the sourcing of information, they utilize a wide variety of sources such as the Socialist leaning [Jacobin](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jacobin/) and [Left Voice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left-voice/) and Libertarian publications such as [Reason](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/).
Editorially, Attack the System is difficult to pin down. The end game is an anti-authoritarian, anti-corporate, Libertarian system that eliminates the state. They claim they are willing to work with any group with similar goals, whether they fall along the left or right politically. With that said, although the Left establishment
[ claims](https://newpol.org/rising-above-herd-keith-prestons-authoritarian-anti-statism/) this source to be right-wing, our review does not bear that out. The majority of the stories reviewed and the general message of the website endorse left-libertarianism and fully rejects the establishment corporate state. For this reason, we rate the bias of Attack the System to be Left.
