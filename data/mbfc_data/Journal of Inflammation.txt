Analysis / Bias
Journal of Inflammation is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to inflammation research. The journal primarily publishes research like this
[Towards clinical application of GlycA and GlycB for early detection of inflammation associated with (pre)diabetes and cardiovascular disease: recent evidence and updates](https://journal-inflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12950-023-00358-7).
BioMed Central (BMC) is an open-access publisher of scientific journals. There are two types of Open Access Journals, legitimate and predatory, both of which charge the author for publication.
[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. BioMed Central is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, BMC journals have been criticized for [retracting numerous studies](https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/mass-retraction-35728) due to fake peer reviews or poor methodology.
Although BMC has retracted some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed, the Journal of Inflammation publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
