Analysis / Bias
HealthyPlace’s content is primarily produced by journalists specializing in health articles, with medical-mental health accuracy reviewed by their Medical Director, Dr. Harry Croft, a triple board-certified psychiatrist. The website also complies with the
[HONcode standard](https://www.nicer.org/en/background-legal-basis/hon-code/#:~:text=The%20HONcode%20certification%20is%20an,useful%2C%20objective%20and%20correct%20data.) for trustworthy health information.
A review of articles and information reveals minimal bias in wording like this:
[Managing a Career With a Mental Illness](https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/recoveringfrommentalillness/2023/12/managing-a-career-with-a-mental-illness). This article, like all other content reviewed, relies on proper sourcing from credible outlets.
Editorially, the article titled “
[Professionals Should Talk About Trump’s Mental Health](https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/breakingbipolar/2017/02/professionals-should-talk-about-trumps-mental-health)” is critical of Donald Trump, primarily arguing that mental health professionals should openly discuss Trump’s mental health and fitness for the presidency due to the potential impact of his mental state on job performance and national safety. This indicates a left-leaning bias when reporting on political figures and mental health.
