Analysis / Bias
In review, Regulation covers microeconomics and regulatory policy from a right-leaning Libertarian perspective. Articles are usually written by prominent economists, political scientists, and law professors. Articles and headlines always match and do not use loaded language such as this
[The Limits of Antitrust in the 21st Century](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-06/regulation-v43n2-2.pdf). Basically, content on Regulation is also published on Cato. Therefore we assign the same rating.
