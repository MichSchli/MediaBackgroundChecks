History
[Founded in 2001](http://whois.domaintools.com/globalresearch.ca), GlobalResearch, or Centre for Research on Globalization is a Canadian conspiracy website. It was founded by [Michel Chossudovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chossudovsky), who is currently the President of GlobalResearch and professor emeritus of economics at the University of Ottawa. The website does not have an about page, but [they list the people involved with the operation](https://www.globalresearch.ca/contact-2).

Analysis / Bias
In review, GlobalResearch publishes a combination of real news and conspiracy theories. We will focus on the not-so-real news. GlobalResearch often reports unfavorably about Israel, such as this:
[The Zionist Idea Has Never Been More Terrifying than It Is Today](https://www.globalresearch.ca/zionist-idea-more-terrifying-today/5677171). This unlabeled opinion piece does not provide a single source of evidence for their claims. When it comes to politics, they are strongly [anti-capitalist](https://www.globalresearch.ca/search?q=capitalism&x=0&y=0) and [anti-Globalist](https://www.globalresearch.ca/search?q=globalization&x=0&y=0), as their name suggests. While GlobalResearch does promote legitimate humanitarian concerns, its views on science, economics, and geopolitics are questionable. For example, [GR promotes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://www.globalresearch.ca/uncovering-the-cover-up-scientific-analysis-of-the-vaccine-autism-connection-deeply-flawed-vaccine-policies/5491987), [9-11 as a false flag operation](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-911-attacks-keeping-the-lid-on-the-lie-media-response-to-the-growing-influence-of-the-911-truth-movement/5373217), [GMOs are harmful](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), and [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/). Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they have routinely promoted disinformation as evidenced in the failed fact checks.
In general, this website purports to be concerned for humanity yet routinely publishes false information that misleads humanity.
