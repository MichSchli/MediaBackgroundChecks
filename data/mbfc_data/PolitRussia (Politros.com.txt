Analysis / Bias
PolitRussia or Politros.com is strongly biased in its articles and often favors the Russian government and President Putin.
Articles and headlines use emotionally loaded language such as
[“Putin suggested checking Nord Stream for the presence of explosive devices.”](https://politros.com/23940546-putin_predlozhil_proverit_severnie_potoki_na_nalichie_vzrivnih_ustroistv) Further, PolitRussia’s story selection is often favorable to the Russian government, and President Putin, such as this [“Putin recognizes the occupation of Germany by American troops.”](https://politros.com/23940571-putin_priznal_okkupatsiyu_germanii_amerikanskimi_voiskami) A quote from the article reads, “The Russian leader stressed that the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Germany, unlike the United States.” They also appear to favor [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), as [Russian media](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/technology/russia-media-fox-news.html) has been using Fox News to paint a critical portrait of the United States. This is an example article published by PolitRussia: “ [Fox News host Carlson told Ukraine the harsh truth about Crimea.”](https://politros.com/23940250-veduschii_fox_news_karlson_ozvuchil_ukraine_surovuyu_pravdu_o_krime)
Another article with an emotionally loaded headline is this:
[“Head of Ukraine Zelensky accidentally left his signature in the “document” on the surrender of the country,”](https://politros.com/23853918-glava_ukraini_zelenskii_nechayanno_ostavil_podpis_v_dokumente_o_kapitulyatsii_strani) a quote from the article reads, “President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky accidentally signed the “act” on the surrender of the country. This was reported by the media.” Regarding sourcing PolitRussia rarely sources; for example, this article is sourced from an anonymous media outlet. Further, we could not find any [credible media outlets](https://www.google.com/search?q=Volodymyr+Zelensky+signed+the+%22act%22+on+the+surrender+of+the+country&biw=1920&bih=880&tbm=nws&sxsrf=AJOqlzVoT8wYEdy4lJ4ucQelkJHLqEK-9g%3A1678829080639&ei=GOYQZKzRJpmkqtsPhZ-vuAU&ved=0ahUKEwisvfXXrdz9AhUZkmoFHYXPC1cQ4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=Volodymyr+Zelensky+signed+the+%22act%22+on+the+surrender+of+the+country&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MQA1AAWIYyYNBaaABwAHgAgAFhiAGoAZIBATKYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-news) reporting this story.
PolitRussia holds a right-leaning bias, frequently publishes pro-government, anti-west propaganda, and poorly sources its information. Further, they are connected to a known Russian troll farm that disseminated disinformation in the past.
