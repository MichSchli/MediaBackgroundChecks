History
[NumbersUSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumbersUSA) is an immigration reduction organization that seeks to reduce US immigration levels to pre-1965 levels without country of origin quotas as established in the Immigration Act of 1924. NumbersUSA was founded by Roy Beck while he worked for anti-immigration activist [John Tanton,](https://www.splcenter.org/20090201/nativist-lobby-three-faces-intolerance) who has been described as a racist. NumbersUSA is also connected to the [Federation for American Immigration Reform](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federation-for-american-immigration-reform-fair/) and the [Center for Immigration Studies](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-immigration-studies-cis/), via John Tanton. Both of these groups are considered to be [racist organizations.](https://www.splcenter.org/20090201/nativist-lobby-three-faces-intolerance)
According to there
[about page](https://www.numbersusa.com/about), “NumbersUSA Education & Research Foundation provides a civil forum for Americans of all political and ethnic backgrounds to focus on a single issue, the numerical level of U.S. immigration. We educate opinion leaders, policymakers and the public on immigration legislation, policies and their consequences. We favor reductions in immigration numbers toward traditional levels that would allow present and future generations of Americans to enjoy a stabilizing U.S. population and a high degree of individual liberty, mobility, environmental quality, worker fairness and fiscal responsibility.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, NumbersUSA is an organization that advocates for limited immigration through lobbying and dissemination of information on their website. The website publishes news from other sources that often come from questionable sources such as this from
[Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/): [Judge Blocks Enforcement of Biden’s Deportation Pause](https://www.numbersusa.com/news/judge-blocks-enforcement-biden%E2%80%99s-deportation-pause). Other poor sources used are the [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), however, many are properly sourced to credible outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/), and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/). The website also features a blog that is written by NumbersUSA staff that is in line with their low immigration advocacy such as this [Biden moves step closer to ‘Magic Kingdom Pass’ for illegal immigration](https://www.numbersusa.com/blog/biden-moves-step-closer-magic-kingdom-pass-illegal-immigration). This particular blog post contains stats and figures but not hyperlink citations to other sources making it difficult for the reader to determine the validity of the information.
Editorially, NumbersUSA strongly favors the right and routinely denigrates the left such as this
[Biden Immigration Outline: A Wish-List for Open Borders Lobby](https://www.numbersusa.com/blog/biden-immigration-outline-wish-list-open-borders-lobby). Although NumbersUSA is affiliated with John Tanton, our review does not reveal racist content. While their position of low immigration can be interpreted in different ways, there is not evidence of racial bias. In general, NumbersUSA is Right Biased and not a reliable source of information based on the use of poor sources and failed fact checks.
