Analysis / Bias
Pulse Nigeria reports news summaries and commentary on Nigerian and international news. Articles and headlines often contain minimally loaded emotional language. However, they report favorably on the center-left party APC, such as here “
[Tinubu emergence, sign of better days for Nigeria – Akpabio](https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/tinubu-emergence-sign-of-better-days-for-nigeria-akpabio/zyc327k),” ‘ [If I can do this, you can do better,’ Tinubu tries to inspire Nigerians”](https://www.pulse.ng/news/politics/tinubu-calls-for-unity-after-controversial-election-win/41r38rg) and [“Be like Jonathan; accept defeat – APC tells Atiku Abubakar, Peter Obi.”](https://www.pulse.ng/news/politics/be-like-jonathan-accept-defeat-apc-tells-atiku-abubakar-peter-obi/90xvky6) Peter Obi (presidential candidate for the Labour Party), Atiku Abubakar (presidential candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party) and Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu is the president-elect of Nigeria.
Pulse Nigeria primarily uses The News Agency of Nigeria (a news reporting agency owned and run by the Federal Government of Nigeria). Regarding sourcing, they rarely use hyperlinks and often utilize quotes.
Generally, story selection is balanced; however, reviewing opinion pieces reveals a left-leaning editorial bias. Finally, the website endorses left-leaning issues like gender equality,
[“Death of homogeneity and the rise of gender diversity in Tech”](https://www.pulse.ng/business/local/death-of-homogeneity-and-the-rise-of-gender-diversity-in-tech/4cvg8k4) and concern for [climate change.](https://www.pulse.ng/business/build-for-change-landweys-social-impact-initiative-set-to-protect-the-environment-and/65de01g) In general, Pulse Nigeria holds a left-leaning editorial bias, has failed a fact check, and does not properly source all information.
