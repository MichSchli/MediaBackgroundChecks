[Guilford County’s Government Plaza Closing For Nearly A Year And A Half](https://www.rhinotimes.com/news/guilford-countys-government-plaza-closing-for-nearly-a-year-and-a-half/). However some articles contain emotionally loaded language that conveys a conservative bias like this [Jaiyeoba’s Motion In BWC Video Release Case Has Puzzling Timeline](https://www.rhinotimes.com/news/jaiyeobas-motion-in-bwc-video-release-case-has-puzzling-timeline/). All news stories are properly sourced from first person accounts and government records, however, there is a lack of hyperlinks to verify the information.
Editorially, the Rhino Times openly disclaims its conservative alignment. Op-eds mostly favor a conservative perspective like this

Another example of conservative bias is the frequent endorsements of Republican candidates such as this [Send Mark Walker Back To Congress](https://www.rhinotimes.com/editorials/send-mark-walker-back-to-congress/). They were among the first publications to [endorse Donald Trump for President in 2024](https://www.rhinotimes.com/news/rhino-endorsements-in-republican-primary/#google_vignette).
