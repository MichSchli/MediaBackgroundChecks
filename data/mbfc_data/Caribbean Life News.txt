Analysis / Bias
In review, Caribbean Life utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines, such as
[“Caribbean Pan-African leaders to Trump: ‘Persona non-grata’”](https://www.caribbeanlifenews.com/stories/2018/1/2018-01-19-nk-trump-persona-non-grata-cl.html) and Caribbean Life uses credible sources such as the [New York Times,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) but they typically source [through quotes](https://www.caribbeanlifenews.com/stories/2018/3/2018-03-23-nk-dems-campaigain-women-gala-cl.html) in their reporting. In general, story selection favors the left, and a [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Caribbean%20Life%20News&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have not failed a fact check. The political alignment of this tabloid fits the audience they target, and in this case, the Caribbean community is traditionally left-leaning.
