History
Founded in 2020 by
[Emily Ramshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Ramshaw) and [Amanda Zamora](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amanda_Zamora&action=edit&redlink=1), The 19th News is a nonprofit organization and website that serves women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community. According to their [about page](https://19thnews.org/about/) they state “We’re an independent, nonprofit newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.” The name of the organization is based on the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. They add an asterisk at the end to indicate that work still needs to be done as women and minorities continue to be disenfranchised at the ballot box.
Both Emily Ramshaw and Amanda Zamora were formerly on staff at the left-leaning

Analysis / Bias
In review, The 19th primarily reports news and commentary on government and politics as it relates to women, the LGBTQ community, and people of color. The 19th publishes original news reporting and often with minimally loaded wording such as this
[Law enforcement officers keep arresting Black women elected officials](https://19thnews.org/2021/03/law-enforcement-officers-keep-arresting-black-women-elected-officials/). This story like all the rest is properly sourced to credible media and information outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), Rutgers.edu, [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Story selection favors the left covering topics such as climate change, human rights, and inequality.
Editorially, The 19th aligns with the left as they frequently publish negative articles concerning conservatives and in particular former President Trump such as this
[Trump wielded toxic masculinity as a weapon. It hurt America.](https://19thnews.org/2021/01/trump-toxic-masculinity-harm/) In 2020 and 2021, they reported on the Coronavirus as it relates to women, POC, and the LGBTQ always taking a pro-science approach [CDC study shows gender, racial gaps in COVID cases among young people](https://19thnews.org/2021/03/cdc-study-shows-gender-racial-gaps-in-covid-cases-among-young-people/). Further, they support the consensus of science when it comes to climate change. In general, The 19th reports the news factually and with a consistent left-leaning progressive bias.
