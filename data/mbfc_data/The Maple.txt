History
Founded in 2017 as
[North99](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/north99/), The Maple is a Progressive leaning news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://north99.org/about/) “The Maple is an independent digital news publication, covering Canadian politics from the perspective of the many, not the few.” A [whois search](http://whois.domaintools.com/north99.org) reveals the North99 domain was purchased in August of 2017.
Under the Our History section, they state, “After seeing how social media algorithms throttled political content, and observing the power of independent media across the country, North99 pivoted to become The Maple, a journalistic publication focused on news and investigations.”

Analysis / Bias
The Maple is a left-leaning news and opinion website and newsletter. The news they report usually favors the left and uses loaded language such as this:
[No Oversight For The Rich, Little Forgiveness For The Poor](https://www.readthemaple.com/cerb-cews-no-oversight-for-the-rich-little-forgiveness-for-the-poor/). This story, like most reviewed, relies on credible sources such as the [CBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/), [Toronto Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-star/), and [Wall Street Journal](https://www.readthemaple.com/cerb-cews-no-oversight-for-the-rich-little-forgiveness-for-the-poor/).
Editorially, the majority of opinion pieces favor a progressive left perspective such as this
[Why Does Canadian Media Love Licking This Billionaire’s Boots?](https://www.readthemaple.com/why-does-canadian-media-love-licking-this-billionaires-boots/) They also criticize establishment liberals such as this [Will The NDP Ever Hold The Liberals To Account For Their Scandals?](https://www.readthemaple.com/will-the-ndp-ever-hold-the-liberals-to-account-for-their-scandals/) In general, The Maple holds progressive left biases and is fact-based in reporting.
