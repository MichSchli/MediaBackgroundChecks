History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/conservativebeaver.com), the ConservativeBeaver.com is an anonymously run conservative news and opinion website that routinely publishes misleading or false information. According to their [about page](https://www.conservativebeaver.com/about/), “The Conservative Beaver has been informing Canadians for over 10 years. Starting in a U of O dorm room, eventually spreading through Montreal as an underground newspaper.”
The website lacks transparency as it does not list names associated with the website or ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Conservative Beaver primarily republishes and summarizes news stories from other sources. Most stories contain loaded emotional language such as this
[Dear US media, we don’t need Russia to attack our power grid, we’re perfectly capable of tanking it ourselves…just look at Texas](https://www.conservativebeaver.com/2021/02/17/dear-us-media-we-dont-need-russia-to-attack-our-power-grid-were-perfectly-capable-of-tanking-it-ourselves-just-look-at-texas/). When it comes to sourcing, they frequently use questionable sources such as [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) and [OAN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/). When they produce original content, it is not always factual.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and often promote misinformation, as evidenced by numerous failed fact checks seen below. In general, Conservative Beaver is strongly right-biased and not a credible source for news.
