Analysis / Bias
Policy-wise, they advocate for limited government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, a free-market economy, and traditional values (see
[our principles](https://isi.org/about-us/)). Articles generally feature proper sourcing. For example, the article “ [Conservatism: Trump and Beyond”](https://isi.org/modern-age/conservatism-trump-and-beyond/) by Buckley analyzes Trump’s impact on conservative thought, highlighting themes like mobility, jobs, religion, and nationalism. Buckley criticizes both Democrats and the Republican establishment, showing a populist conservative viewpoint. He commends Trump for creating a socially conservative and economically moderate party. However, Buckley’s analysis is opinionated, selectively presenting facts to support a conservative perspective. Buckley asserts, “What had made us unequal and immobile were the barriers the Democrats had erected.” This statement indicates a partisan perspective, attributing social issues to the actions of a particular political party.
He critiques the Republican establishment, too, stating, “The Republican establishment denied that we were immobile or said that the swinish multitude had brought its misery on itself.” This critique of the establishment from a conservative standpoint indicates a more populist conservative viewpoint. Buckley praises Trump’s approach: “What they gave us was a very different party, one that is socially conservative and economically liberal or middle of the road…” which shows an approval of Trump’s deviation from traditional conservative policies.
Similarly, David Lewis Schaefer’s
[“The Progressive Betrayal of America’s Founding Principles”](https://isi.org/modern-age/the-progressive-betrayal-of-americas-founding-principles/) reflects a conservative bias, critiquing progressivism through historical and academic references. In both cases, the articles reflect the viewpoints and biases of their authors, which is not uncommon in opinion pieces. Buckley’s article seems more opinionated. However, Buckley attempts to ground his analysis in a mix of contemporary research and classical political philosophy sources, which he lists at the end of his article. The contemporary sources (from the [Brookings Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/) and Yale School of Management) provide current socio-economic data, while the classical texts offer a philosophical and historical foundation. Meanwhile, despite being more research-oriented, Schaefer’s work still interprets the information through a conservative lens. This approach is typical in ideologically driven publications, where the selection and interpretation of sources often align with the publication’s overall perspective.
