Analysis / Bias
In review, News Hour First does not feature original reporting but rather summarized news stories with added conservative commentary. Articles and headlines almost always contain strong, loaded, emotionally charged wording that favors the right such as this
[Democrats FORCED to Admit All Their Sly Covid Pork Vocally on the Senate Floor](https://newshourfirst.com/2021/03/05/democrats-forced-to-admit-all-their-sly-covid-pork-vocally-on-the-senate-floor/) and this [After Republicans Put a Stop to Joes Nonsense, Beijing Biden Crying like the Kids He Sniffs.](https://newshourfirst.com/2021/03/03/after-republicans-put-a-stop-to-joes-nonsense-beijing-biden-crying-like-the-kids-he-sniffs/)
Editorially, all stories favor the right and especially former President Donald Trump, while denigrating the left. During 2020, they promoted

In this article, they reference a Danish Mask Study [Danish study finds masks donâ€™t do much](https://www.independentsentinel.com/danish-study-finds-masks-dont-do-much/) that has been rated as [Unsupported](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/danish-face-mask-study-did-not-show-that-masks-were-ineffective-at-reducing-spread-of-covid-19-study-was-underpowered-and-results-were-inconclusive/) by IFCN fact-checker [Health Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-feedback/). Further, during and after the 2020 Presidential Election, News Hour First promoted election fraud conspiracies such as this [Massive Voter Fraud DUMP Discovered!](https://newshourfirst.com/2020/12/31/trashed/) As of this date, there has not been [evidence produced](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/08/supreme-court-declines-hear-trump-election-claim-wisconsin/4628242001/) to indicate any widespread, consequential election fraud occurred. In general, News Hour First is a far-right biased source that completely lacks credibility.
