Analysis / Bias
National Zero publishes news and opinion articles from a progressive liberal perspective. Articles typically summarize a known news story and add left-leaning commentary. Headlines and the content of articles often use emotional wording such as this
[Eight confirmed deaths, more expected in massive Kentucky flooding; Governor sends rescuers, while Rand Paul, wife are dicks](https://nationalzero.com/2022/07/28/eight-confirmed-deaths-more-expected-in-massive-kentucky-flooding-governor-sends-rescuers-while-rand-paul-wife-are-dicks/). This story is sourced from the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and Tweets.
Editorially, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right such as this
[Text messages from Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary, deputy missing from days around January 6th GOP terrorist attack](https://nationalzero.com/2022/07/28/text-messages-from-trumps-homeland-security-secretary-deputy-missing-from-days-around-january-6th-gop-terrorist-attack/). The wording within articles [harshly criticizes the right](https://nationalzero.com/2022/07/28/the-recession-that-isnt/) “Like the vast majority of young Republican politicians, Lauren Boebert is an idiot. Declaring that the US “officially enter[ed] into a recession” is not just factually inaccurate, it demonstrates that the GED-issued alleged former prostitute abortionist didn’t study economics to “graduate” from high school.”
In general, the information presented on National Zero is rooted in fact and sourced from credible media outlets; however, the wording and one-sided reporting render the source misleading and propagandistic.
