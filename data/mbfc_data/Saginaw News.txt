Analysis / Bias
The Saginaw News publishes local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this
[A collared wolf from Michiganâ€™s U.P. roamed more than 4,000 miles before it was killed](https://www.mlive.com/news/2023/01/a-collared-wolf-from-michigans-up-roamed-more-than-4000-miles-before-it-was-killed.html). National and international news is reported through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other Advance publications.
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion content from a wide, but never extreme, and reasonably balanced perspective. The Saginaw News is a reliable, low-biased, and factual source of information for Michigan News.
