Analysis / Bias
In reviewing ValueWalk, I found several instances where they were negative toward left activists. You can see examples
[here](http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/08/business-advisory-councils/) and [here](http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/08/niketown/). ValueWalk uses minimal loaded words in their articles, and everything is sourced to credible information.
Editorially, they often report negatively on Democrats and the Biden administration, such as this
[THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS FEELING THE INFLATION HEAT.](https://www.valuewalk.com/biden-administration-feeling-inflation-heat/) When reporting on Covid-19 and climate change, they take pro-science positions but prefer limited government interventions. In general, they are factual but hold mostly conservative biases.
