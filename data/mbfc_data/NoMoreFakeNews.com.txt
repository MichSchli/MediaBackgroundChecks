Analysis / Bias
NoMoreFakeNews.com has a tagline that reads “The Real News,” which ironically contradicts what this website publishes. Jon Rappoport promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience using emotional wording such as this
[Open letter to FBI, NYT, WaPo: ongoing destruction of food processing plants across America](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2022/04/25/ongoing-destruction-of-food-processing-plants-across-america/). This story references the disreputable sources of the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/).
While NoMoreFakeNews.com covers a wide range of conspiracy theories at this time, they are focused on promoting disinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. For example, the article
[Vaccine shedding spreads disaster to unvaccinated pregnant women?](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2022/02/18/vaccine-shedding-spreads-disaster-to-unvaccinated-pregnant-women/) Promotes the false claim that the vaccinated shed the vaccine to others. [This is not true](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-covid-19-vaccines-spike-protein-only-get-into-those-who-receive-it-no-shedding/). They have also claimed that the Coronavirus does not exist [The Smoking Gun: Where is the coronavirus? The CDC says it isn’t available.](https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/08/the-smoking-gun-where-is-the-coronavirus-the-cdc-says-it-isnt-available/) This is also false as the virus [does exist.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html)
Finally, Jon Rappoport holds a right-leaning bias by promoting that the Jan 6 Capitol Riot was a
[false flag operation](https://web.archive.org/web/20210108152230/https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2021/01/08/false-flag-at-capitol-the-effects-and-after-shocks/). In general, NoMoreFakeNews.com is an actual fake news website that promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
