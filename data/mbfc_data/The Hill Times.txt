Analysis / Bias
The Hill Times publishes original news focused on Parliament Hill. The news is broken into sections, opinion, foreign policy, politics, policy, legislation, and lobbying. Articles and headlines use moderately loaded language, such as this
[Canadian government faces ‘fraught’ situation with volunteers joining Ukraine’s defence](https://www.hilltimes.com/2022/03/23/canadian-government-faces-fraught-situation-with-volunteers-joining-ukraines-defence/351357). Articles rely on credible sources such as the [CBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/).
Editorially, opinion pieces cover both sides with a reasonable balance. For example, this op-ed favors the left
[Poverty rates are falling: has anybody noticed?](https://www.hilltimes.com/2022/03/31/poverty-rates-are-falling-has-anybody-noticed/353060) Another favors the right [Mixed reviews for Liberal solution to protect Quebec seats.](https://www.hilltimes.com/2022/03/29/mixed-reviews-for-liberal-solution-to-protect-quebec-seats/352687) However, when taken as a whole more op-eds favor the left. In general, The Hill Times is fact-based and leans slightly left editorially.
