In review, the CBS New York website publishes sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and local news for the greater New York City region through
[CBSN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/).

A video accompanies most stories from the TV station. National news stories are published from other [CBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) affiliates as well as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, CBS New York does not publish op-eds; however, they do report on politics with slightly more stories favoring the left, such as this
[President Joe Biden Lifts Muslim Travel Ban, Giving Immigrants In New York Hope](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/01/21/biden-muslim-travel-ban/), and this [Jack Ciattarelli Wins New Jersey GOP Primary, Beating Trump Boosters](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/08/jack-ciattarelli-new-jersey-governor-republican-nominee/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias when covering politics.
