Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Herald (TNH) publishes interviews with Greek politicians such as
[here.](https://www.thenationalherald.com/archive_politics_usa/arthro/exclusive_interview_with_greek_ambassador_alexandra_papadopoulou-536575/) Headlines are moderately emotional in a tone such as this [“Second Open Letter to President Donald Trump.”](https://www.thenationalherald.com/opinions_editorial/arthro/second_open_letter_to_president_donald_trump-590590/) The article is urging former President Donald Trump to phone Erdogan to reverse his decision to turn Hagia Sophia into a mosque. There is also a first letter, [“Open Letter from A. Diamataris to President Trump,”](https://www.thenationalherald.com/opinions_editorial/arthro/open_letter_from_a_diamataris_to_president_trump-585412/) with a quote that reads, “You will earn the gratitude of countless Christians in the United States and internationally. And you will have done both what is right and what is just and also, for God’s sake, tell him not to dare disturb the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Hellenes of the City.”
Typically stories are poorly sourced and politically lean right. For example, when covering Greece, they use strong, emotionally loaded headlines covering Syriza (Left-wing political party in Greece)
[“Letter from Athens: Something’s Rotten in The State of SYRIZA.”](https://www.thenationalherald.com/opinions_columnists/arthro/letter_from_athens_something_s_rotten_in_the_state_of_syriza-541963/) A quote from the article reads, “That too, was a lie, of course, the party’s core morally corrupt, and the sewage is rising to the top now, a year after the Leftists and then-Premier Alexis ‘Clueless’ Tsipras were bounced in the July 7, 2019 snap elections by New Democracy and now Prime Minister Kyriakos ‘Deep Blue’ Mitsotakis.” They refer to former prime minister Alexis Tsipras as “Premier Alexis ‘Clueless’ Tsipras.” While [Center-Right](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48902766) New Democracy party leader and current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis are referred to as “Kyriakos ‘Deep Blue’ Mitsotakis,” which is favorable towards him.
In another
[article](https://www.thenationalherald.com/opinions/arthro/an_open_letter_from_the_publisher_editor_of_the_national_herald-55128/), they state, “The new Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has honored me by inviting me to serve Hellenes Abroad in a new capacity: as the Deputy Foreign Minister Responsible for Hellenes Abroad.”
The National Herald (TNH) covers the former Trump Administration in a positive tone, such as this
[“Three Greek-Americans Honored by President Trump, Talk to TNH”](https://www.thenationalherald.com/archive_general_news_community/arthro/three_greek_americans_honored_by_president_trump_talk_to_tnh-25409/) and establishment Democrats negatively [“Hillary, Go Home](https://www.thenationalherald.com/archive_view_points/arthro/hillary_go_home-5892/).” Further, some stories pertaining to US politics are covered through credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). In general, news reporting appears factual but with poor sourcing techniques that do not utilize hyperlinks and a strong right-leaning editorial bias.
