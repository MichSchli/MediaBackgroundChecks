Analysis / Bias
In our analysis, InstaPundit shares
[articles](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/sentencing-punctuates-downfall-of-former-fbi-counterintelligence-chief-52eb4fdd?st=t190uznt6yh4pfl&reflink=article_email_share) from news outlets like the [Wall Street Journal (WSJ).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) However, they often frame these articles through their commentary, which includes strong opinions and interpretations.
InstaPundit frequently employs emotionally loaded language, as evident in the example,
[“THEY WERE GOING AFTER TRUMP WHEN ALL ALONG THE RUSSIAN COLLUSION WAS COMING FROM INSIDE THE FBI.”](https://instapundit.com/622128/) Such language aims to evoke specific feelings and sway readers’ opinions. When InstaPundit does quote from credible sources, their own commentary may not always be factually accurate or adequately supported by evidence. For instance, the claim about “Russian collusion coming from inside the FBI” lacks supporting evidence and oversimplifies a complex issue.
Furthermore, InstaPundit generally selectively quotes from the original articles, potentially omitting information that contradicts their viewpoint. The repeated use of emotionally loaded language and biased wording suggests a bias toward a particular political view. In the provided example, the focus on
[Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and the FBI aligns with conservative viewpoints on these issues. Generally, InstaPundit’s approach combines a mix of credible news sources and questionable ones with their commentary and interpretations.
A second example is that Instapundit shares articles from questionable sources, like
[townhall.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), which claimed that [“Secret Documents Reveal Biden’s Border Crisis Was An Intentional Policy.”](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/01/14/secret-documents-reveal-bidens-border-crisis-was-an-intentional-policy-n2633600) The article was accompanied by comments such as [“WELL, YES, JUST LIKE BRITAIN’S IMMIGRATION WAVE.” ](https://instapundit.com/626769/#disqus_thread) In this instance, the post refers to “secret documents” without specifying their source or providing information about their authenticity or verification, which casts doubt on the evidence.
Furthermore, the statement “Biden’s Border Crisis Was An Intentional Policy” frames the issue as a deliberate decision by the current administration without presenting any context or details about the underlying factors contributing to the situation. Finally, InstaPundit also references factually questionable sources, such as
[ Frontpagemag](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontpage-magazine/), [American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/), [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), and [The College Fix.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-college-fix/) In general, Instapundit holds a conservative bias and sometimes promotes [conspiracy theories](https://pjmedia.com/stephen-kruiser/2021/01/05/the-morning-briefing-can-the-democrats-start-2021-with-another-stolen-election-n1304946) and false information.
