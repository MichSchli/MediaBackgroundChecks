History
Founded in 1990, City Journal is a quarterly magazine and website published by the
[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/manhattan-institute-for-policy-research/), a conservative think tank based in New York City. According to their [about page](https://www.city-journal.org/about), “City Journal offers a stimulating mix of hard-headed practicality and cutting-edge theory, with articles on everything from school financing, policing strategy, and welfare policy to urban architecture, family policy, and the latest theorizing emanating from the law schools, the charitable foundations, even the schools of public health.” The current editor is [Brian C. Anderson.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_C._Anderson)
City Journal writes on their about page that they helped save New York City in the ’90s: “During the Giuliani Administration, the magazine served as an idea factory as the then-mayor revivified New York City, quickly becoming, in the words of the
[New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), “the place where Rudy gets his ideas.” [The Public Interest](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/public-interest-legal-foundation/) went further, calling City Journal “the magazine that saved the city.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, City Journal reports news and information regarding urban planning and politics with a right-leaning bias. There is the moderate use of loaded language such as this:
[Making Affordable Housing Even Scarcer](https://www.city-journal.org/rent-regulation-affordable-housing). This article is critical of Democratic Mayor Bill De Blasio’s rent regulations in favor of a more free-market approach. This article is also not sourced with hyperlinks. Although City Journal is a conservative publication, they do not always approve of President Trump’s economic policies: [Trump’s Tariff Gambit](https://www.city-journal.org/html/trumps-tariff-gambit-15971.html). The magazine is also highly critical of Democratic Socialism such as this: [Rebranding Socialism](https://www.city-journal.org/html/rebranding-socialism-10715.html). A quote from the article reads, “Democrats increasingly suggest that the failed ideology is just another word for benevolent government.”
When it comes to science, they proclaim
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) to be exaggerated [It’s the End of the World . . . Sort Of](https://www.city-journal.org/html/it%E2%80%99s-end-world-sort-11689.html). This article does not deny climate change is influenced by humans but questions the severity and the solutions. It is also properly sourced to such sources as [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and [Nature](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nature/). City Journal also offers a controversial view that [gay marriage may lead to polygamy](https://www.city-journal.org/html/i-wed-thee-and-thee-and-thee-12828.html). In general, most stories favor the right and are reasonably sourced.
