[Fort Smith planning, finance directors resign from positions. ](https://www.swtimes.com/news/20190619/fort-smith-planning-finance-directors-resign-from-positions) Most stories are factual and evidence-based, while editorial positions are left and right or, as we call them, neutral.
The
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other national newspapers cover national and international news. Editorially, Op-Eds lean both left and right and in-between.
