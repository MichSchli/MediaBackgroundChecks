Analysis / Bias
In review, the Ron Paul Institute reports news from a Libertarian perspective that frequently utilizes loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Incredible Disappearing Coronavirus – The Narrative Has Failed](http://ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/june/04/incredible-disappearing-coronavirus-the-narrative-has-failed/). Although they often rail against socialism they also frequently report negatively on Neo-Conservatives such as this: [The Media Has Conveniently Forgotten George W. Bush’s Many Atrocities](http://ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/june/04/the-media-has-conveniently-fogotten-george-w-bushs-many-atrocities/). This story is sourced to the factually Mixed [Mises Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/).
Editorially, the Ron Paul Institute advocates for libertarian policy such as free-market capitalism, limited military intervention, marijuana legalization, return to the gold standard, and deregulation. When it comes to science they often deviate from the consensus regarding
[human-influenced](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) climate change [Can the Fed Save Us from Climate Change?](http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/march/02/can-the-fed-save-us-from-climate-change/). Further, they occasionally publish unsubstantiated conspiracy claims such as the Syria chemical attack being a [false flag operation](http://www.ronpaullibertyreport.com/archives/false-flag-ron-paul-says-syrian-chemical-attack-makes-no-sense) as well as promoting the Coronavirus as a hoax (See below). In general, the Ron Paul Institute reports news with a strong libertarian bias that is not always factual.
