Analysis / Bias
The Colorado Free Press is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate local newspaper. All of the websites use the same design template using an old newspaper font for their logos.
The website publishes local news related to Colorado that routinely favors the right, such as this
[Government Schools Are Twisting Your Child’s Conscience](https://coloradofreepress.com/government-schools-are-twisting-your-childs-conscience/). This article does not provide hyperlinked sourcing but relies on video clips from the press conference.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [Help Us Keep Trump On The Ballot](https://coloradofreepress.com/help-us-keep-trump-on-the-ballot/) while denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [The Colorado Communists Are Terrified Of Trump](https://coloradofreepress.com/the-colorado-communists-are-terrified-of-trump/). Based on their support for Trump, they have endorsed his lies regarding election fraud, such as this [BREAKING EXPLOSIVE: SHOCKING ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE TRUTH UNCOVERED!

The Colorado Free Press also promotes
