Analysis / Bias
In review, The Humanist Magazine and website cover topics such as science, religion, media, technology, politics, and popular culture. Articles and headlines do not use loaded emotional language such as this
[Notoriously Humanistic: In Praise of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Jurisprudence](https://thehumanist.com/magazine/november-december-2020/up-front/notoriously-humanistic-in-praise-of-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-jurisprudence). For the most part, all information is sourced properly.
Editorially, The Humanist Magazine does not report on religion or conservatism favorably such as this
[What Would a Humanist Do? Thrilled about Fauci’s Humanism, Scared of Conservative Backlash](https://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2020/commentary/what-would-a-humanist-do-thrilled-about-faucis-humanism-scared-of-conservative-backlash) and this [COVID-19 Relief, Church Bailouts, and Cronyism under Trump](https://thehumanist.com/commentary/covid-19-relief-church-bailouts-and-cronyism-under-trump). While clearly opposed to conservativism, they also do not report favorably on religious Democrats such as this [Bible-Thumping Democrats Should Be a Curiosity](https://thehumanist.com/commentary/bible-thumping-democrats-should-be-a-curiosity). When reporting on science they take pro-science positions on climate change and coronavirus. In general, they report factually with a secular/atheist bias that aligns with the Left-Center.
