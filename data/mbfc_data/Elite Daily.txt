Analysis / Bias
In review, the website primarily publishes news and information geared toward millennial women. Topics include fashion, lifestyle, entertainment, fitness & health, as well as news and occasionally politics. For the most part, headlines match the content of articles and do not utilize loaded emotional language such as this

Here’s What To Know](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/when-should-i-get-tested-for-covid-19-before-thanksgiving-travel-heres-what-to-know-43215030). When it comes to science, they sometimes promote pseudoscience such as [Astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/): [3 Zodiac Signs That’ll Have The Most Romantic Thanksgiving, So Get Ready](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/3-zodiac-signs-thatll-have-the-most-romantic-thanksgiving-so-get-ready-19344081).
Editorially, when covering politics, they often do not use loaded words but usually do not favorably report on conservatives and, in particular, Donald Trump, such as this

Generally, story and editorial selection favor the left and sometimes mildly promote pseudoscience.
