They utilize credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), pro-science sources such as [who.int](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), [Resourcewatch.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/resource-watch/), and sources specific to the country they are covering, such as [moroccoworldnews](http://www.wri.org/blog/2018/04/its-not-just-cape-town-4-shrinking-reservoirs-watch).
Editorially, they hold a left-leaning position in their support for conservation and concern for climate change. Generally, they are evidence-based and factual with a left-leaning advocacy bias.
