Analysis / Bias
USAnetwork.info reports news with a far right bias that uses loaded headlines such as this:
[Bеtо о’Rоurkе Vоws tо Tеаr dоwn еvеry Inch оf thе Bоrdеr Wаll.](https://usanetwork.info/2019/02/17/b%D0%B5t%D0%BE-%D0%BEr%D0%BEurk%D0%B5-v%D0%BEws-t%D0%B5%D0%B0r/) This story is sourced to [Information Liberation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/information-liberation/), which also is a Questionable Source. USANetwork.info has only been in existence for a few months and already has a [false claim](https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/dec/13/blog-posting/website-falsely-claims-united-nations-caught-helpi/) via an IFCN Fact Checker. In general, this is a right biased imposter website that completely lacks credibility.
