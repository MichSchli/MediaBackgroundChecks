Analysis / Bias
The Connecticut Centinal is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate local newspaper. All of the websites use the same design template using an old newspaper font for their logos.
The website publishes local news related to Connecticut that routinely favors the right, such as this
[Connecticut DCF Invites Children To Report On Non-Affirming Parents](https://connecticutcentinal.com/connecticut-dcf-invites-children-to-report-on-non-affirming-parents/). This article does not provide hyperlinked sourcing but relies on video clips from the press conference.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [How Much Is The Ruling Class Willing To Bend The Rules To Stop Trump?](https://connecticutcentinal.com/how-much-is-the-ruling-class-willing-to-bend-the-rules-to-stop-trump/) While denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [Connecticut Democrat Silence On The Biden Corruption](https://connecticutcentinal.com/connecticut-democrat-silence-on-the-biden-corruption/). Based on their support for Trump, they have endorsed his lies regarding election fraud, such as this [“Explosive Revelation: Fani Willis Linked To Massive Election Fraud And Money Laundering RICO Enterprise!”](https://connecticutcentinal.com/explosive-revelation-fani-willis-linked-to-massive-election-fraud-and-money-laundering-rico-enterprise/) This claim is [false](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2023/09/222-contributions-with-zero-donor-information-do-not-prove-there-is-fraud-in-the-campaig-of-fulton-county-district-attorney-fani-willis.html), and there is no evidence of significant election fraud in the 2020 or 2022 elections.
The Connecticut Centinal also promotes
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://connecticutcentinal.com/exposing-who-criminality-and-covid-vaccine-lethality/). In general, this is an imposter website that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
