Analysis / Bias
WhatCulture publishes news and information on entertainment focusing on film, tv, gaming, comics, music and WWE. They also produce quizzes such as this
[Friends Quiz: Who Did It – Chandler, Monica Or Both?](https://whatculture.com/tv/friends-quiz-who-did-it-chandler-monica-or-both-3) When reporting on entertainment they use sensational wording such as this [8 Actors Who Scared Other Actors So Much They Forgot Their Lines](https://whatculture.com/film/8-actors-who-scared-other-actors-so-much-they-forgot-their-lines).
Editorially, they rarely report on politics unless it relates to entertainment such as this
[10 Celebs You Wouldn’t Expect To Be Republicans](https://whatculture.com/offbeat/10-celebs-you-wouldnt-expect-to-be-republicans). We cannot find any evidence of WhatCulture taking editorial stances. In general, they are factual and low biased.
