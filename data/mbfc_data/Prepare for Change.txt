History
Founded in 2013, Prepare for Change is a website/blog that, according to their
[about page](https://prepareforchange.net/about-us/), was created as a voice for the New Society Groups started at the New Society Conference in May 2013. Unfortunately, there aren’t any links regarding this. Further, it is very confusing as to what the EVENT is as they reference this EVENT multiple times without naming it.
They do describe the event on the homepage as this: “It is a cosmic EVENT HORIZON created by big solar waves reaching the Earth from the Galactic Central causing the activation of “The Compression Breakthrough,” this is when the light forces from above the surface of the planet and from below the surface of the planet meet in the middle, that is on the surface of the planet.”
I’ll leave it at that.
Funded by / Ownership
The website does not disclose any information regarding ownership; however, they do have a donation link for funding.
Analysis / Bias
Prepare for Change is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website that is very confusing. While they are preparing for a cosmic event, they are also worried about other conspiracies such as
[Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/): [Chemtrails Represent the ‘No. 1 Health Issue of Our Time’](https://prepareforchange.net/2019/02/26/chemtrails-represent-the-no-1-health-issue-of-our-time/) and Portal Walkers: [Some Ways To Identify If You’re A Portal Walker](https://prepareforchange.net/2019/02/23/some-ways-to-identify-if-youre-a-portal-walker/). In general, Prepare for Change exclusively promotes conspiracies and pseudoscience.
