Analysis / Bias
In review, Far Left Watch is a news blog that specifically attempts to expose Antifa as a violent extremist group. Far Left Watch uses moderate loaded words in headlines such as this:
[Letting the ADL define “hate” is a really bad idea](https://farleftwatch.com/2017/10/11/adl-defines-hate/). All stores published are anti-left and one sided, however all articles are very well sourced to credible media. We also could not find any instances of failed fact checks.
