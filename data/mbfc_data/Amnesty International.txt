Analysis / Bias
The
[core principle of Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International) is a focus on prisoners of conscience, those persons imprisoned or prevented from expressing any opinion other than violence. Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression, Amnesty International’s founding principles included non-intervention on political questions, a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights. [Governments and their supporters have criticized Amnesty’s criticism of their policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International), including those of Australia, the Czech Republic, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iran, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Russia, and the United States, for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments — and other governments critical of Amnesty International — have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty.
The website features a news section that reports on human rights abuses worldwide, such as this
[US military shows appalling disregard for civilians killed in Somalia air strike](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/09/us-military-shows-appalling-disregard-for-civilians-killed-in-somalia-air-strike/) and this [Egypt: Largest wave of mass arrests since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/10/egypt-largest-wave-of-mass-arrests-since-president-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-came-to-power/). These news stories are credible and adequately sourced. Editorially, Amnesty International leans left with promoting [LGBTQ Rights](https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/take-action/w4r-2018-ukraine-vitalina-koval/), support for [climate change activism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and opposition to [far-right regimes](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/greece-police-must-protect-refugees-from-ongoing-far-right-attacks/).
