[Don’t welcome me to my own bloody country](https://xyz.net.au/2023/09/dont-welcome-bloody-country/)” and “ [Better to be a racist than to have abos rule over you](https://xyz.net.au/2023/07/better-to-be-a-racist-than-to-have-abos-rule-over-you/).”

The site also focuses on stories that align with a particular ideological perspective, often critical of mainstream narratives. The website’s apparent endorsement of nationalist and conservative viewpoints places it in the right-biased category.
Regarding science, the website frequently promotes disinformation, such as this related to the Covid-19 vaccine:

In general, this is not a credible source for news and information.
