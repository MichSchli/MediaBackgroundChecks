Analysis / Bias
In review, LADbible publishes sensational videos and entertainment news. Some of these stories and videos are clearly pseudoscience such as this:
[‘Time Traveller’ Knows Who Will Be President In The Year 2045](http://www.ladbible.com/community/weird-time-traveller-from-2045-knows-who-will-be-president-20190327) and this [Vegan Reveals He Ejaculated For First Time In Months After Giving Up Diet](http://www.ladbible.com/news/food-vegan-youtuber-reveals-he-ejaculated-for-first-time-in-months-20190227). The LADbible has also been criticized for [misogyny](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31126002). Although there is plenty of factual stories/videos on this website, there are enough sensational/misleading/fake ones to classify this source as questionable.
In general. LADbible publishes sensational stories that are not always real/true. They don’t really hold a political bias, as they aim to create viral content regardless of whether it is true or not.
