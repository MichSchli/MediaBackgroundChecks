Analysis / Bias
Airwars typically collect data from official military sources and reporters on the ground in Syria and Iraq. They also draw on information sources “including
[NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization), monitoring groups such as the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), international and local news agencies, social media sites including local residents’ groups, in-country researchers, Facebook pages, YouTube footage of incidents, tweets relating to specific events and from military and other government sources.”
The website features an interactive map/chart showing civilian harm from military operations around the world. They also report on individual military operations as they occur, such as this
[USSOM337](https://airwars.org/civilian-casualties/?country=somalia&belligerent=us-forces). Airwars also features investigations such as this [Pentagon annual report declares 85 civilian deaths in recent US actions](https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/pentagon-annual-report-declares-85-civilian-deaths-in-recent-us-actions/). All information reviewed is sourced. In general, Airwars reports fact-based, low-biased information.
