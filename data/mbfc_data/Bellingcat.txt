History
[Founded in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingcat) by British journalist and former blogger Eliot Higgins, Bellingcat publishes the findings of both professional and citizen journalist investigations into war zones, human rights abuses, and the criminal underworld. According to their [about page](https://www.bellingcat.com/about/), “Bellingcat’s innovative approaches to using publicly available data and citizen journalist analysis have been particularly significant for advancing narratives of conflict, crime, and human rights abuses. We have produced investigations on these issues in coordination with partners and allies and expanded our training so that a growing corps of citizen journalists is poised to pursue these stories alongside us.” [Read our profile on the Netherlands media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/netherlands-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Bellingcat uses open source and social media investigation to investigate various subjects, from the shooting down of MH17 to conflicts and corruption around the world. Articles and headlines do not use overtly emotional language and stick to evidence-based reporting such as this
[Unpublished OPCW Douma Correspondence Casts Further Doubt on ‘Doctored’ Report](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/10/26/unpublished-opcw-douma-correspondence-raises-doubts-about-transparency-of-opcw-leaks-promoters/) Claims. All information is properly sourced.
Although Bellingcat does not state an editorial position, they often cover stories that favor the left such as human rights abuses and racism. For example, this story exposes a white supremacist,
[An American White Supremacist’s New Home in Serbia](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/11/18/an-american-white-supremacists-new-home-in-serbia/), and this report focuses on police abuse of US citizens [A New Platform Maps US Police Violence Against Protesters.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/10/29/a-new-platform-maps-us-police-violence-against-protesters/) Further, they frequently cover crimes committed by right-wing groups such as this [Million MAGA March: Unravelling a Violent Viral Video](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/11/18/million-maga-march-unravelling-a-violent-viral-video/).
