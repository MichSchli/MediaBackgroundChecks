In review, NextGov publishes news and information related to technology and government. Articles and headlines contain minimally loaded language such as this
[Governments Need Clear Plans to Respond to Disinformation, Experts Say](https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2020/07/governments-need-clear-plans-respond-disinformation-experts-say/166802/). This story is properly sourced to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [Wired](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/). They also republish articles from other sources such as the [Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) and [Pew](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/).
Editorially, NextGov is mostly focused on technology and government, however, when reporting on formerPresident Donald Trump they present a negative viewpoint
[Trump’s Attacks on Vote-by-Mail Worry Some Election Officials](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2020/06/trumps-attacks-vote-mail-worry-some-election-officials/165865/). In general, story selection is reasonably balanced and factual.
