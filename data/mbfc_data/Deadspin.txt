Analysis / Bias
In review, Deadspin primarily reports sports news and occasional political news via their Concourse section. The Concourse has a left-wing bias in story selection through the use of loaded words in headlines and articles such as this:
[Look At This F*cking Disaster](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/look-at-this-fucking-disaster-1819136255) and this [Moron President Gives Defense Department Four Months To Craft Service Academy Athletics Policy He Himself Axed](https://deadspin.com/moron-president-gives-defense-department-four-months-to-1835891763). This latter story is properly sourced to the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Baltimore Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/baltimore-sun/).
While Deadspin frequently reports negatively on former President Trump, they also do not have a favorable opinion of moderate Democrats such as this:
[Joe Biden Is A Doddering Old Mummy With A Skull Full Of Dumpster Juice](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/joe-biden-is-a-doddering-old-mummy-with-a-skull-full-of-1838094396). In general, news reporting is factual and sometimes sensational, with a clear left-leaning bias.
