Analysis / Bias
In review, American Lookout does not produce original news reporting but instead provides a conservative opinion before quoting or linking to the full article from another source. Some of the sources they link to are the Mixed factual Daily Caller, the Questionable Breitbart,
[RedState](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/), and [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/). Wording denigrates Democrats such as this [Democrats Panic As Suburban Vote Begins Slipping Away From Joe Biden](https://americanlookout.com/democrats-panic-as-suburban-vote-begins-slipping-away-from-joe-biden/). At the same time, other stories glorify Republican President Trump, such as this [President Trump Nominated For Nobel Peace Prize AGAIN For Helping Broker Deal Between Kosovo And Serbia](https://americanlookout.com/president-trump-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize-again-for-helping-broker-deal-between-kosovo-and-serbia/). Generally, all stories favor the right and mostly denigrate the left while consistently using very poor sources who frequently fail fact checks.
American Lookout frequently publishes conspiracies that favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this related to the Clinton body count conspiracy
[Media Ignored THREE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS Of Men Tied To Hillary – WILL TRUMP INVESTIGATE?](https://americanlookout.com/three-suspicious-deaths-of-men-tied-to-hillary-will-trump-investigate/) They also promoted false election fraud conspiracies during the 2020 election, such as this [Trump Supporters Descend On DC For ‘Stop The Steal’ Rally](https://web.archive.org/web/20210304192535/https://americanlookout.com/web/20210304192535/https://americanlookout.com/web/20210304192535/https://americanlookout.com/trump-supporters-descend-on-dc-for-stop-the-steal-rally/). In general, they hold an extreme right bias and frequently publish false or misleading claims.
