Analysis / Bias
In review, Just the Facts promotes that human life begins at conception. Obviously, if cells are dividing it is alive and no one would dispute that. The website emphasizes repeatedly this fact and is detailed in describing Foetal pain. Essentially, this is an anti-abortion website that never mentions abortion. While most of the science on the website is accurate and linked to credible medical journals and textbooks, there is also use of sources that are highly discredited such as the
[The American College of Pediatricians](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-college-of-pediatricians/), which has been labeled a [hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/11/13/meet-anti-lgbt-hate-group-filed-amicus-brief-alabama-supreme-court) due to anti-LGBTQ positions. Further, Just The Facts is listed as a resource on [pro-life organization pages](http://www.rochesterprolife.org/).
