Analysis / Bias
AMIC.ru covers a range of topics, from typical lifestyle and entertainment journalism, such as
[“I want to touch. How the Handsome People of Love Radio helped lovers from the Altai Territory”](https://www.amic.ru/news/hochetsya-prikasatsya-kak-krasavcy-love-radio-pomogli-vlyublennym-iz-altayskogo-kraya-537372) a romantic engagement organized by radio hosts, to more serious political news, like statements made by President Putin regarding military actions such as [“Putin said that it pains him to talk about the events near Kharkov after the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces_The President believes that “only neo-Nazis” can do this.”](https://www.amic.ru/news/putin-zayavil-chto-emu-bolno-govorit-o-sobytiyah-pod-harkovom-posle-othoda-vs-rf-537492)
The tone and approach in the engagement story are typical of lifestyle and entertainment journalism, focusing on positive, feel-good content that likely appeals to a broad audience without apparent political or ideological bias. In contrast, the political news piece about President Putin’s comments on the events near Kharkov reflects a more serious tone and engages with nationalistic and political themes. They use emotionally loaded language to describe Putin’s sentiments (“it pains him,” “these scumbags,” “Only neo-Nazis can do this”), suggesting a narrative that aligns with government perspectives, portraying a defensive stance towards Russian actions and demonizing opposition groups. This type of framing can indicate a pro-government bias, especially in the context of Russian media’s general environment. Regarding sourcing, they cite the

Additionally, the inclusion of pseudoscientific content, such as
[astrological forecasts,](https://www.amic.ru/news/cenite-garmoniyu-astrologicheskiy-prognoz-dlya-vseh-znakov-zodiaka-na-3-fevralya-537463) may impact the perceived credibility of AMIC.ru as a news source. While such content is popular and engages a specific audience segment, it does not adhere to journalistic standards of factual accuracy and evidence-based reporting.
Considering these aspects, AMIC.ru displays a mix of lifestyle, entertainment, and political content, leaning toward pro-government narratives in its political coverage. Non-scientific content like horoscopes further complicates the media outlet’s profile, suggesting a blend of information and entertainment that may not always prioritize factual accuracy.
