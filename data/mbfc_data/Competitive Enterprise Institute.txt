Analysis / Bias
In review, the CEI promotes
[environmental policies](https://cei.org/issues/energy-and-environment) based on limited government regulation and property rights and rejects what they call [“global warming alarmism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).” Headlines and articles typically contain emotionally loaded language that favors the right such as this [Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions](https://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions). This story comes from the questionable climate change denial website [RealClimateScience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/). When not promoting climate change pseudoscience, they advocate for Libertarian positions such as small government and property rights.
Editorially, the primary purpose of the CEI is to mislead on climate change. Scientists have criticized them for publishing misleading information such as
[Scientist to CEI: You Used My Research To “Confuse and Mislead](https://www.factcheck.org/2006/05/scientist-to-cei-you-used-my-research/).” [According](https://ballotpedia.org/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute) to [Ballotpedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ballotpedia/), the “CEI believes that scientific consensus on climate change and global warming were politically rather than scientifically motivated.” Finally, the CEI has a long history of lobbying for the tobacco industry and, since 2011, has [advocated](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3BE2C38531375D3F8525816400519986/$file/16-1128.pdf) for the e-cigarette industry. In general, they are a right-biased advocacy group that sometimes promotes misinformation to advance its agenda.
