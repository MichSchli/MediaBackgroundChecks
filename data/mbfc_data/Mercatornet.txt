Analysis / Bias
In review, MercatorNet uses loaded language both in its headlines and articles. Story selection heavily favors conservative causes and a right-wing political agenda, such as: “
[The left is way more dangerous than loony white supremacists](https://www.mercatornet.com/features/view/the-left-is-way-more-dangerous-than-loony-white-supremacists/20293),” “ [Hilllary Clinton is right: You can be a feminist and pro-life](https://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/hilllary-clinton-is-right-you-can-be-a-feminist-and-pro-life/17909),” and “ [Is Trump the new Constantine?”](https://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/is-trump-the-new-constantine/17800) MercatorNet also sometimes publishes Onion-like satirical articles such as “ [Exclusive: Trump to get Nobel Peace Prize.](https://www.mercatornet.com/features/view/exclusive-trump-to-get-nobel-peace-prize/19896)” MercatorNet typically sources credible media such as [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [Huff Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), as well as national sources like The West Australian and occasionally questionable sources such as [The Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and often denigrate the left. An ad evidences this to subscribe to their newsletter, stating if you are sick of “Woke” News. Generally, this is a right-wing site with high bias and sometimes uses poor sources.
