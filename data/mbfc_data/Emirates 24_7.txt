Analysis / Bias
[Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51762543) is the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and ruler of the Emirate of Dubai.
In review, Dubai Media Inc states its
[mission](http://www.dmi.gov.ae/content/corporate/en-ae/about.html) as to “Provide diverse media services to enhance the image of Dubai & UAE”
Emirates 24/7 publishes articles with headlines such as
[“Mohammed bin Rashid launches New Media Academy”](https://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/mohammed-bin-rashid-launches-new-media-academy-2020-06-15-1.694954) and [“Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Tolerance Award recognises global champions of tolerance”](https://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/mohammed-bin-rashid-al-maktoum-tolerance-award-recognises-global-champions-of-tolerance-2020-02-20-1.692592) that mostly focus on positive coverage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and lacking in any criticism of him.
Emirates 24/7 reports selectively when the issue doesn’t resonate with the ruler, such as news related to his
[daughter](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hopes-of-freeing-dubai-princess-hit-as-spy-friend-and-lawyers-feud-bh82mwr09) and his [wife](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51756984). When it comes to sourcing, Emirates 24/7 often sources through quotes and utilizes the [Emirates News Agency (WAM)](https://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/world-security-introduces-smart-helmet-to-detect-covid-19-infection-in-uae-2020-06-15-1.694940), which is the official news agency of the United Arab Emirates.
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a positive tone,
[“Donald Trump becomes grandfather for 10th time”](https://www.emirates247.com/news/donald-trump-becomes-grandfather-for-10th-time-2019-08-21-1.688668) and [“Dubai Ruler receives Ivanka Trump at GWFD 2020”](https://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/dubai-ruler-receives-ivanka-trump-at-gwfd-2020-2020-02-17-1.692452), whereas their coverage of former Democratic President Barack Obama was often negative in tone [“Americans lose faith in Obama](https://www.emirates247.com/americans-lose-faith-in-obama-2010-07-13-1.265941).” This story is a slide show that highlights the high unemployment rate under Obama. In general, the news is reported factually; however, due to censorship, there is never negative coverage of the ruling family resulting in pro-state propaganda.
