Analysis / Bias
In review, Media Matters frequently uses emotionally loaded words that favor the left and denigrate the right such as this:
[Fox News bashes Bernie Sanders and misleads viewers about his policies after his Fox town hall](https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2019/04/16/fox-news-bashes-bernie-sanders-and-misleads-viewers-about-his-policies-after-his-fox-town-hall/223470). This report is properly sourced to credible media outlets and direct quotes. Here is another example of an emotionally charged headline designed to favor the left: [The insane, toxic Trump adulation of Jeanine Pirro](https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/03/08/insane-toxic-trump-adulation-jeanine-pirro/219577). Although biased in wording, this story is again properly sourced to [OpenSecrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and the FEC. [On 11/20/23](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4320053-elon-musks-x-files-lawsuit-against-media-matters/), a lawsuit was filed against Media Matters by X/Twitter for defamation after publishing a report on how ads for major advertisers appear next to posts with antisemitic rhetoric. Media Matters responded with this statement: “This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X’s critics into silence. Media Matters stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court.”
In general, Media Matters’s sole purpose is to paint the right negatively while positively reporting on the left. Typically, they use proper sources and usually keep information in context, though opinions are clearly left-biased.
