Analysis / Bias
Journal of Biomedical Science is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to biomedical science. The journal primarily publishes research like this
[mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics: an in-depth survey of current and upcoming clinical applications](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-023-00977-5).
BioMed Central (BMC) is an open-access publisher of scientific journals. There are two types of Open Access Journals, legitimate and predatory, both of which charge the author for publication.
[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. BioMed Central is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, BMC journals have been criticized for [retracting numerous studies](https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/mass-retraction-35728) due to fake peer reviews or poor methodology.
Although BMC has retracted some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed, the Journal of Biomedical Science publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
