Analysis / Bias
In review, Buzzfeed News primarily publishes original reported news and investigations. News is broken down into sections such as Arts & Entertainment, Inequality, LGBTQ, Opinion, and Politics. Buzzfeed News is completely different from their parent site, which generally produces clickbait-type stores shared on Social Media. On the other hand, Buzzfeed News produces quality news reporting that is often investigative such as this
[He Was In The Wrong Place At The Wrong Time When Biden Started Letting Asylum-Seekers Back Into The US. Now All He Can Do Is Wait.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/asylum-seekers-stuck-in-mexico-wait-for-biden?ref=bfnsplash) Story selection is usually favorable to the left.
Buzzfeed News utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines, such as
[“Trump Excluded Democrats From A Lunch Meeting On The Shutdown”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lissandravilla/shutdown-government-trump-white-house) and [“The US Envoy On ISIS, Brett McGurk, Quit In Protest Over Trump’s Withdrawal From Syria](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/brett-mcgurk-resigns-trump-syria).” They typically source to themselves when it comes to sourcing; however, they also utilize credible sources such as the [Des Moines Register](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-des-moines-register/) and [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
