Analysis / Bias
Student News Daily (SND) is a site that provides, as the name suggests, current news and information to students. It provides almost no original content but instead links to stories from a wide range of external news sources as diverse as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and [The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/). Additionally, SND provides questions for the student after the articles are intended to promote critical thinking on the issues. Due to the diverse variety of news sources, the articles’ factual content and political bias range from very high to very low. Although there is a slight preference for Right Center news sources, SND’s bias is most evident in its Recommended Sites list. The list of links is primarily Right Center, Right Bias, or government fact sites. This, coupled with the slight Right Center slant in the article selection, earns SND a Right-Center rating.
