Analysis / Bias
The Philippine Star features sensationalistic headlines and articles and often uses emotionally loaded words. For example, the editorial
[“National embarrassment”](https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2023/03/02/2248582/editorial-national-embarrassment) with a quote that reads, “Airport security screening is a serious matter. Leaving the task to amateurs, thieves and giggly fangirls can only lead to national embarrassment.”
On opinion pieces, the paper leans towards the left with the choice of words in headlines and articles: “‘
[Unfazed by surveys and the elite, De Guzman determined to usher in worker-led Malacañang.”](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/02/09/2159642/unfazed-surveys-and-elite-de-guzman-determined-usher-worker-led-malacaang) A quote from the article, “While lagging in surveys behind his more affluent and popular opponents with bigger funds and electoral machinery, the former factory worker says that the common folk who continue to shower him with their trust wills him on.” The article favors labor leader and socialist labor rights activist Leody de Guzman.
The Philippine Star also republishes articles from credible sources such as
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/); this article is critical of President Duterte, [“‘Shoot them dead’: Duterte in his own words”](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/06/28/2191487/shoot-them-dead-duterte-his-own-words) and makes a list of his words: “Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who steps down on Thursday, was infamous for his foul-mouthed tirades, off-colour jokes, and threats to kill people.” The paper also publishes articles about climate change and its effects on the country, such as [“Philippine provinces among areas at most risk from climate damage.”](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/climate-and-environment/2023/03/01/2248552/philippine-provinces-among-areas-most-risk-climate-damage) However, most articles do not contain hyperlinked sourcing. In general, the Philippine star is usually fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
