[offline temporarily](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/8chan-briefly-got-back-online-with-same-cdn-used-by-neo-nazi-daily-stormer/) when their service provider, [BitMitigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epik_(domain_registrar)), was cut off by their cloud infrastructure provider; the site found another provider.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Stormer is a neo-nazi, white supremacist hate website. The Daily Stormer frequently
[promotes](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/the-making-of-an-american-nazi/544119/) Holocaust denial and even advocates exterminating the Jews. The website also features a countdown clock that shows when Whites will be the minority in the USA. When not promoting Antisemitism, they frequently publish propaganda in support of Racism, Islamophobia, Anti-LGBTQ, and advocacy for Men’s rights.
Politically, the Daily Stormer and Andrew Anglin support Donald Trump,
[stating](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/11890531/The-white-supremacists-and-racists-flocking-to-Donald-Trump.html), “vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who represents our interests.” The Daily Stormer has even been [criticized](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/03/10/blog-wars-daily-stormer-and-its-racist-frenemies) by white nationalist websites such as Stormfront and Counter-Currents that have taken issue with what they see as lowbrow coverage.
