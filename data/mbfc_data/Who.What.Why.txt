Analysis / Bias
WhoWhatWhy publishes news and journalism in the following categories: politics, justice, economy, science, culture, and opinion. The website also hosts podcasts and videos. Articles and headlines sometimes use moderately emotional language such as this
[Why Cuomo’s New Judge Has New York Progressives Fuming](https://whowhatwhy.org/justice/criminal-justice/why-cuomos-new-judge-has-new-york-progressives-fuming/). While this story is well written and detailed, the only source is a video news story from a local NYC outlet.
Story selection favors the progressive left, such as this
[The Money Movement Exposes Fossil Fuel Financing](https://whowhatwhy.org/science/environment/the-money-movement-exposes-fossil-fuel-financing/). Op-eds strongly favor the left with stories such as [Biden Must Clean Up the Trump Pardons](https://whowhatwhy.org/opinion/biden-must-clean-up-the-trump-pardons/). The website also publishes cartoons that usually mock the GOP and former president Trump such as this [Al-Qaeda Would Have Loved a Champion Like the GOP](https://whowhatwhy.org/opinion/al-qaeda-would-have-loved-a-champion-like-the-gop/). When it comes to science, they support the consensus on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but frequently promote [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) such as this [Why Is the EPA Delaying Release of Glyphosate Information?](https://whowhatwhy.org/politics/government-integrity/epa-delaying-release-glyphosate-information/) In general, most news stories are fact-based and have a left-leaning bias; however, they sometimes publish articles promoting pseudoscience.
