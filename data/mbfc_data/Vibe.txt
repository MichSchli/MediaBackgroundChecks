History
[Founded in 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_(magazine)), Vibe is an American music and entertainment magazine (print until 2014) founded by producer [Quincy Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones). Vibe is currently only available as a website at vibe.com. They primarily report on R&B and hip hop music artists, actors, and other entertainers. The website lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page, discloses an editor, and incorrectly states ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
Vibe is owned by Eldridge Industries, while the website states it is a subsidiary of the
[Prometheus Global Media, LLC](https://pusgm.com/). This is incorrect as Valence Media is now the publisher, owned by Eldridge Industries. Valence Media also publishes Billboard, [The Hollywood Reporter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hollywood-reporter/), SPIN, and Stereogum. Revenue is derived through advertisements.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Vibe mainly publishes original news and interviews with R&B, Hip Hop artists, and entertainers. Article and headlines feature moderately loaded emotional language, such as this
[Wale Shows Support For Megan Thee Stallion As She Heals From Shooting Injury](https://www.vibe.com/2020/07/wale-shows-support-for-megan-thee-stallion). This story is primarily sourced from social media. Vibe also covers national news from the [Associated Press](https://www.vibe.com/2020/07/wale-shows-support-for-megan-thee-stallion) and original writings from reporters.
When covering politics, they do not offer strong opinions; however, story selection leans left as stories frequently center on racial justice and equality, such as this
[Bail Reform, Civil Rights, And Why Hip-Hop Journalists Need To Get Involved](https://www.vibe.com/2020/01/bail-reform-hip-hop-journalists). Vibe generally reports mostly factually with a moderate left-leaning bias in story selection.
