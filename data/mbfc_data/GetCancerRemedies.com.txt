Analysis / Bias
In review, GetCancerRemedies.com publishes news regarding alternative medicine, supposed cancer-fighting foods, and
[Big Pharma conspiracy theories.](https://getcancerremedies.com/2018/10/08/big-pharma-co-has-license-suspended-as-vaccine-sterilizes-500000-girls/) For example, this article claims that Cilantro is a miracle cleanser in removing heavy metals from the body: [How To Remove 80 % of Heavy Metals From The Body In 42 Days With This Plant](https://getcancerremedies.com/2018/12/07/how-to-remove-80-of-heavy-metals-from-the-body-in-42-days-with-this-plant/). This of course is not true according to a study published in Scientific World Journal: “Less encouragingly, in a recent trial in 3- to 7-year old children exposed to lead, a cilantro extract was as effective as placebo in increasing renal excretion.”
GetCancerRemedies.com also spreads Anti-Vaxx propaganda such as this:
[Doctor Blows Whistle on Flu Shot: ‘It’s Designed to Spread Cancer’](https://getcancerremedies.com/2018/08/28/doctor-blows-whistle-on-flu-shot-its-designed-to-spread-cancer/), which simply is not grounded in evidence and is sourced to medical quack [Joseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/). In general, there is very little credible information to be found on this website.
