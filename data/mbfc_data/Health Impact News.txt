Analysis / Bias
In review, Health Impact News publishes health-related news stories that they state are alternative. Our analysis concurs that they are certainly an alternative to conventional science and medicine. They are fiercely
[anti-vaccine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) with articles such as this: [Dangerous Vaccines Found to Cause Symptoms of Shaken Baby Syndrome](http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/dangerous-vaccines-found-to-cause-symptoms-of-shaken-baby-syndrome/).

They also routinely publish [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) such as [this](http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/glyphosate-pathways-to-modern-diseases/). They are also purveyors of misinformation regarding [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) and Geoengineering such as [Covert Chemical Geoengineering Programs – A Real Threat to Public Health.](http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/covert-chemical-geoengineering-programs-a-real-threat-to-public-health/)
