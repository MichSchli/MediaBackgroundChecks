Analysis / Bias
In review, Derf Magazine appropriately provides a disclaimer on each page that reads “All stories are fictional and satirical and should not in any way be construed as fact.” Stories generally poke fun at Ohio and the surrounding area, however they also produce political satire that targets both sides such as this poking fun at Trump:
[Donald Trump admits to killing puppies, rises 6 points in polls](http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/donald-trump-killing-puppies) and this going after Bill Clinton, [Chelsea Clinton’s bridesmaids report mysterious dress stains](http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/chelsea-clinton-dress-stains).
