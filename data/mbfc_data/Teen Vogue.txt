History
Teen Vogue was a US print magazine
[launched in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Vogue) as a sister publication to Vogue, targeted at teenage girls. Like Vogue, it included stories about fashion and celebrities. Since 2015, following a steep decline in sales, the magazine cut back on its print distribution in favor of online content, which has grown significantly. In November 2017, it was announced Teen Vogue would cease its print edition and continue as an online-only publication as part of a new round of cost cuts. Since 2017, Teen Vogue has also focused on politics, which tends to lean left.

Analysis / Bias
In review, for the most part, Teen Vogue is still a style magazine geared toward a younger female audience, however, in recent years they have become more politically oriented with articles such as this:
[Attorney General Jeff Sessions Joined a “Lock Her Up!” Chant at a Conservative Teen Conference](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-joined-lock-her-up-chant-at-conservative-teen-conference). In general, these political stories almost always exclusively favor the left. Another example relates to Donald Trump, which they do not report favorably: [Trump’s Title X Rules Could Lead to More Harassment at Abortion Clinics](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/trumps-title-x-rules-could-lead-to-more-harassment-at-abortion-clinics). This story, like most on the website, is properly sourced to the Health and Human Services website as well as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, Teen Vogue is generally opposed to the Trump administration and conservatism. For example, they have an entire section dedicated to identity and wellness, which also leads to the pseudoscience of horoscopes. When it comes to hard science, they support the consensus of science with
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). On [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) they are neutral, and with natural cures, they again produce some questionable and scientific information.
