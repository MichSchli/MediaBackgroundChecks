Analysis / Bias
In 2020
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Saudi Arabia 170/180 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/saudi-arabia) stating that “Saudi Arabia permits no independent media. The authorities keep Saudi journalists under close surveillance, even when they are abroad, as Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in Istanbul in October 2018 illustrated.”
Al Hayat publishes articles with strong emotionally loaded language such as
[“pro-regime militants killed by rocket fire in Damascus”.](http://www.alhayat.com/article/4579722/%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-15-%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82) In their headlines pertaining to national and international news they use minimally loaded emotional language such as and [“Trump withdraws from nuclear deal.”](http://www.alhayat.com/article/4579664/%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A) They typically utilize credible sources such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). However, some articles are heavily quoted without linking the story to sources. Al-Hayat does not have an English version, therefore this review was conducted via English translation. In general, they publish pro-state propaganda.
