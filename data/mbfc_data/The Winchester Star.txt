[If shutdown drags on, region may suffer economic hit](https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/if-shutdown-drags-on-region-may-suffer-economic-hit/article_a0522b92-ef78-53cd-8f07-f3b2ccf893a3.html). The national news is syndicated via the least biased [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).

The Opinion page has a section called “
[Our View](https://www.winchesterstar.com/opinions/our_view/)” that presumably reflects the editorial positions of the newspaper. The stories in this section consistently lean right with headlines like this: [Trump a one-termer, by choice?](https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/trump-a-one-termer-by-choice/article_be5061a1-5f60-53b0-8a9e-efb0e04c08e5.html) Further, Ogden Newspapers Inc. has [faced scrutiny](https://www.rawstory.com/2010/04/newspaper-chain-astroturfs-editorials/) for directing its newspapers to endorse Republican candidates.
