Analysis / Bias
In review, Not Allowed To publishes clickbait news and headlines designed to be shared on social media. The stories on Not Allowed To are clearly not true and satirical, however, they never disclaim that they are, which forces us to rate them as questionable due to a lack of transparency. For example, this story
[MAN WHO DIED OF CORONAVIRUS MIRACULOUSLY RESURRECTS THREE DAYS LATER](https://notallowedto.com/man-who-died-of-coronavirus-miraculously-resurrects-three-days-later/), is certainly 100% satire, but there is not an indication of such.
