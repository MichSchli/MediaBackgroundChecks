History
Launched in November 2011, Wings Over Scotland is a Scottish commentary political blog founded by activist and long-term supporter of Scottish Independence,
[Stuart Campbell](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13170835._The_bottom_line_is_I_don_t_particularly_care_if_people_don_t_want_to_be_associated_with_us_/). According to the Wings Over Scotland [about page](https://wingsoverscotland.com/about/), their main focus is on media, and they also offer commentary and analysis. Wings Over Scotland [publicly supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_endorsements_in_the_Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) a YES vote on a referendum for Scottish Independence.
Stuart Campbell has a history of
[insulting people](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13166108.yes-campaign-distances-controversial-website/) and, in 2017, made [homophobic comments](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/wings-over-scotland-demands-aps10k-over-kezia-dugdale-column-1449423). In 2019, his Twitter account was [permanently suspended](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18108825.wings-scotland-permanently-banned-twitter-violations-hateful-conduct-policy/) for violations of the platform’s rules against hateful conduct.
In May 2020, Twitter permanently suspended
[two more of Campbell’s Twitter accounts](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/twitter-bans-stuart-campbells-wings-over-scotland-accounts-2846210), including his personal one, for violations of the platform’s rules against hateful conduct, platform manipulation, and spam. Mr. Campbell reacted by promoting a conspiracy theory calling the social media platform “an unaccountable and unelected foreign corporation serving the interests of a massive right-wing pharmacological lobby.” [Read our profile on UK media and government](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
First, we need to look at the political parties that favor and oppose
[Scotland’s independence:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence) “Scottish independence is supported most prominently by left-leaning parties such as the [Scottish National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party) (SNP), but the Scottish Green Party, the Scottish Socialist Party also favors Scottish Independence. On the other hand, The Conservative Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, UK Independence Party (UKIP), and the British National Party (BNP) oppose Scottish independence.”
In review, Wings Over Scotland uses loaded words that typically favor Nationalist left-center political views on headlines and articles such as:
[“Fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake](https://wingsoverscotland.com/fakers-gonna-fake-fake-fake-fake-fake/),” [“The Great Whiteout,”](https://wingsoverscotland.com/the-great-whiteout/) and “ [Our Friends In Europa.”](https://wingsoverscotland.com/our-friends-in-europa/) Wings Over Scotland does not source well. Typically, they source directly to themselves, only occasionally using credible media such as [The Independent ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/)and [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/). Still, typically they use these sources to criticize them for their coverage of Scottish Independence.
Wings Over Scotland has also promoted transphobic messaging such as this
[ The heresy of biology](https://wingsoverscotland.com/the-heresy-of-biology/). In general, Wings Over Scotland has a history of publishing controversial content that has resulted in Twitter Bans and lawsuits. Further, they have promoted conspiracy theories as well as utilized hate speech on several occasions. For this reason, we rate them Questionable.
