History
[Founded in 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Star_(British_newspaper)) as the Daily Worker, The Morning Star is a left-wing British daily tabloid newspaper with a focus on social, political, and trade union issues. Articles and comment columns are contributed by writers from socialist, communist, social democratic, green and religious perspectives. According to their [Support Us](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/page/support-us) page, they state: “The Morning Star is a reader-owned co-operative and unique as a lone socialist voice in a sea of corporate media. We offer a platform for those who would otherwise never be listened to, coverage of stories that would otherwise be buried. We are one of the few media organizations that are honest about the perspective it represents: that of the labor movement and working people all over the world.” [Read our profile on UK Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Morning Star disclaims they are a socialist tabloid and therefore are transparent in their motivations. Stories often contain highly emotional wording that denigrates the right such as this
[Johnson pressured to apologise for decades of sexist, homophobic and racist remarks](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/johnson-pressured-to-come-clean-over-decades-of-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-remarks). This is an op-ed that is not labeled as such and does not provide hyperlinked sourcing. In another story, there is support for the left-leaning Labour Party, [Labour announces policies to expand green space and industry](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/labour-announces-labour-policies-expand-green-space-and-industry). Again there is not any hyperlinked sourcing. We understand this is a print newspaper, but something detailing where the information is coming from would be helpful.
Editorially, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right. In general, there is a poor use of sourcing, and far-left bias is presented through sensationalized headlines.
