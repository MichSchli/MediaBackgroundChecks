Analysis / Bias
The primary purpose of the Anya Vien website is to sell health and nutrition-related products. This is accomplished by publishing articles on health, nutrition, and wellness that usually link to an Amazon affiliate link or products in their online store. Articles and headlines use minimally biased wording such as this
[SIMPLE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR DETOX DRINK TO BOOST THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH](https://anyavien.com/simple-apple-cider-vinegar-detox-drink-to-boost-the-immune-system-and-improve-your-health/).
Anya Vien consistently promotes false information and pseudoscience, especially when it relates to the dangers of certain foods. For example, this article
[MCDONALD’S USES LIVING TOXIC PESTICIDES ON POTATOES THAT MUST “GAS OFF” FOR SIX WEEKS BEFORE THEY ARE SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION,](https://archive.fo/FV3Cu#selection-195.0-195.123) which does not contain a single hyperlink to support the claim. [It also is not true](https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/the-right-chemistry-myths-about-mcdonalds-fries-instant-ramen-noodles). The website also promotes the debunked claims that Fluoride is harmful [TOP 11 BRANDS OF BOTTLED WATER THAT ARE FULL OF TOXIC FLUORIDE](https://archive.fo/22Q8t#selection-197.0-197.62). Finally, since the Covid-19 pandemic, they have frequently promoted false information, such as claiming Covid-19 is not worse than the flu and [miracle treatments for viruses](https://anyavien.com/4-essential-oils-for-boosting-the-immune-system/) such as [essential oils](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-essential-oils/), which are considered a pseudoscience. In general, this website promotes quackery-level pseudoscience to sell products.
