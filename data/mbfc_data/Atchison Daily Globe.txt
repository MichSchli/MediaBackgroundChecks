Analysis / Bias
The Atchison Daily Globe website publishes news for the greater Atchison, Kansas area. Local news features original reporting with minimal bias, such as this:
[Early Voting ongoing this week at the courthouse](https://www.atchisonglobenow.com/news/early-voting-ongoing-this-week-at-the-courthouse/article_6bda6bf0-0799-11ed-8ed5-430696ce86b5.html). The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other large, credible media outlets cover national and international news.
Editorially, they produce op-eds under the Voices tag with a reasonable balance of opinions; however, more favor the right such as this
[Bidenâ€™s budget blunder](https://www.atchisonglobenow.com/voices/biden-s-budget-blunder/article_4d70e4ea-eb0d-11eb-9948-e394723fb012.html). In general, they report news factually and with a slight right-leaning bias.
