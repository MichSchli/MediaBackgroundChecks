Analysis / Bias
In review, the Revolutionary Communist Party of the USA ultimately advocates the abolition of capitalism in favor of communism. The website features articles that are negative toward the conservative right, such as this:
[Where did the American fascist movement behind Trump and Pence come from?](https://revcom.us/a/673/three-questions-en.html) and [Why did 70+ million people vote for this genocidal racist, male supremacist, “America First” fascist, Trump? “Is there hope for white people?”](https://revcom.us/a/673/three-questions-en.html).
Editorially, they consistently advocate for a “new synthesis” of communism that it considers a scientific advancement of
[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%E2%80%93Maoism). The website promotes ideas associated with the left, such as anti-racism, pro-LGBTQ rights, and strong support for labor. They also promote pro-science positions on climate change and COVID-19. Revcom has identified what it calls “ [the 5 Stops](http://revolutionbooksla.blogspot.com/2019/01/friday-michael-slate-show-as-new-year.html),” which it says are social contradictions under capitalism that can only be ended by revolution: white supremacy, patriarchy, and anti-LGBT discrimination, anti-immigrant persecution, imperialist war, and environmental degradation. Revcom also emphasizes women’s liberation and says it can only be achieved under communism.
