History
[Founded in August 2018,](http://whois.domaintools.com/usnationalnews.org) US National News is a far-left website that appears to publish most content from Andrew Simpson, who does not have a bio or any other information regarding who he is. Other authors, similarly, do not have any info attached to them. According to their [about page](http://usnationalnews.org/about/), they claim “at US National News we focus on high-quality reporting, analysis, opinion, and truth. We bring you up-to-the-minute news on politics and the political state-of-play at home and abroad.” The domain for this website is registered in Canada.

Funded by / Ownership
US National News does not disclose ownership on the website and is funded through onsite advertising that is excessive with pop up video ads. (Nothing wrong with that, but it slows the website to a point where you simply want to close it)
Analysis / Bias
In review, US National News publishes stories that are almost always anti-right and/or anti-Trump. There is excessive use of loaded emotional language and sensational click bait headlines such as these:
[Anonymous Tip From Restaurant Server Exposes Trump’s Favorite Meal, This Is So Disgusting](http://usnationalnews.org/anonymous-tip-from-restaurant-server-exposes-trumps-favorite-meal-this-is-so-disgusting/) [Legal Scholar Comes Forward With Proof That Trump Is “Literally Acting As An Agent Of Russia”](http://usnationalnews.org/legal-scholar-comes-forward-with-proof-that-trump-is-literally-acting-as-an-agent-of-russia/) [Trump Attacks Reporters In Closed-Door Meeting, Here Are The Terrible Things He Said](http://usnationalnews.org/trump-attacks-reporters-in-closed-door-meeting-here-are-the-terrible-things-he-said/)– The summary for this article is: “This man is completely unhinged.”
US National News sources the content of their articles, however, most seem to come directly from the Mixed factual
[DC Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dc-tribune/). In general, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right. 90% or more of the stories on this website are about President Trump and negative in tone.
