Analysis / Bias
According to a Politico
[interview](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/vox-ezra-klein-110276) with the editor, Ezra Klein, Klein describes their goal as “to use technology to improve readers’ experience and understanding of events.” Vox has introduced [Vox Card Stacks](https://www.vox.com/cards), and with those cards, they organize information, in index card format, about all kinds of topics in the news with in-depth details but in a summary form. Some examples are: [“Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine”](https://www.vox.com/cards/israel-palestine) and [“The spread of marijuana legalization, explained.”](https://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization) Vox also has a feature called [StoryStream](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/31/16585386/catalan-independence-spain-referendum), where they provide real-time updates to news stories.
In review, Vox looks at the issues from a progressive liberal perspective, and there is also an anti-Trump tone in their
[reporting.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17467706/trump-inspector-general-fox-news) Therefore, the majority of stories are pro-left and anti-right. Further, Vox publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as [“Are Democrats brave enough to run a woman against Donald Trump?”](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/16/17459246/democrats-liberals-franken-sexual-harassment-trump-2020-presidential-candidates) and “ [The most depressing energy chart of the year- Coal has got to go”](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/15/17467164/energy-chart-renewables-coal-climate-change) When it comes to sourcing, Vox typically utilizes credible sources such as the [NY Times,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). In general, the news is reported factually and holds a moderate left-leaning bias editorially.
