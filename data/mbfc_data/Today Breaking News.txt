Analysis / Bias
In review, Today Breaking News does not publish original content, but rather summarizes news articles and offers far right biased opinions. Articles often contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[Breaking: State Department Finds Hillary Guilty](https://www.chicagodaily.pro/breaking-state-department-finds-hillary-guilty/). This story is copy and pasted (plagiarized) from a source called the [Bearded Patriot](https://thebeardedpatriot.com/breaking-state-department-finds-hillary-guilty/). In another story, [Ilhan Omarâ€™s Daughter Vows To Boot Trump From Office Unless He Changes Course of Admin,](https://www.chicagodaily.pro/ilhan-omars-daughter-vows-to-boot-trump-from-office-unless-he-changes-course-of-admin/) there is a complete absence of hyperlinked sourcing. In general, story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left while not offering sources for their information. In other words, this is not a credible website on any level.
