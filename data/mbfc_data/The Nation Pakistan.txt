Analysis / Bias
[Pakistan is ranked](https://rsf.org/en/pakistan) 157 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Press Freedom Index from the organization Reporters without Borders. According to [Reporter’s Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/), “The influence of this military “establishment,” which cannot stand independent journalism, has increased dramatically since Imran Khan became prime minister in July 2018. There have been many cases of brazen censorship in which the military have used one or other of its methods for exercising pressure.” [Nawa-i-Waqt Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawa-i-Waqt)’s position in Pakistan’s media is defined as [well-established center-right and nationalist credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawa-i-Waqt).
The Nation Pakistan publishes news and opinion articles covered national and world news. National news uses minimally loaded language such as this
[High flood flow in Chenab after India releases water](https://nation.com.pk/13-Jul-2021/high-flood-flow-in-chenab-after-india-releases-water). This story, like most, does not rely on hyperlinked sourcing. When reporting on world news, they often republish from poor sources such as the Questionable [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/) and the factually mixed [Anadolu News Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anadolu-agency/). Further, they also label some international news as being published by “Agencies” without actually naming the agencies.
Editorially, the paper aligns with the right and supports current right-leaning prime minister Imran Khan
[PM Imran Khan launches initiative to feed poor](https://nation.com.pk/11-Mar-2021/pm-imran-khan-launches-initiative-to-feed-poor). In general, they favor the government of Pakistan ( [not much choice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pakistan-media-profile/)) and hold a right-leaning editorial bias. Although the news appears to be reported factually, they often use poor sources for international news.
