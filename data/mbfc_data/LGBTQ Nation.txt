Analysis / Bias
In review, LGBTQ Nation promotes global gay rights through reporting of news on politics, elections, life, and health. News reporting often contains loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this:
[GOP lawmaker’s extremely conservative sex ed bill is dead. She blames LGBTQ activism.](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/01/gop-lawmakers-extremely-conservative-sex-ed-bill-dead-blames-lgbtq-activism/) and this [Serial rapist’s mom says he had “a good Christian family” that does “not believe in homosexuality.”](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/01/serial-rapists-mom-says-good-christian-family-not-believe-homosexuality/) This story is properly sourced to the [Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/). Story selection always favors the left and often focuses on hate crimes and discrimination against LGBTQ, such as this [Two LGBT students are suing an evangelical college for expelling them](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/01/two-lgbt-students-suing-evangelical-college-expelling/).
Editorially, LGBTQ Nation frequently reports negatively on
[conservatives](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/01/christian-conservative-leader-franklin-graham-going-visit-key-west-wrote-letter/) and the former Trump administration, such as this: [Trump’s Greenville rally is a dangerous omen for America’s future](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/07/trumps-greenville-rally-dangerous-omen-americas-future/). In general, LGBTQ Nation routinely denigrates the right and reports favorably on the left.
