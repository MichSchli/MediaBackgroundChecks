Analysis / Bias
In review, Cosmopolitan Magazine and the website feature stories on relationships, sex, health, careers, self-improvement, celebrities, fashion, horoscopes, and beauty. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional language such as this
[I’m Moving My Family to Canada to Save My Black Son From America](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a33576362/family-moving-from-to-canada-black-lives-matter/). They also regularly publish pseudoscience such as [horoscopes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/horoscopes/) and information on [Astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/).
Editorially, Cosmopolitan reports negatively on conservatives and former President Donald Trump, such as this
[Julia Louis-Dreyfus Fully Roasted Trump During the DNC](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a33665561/julia-louis-dreyfus-roasts-trump-dnc/). They also endorse political candidates with the criteria that they are pro-choice. Other [criteria for endorsement](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/the-new-cosmo-love-sex-politics-110586) include equal pay laws, legal abortion, free contraceptives, gun control, and opposition voter identification laws. Cosmo generally reports news and information with a strong left-leaning bias that sometimes promotes [pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/) and is not always factual.
