Analysis / Bias
In review, 911Truth is a conspiracy website that promotes the idea that the official narrative given by the Government and Media regarding the 9/11 attacks is not the truth. For example, 911Truth claims that the attacks were a
[“synthetic”](http://911truth.org/mission/) event caused by the “US and global system of warfare and fraud, of secret government and hidden economics, of power concentrated in the hands of the vanishingly few.” An example conspiracy headline reads [The conspiracies that won’t go away: Brother of 9/11 victim claim the US-orchestrated the atrocity as new study shows it was impossible that the third tower collapsed from fire](http://911truth.org/9-11-conspiracy-theories-victim-claims-us-orchestrated-atrocity/). Sourcing for this article comes from the Questionable [Daily Mail](http://911truth.org/9-11-conspiracy-theories-victim-claims-us-orchestrated-atrocity/) and the rest from 911Truth.org itself. In another article, [New Obama Executive Order Seizes US Infrastructure and Citizens for Military Preparedness](http://911truth.org/new-obama-executive-order-seizes-u-s-infrastructure-and-citizens-for-military-preparedness/); the source is the [Activist Post](http://911truth.org/new-obama-executive-order-seizes-u-s-infrastructure-and-citizens-for-military-preparedness/), a known conspiracy website. Other sources used are the Conspiracy/Pseudoscience website [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) and the conspiracy website [Prison Planet](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prison-planet/). 911Truth also sources from more mainstream sources such as [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/) and [Raw Story](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/raw-story/).
In general, 911Truth reports mostly unproven hypotheses using poor sources but also publishes factual information related to 9/11.
