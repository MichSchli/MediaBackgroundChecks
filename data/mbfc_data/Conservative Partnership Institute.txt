Funded by / Ownership
The Conservative Partnership Institute, Inc. is an IRS-approved section 501(c)(3) public charity; however, they lack transparency as they do not openly disclose donations and funding.
[According](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Conservative_Partnership_Institute) to the left-leaning [Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), CPI has connections to the Council for National Policy, a Christian Right organization of funders and activists. Sourcewatch also reports it received funding from the Bradly Foundation and Donor’s Trust.
Analysis / Bias
According to a description of the organization, they state “CPI does not take positions on legislation or engage in lobbying or partisan campaign activities. All programs are established to promote conservative policies and principles and are not based on considerations of any political party.”
Although they claim not to take positions, the news reported on the website clearly takes right biased positions with news items such as this
[GOP senators roll for Biden nominees; border in flames](https://www.cpi.org/post/compass-gop-senators-roll-for-biden-nominees-border-in-flames). In this story, CPI sources properly with hyperlinks; however, some of the sources used are classified as questionable, such as [The Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/) and a Youtube video.
Editorially, all stories favor the conservative right, with many focusing on immigration such as this
[Democrats respond to border crisis with more incentives](https://www.cpi.org/post/compass-democrats-respond-to-border-crisis-with-more-incentives). Unlike other stories reviewed, this one is reasonably sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/); however, much of the sourcing comes from the factually mixed [American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/). In general, most news is reported factually and with a strong right-leaning conservative bias.
