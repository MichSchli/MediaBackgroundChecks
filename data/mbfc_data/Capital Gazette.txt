Analysis / Bias
In review, The Capital Gazette publishes news stories related to the Maryland capital Annapolis and the surrounding area. The Capital Gazette uses emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Democratic primary results rattle foundation of Mike Miller’s presidency of Maryland Senate”](http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/government/bs-md-primary-miller-20180627-story.html) and [“Maryland civil rights advocates rally, denounce Supreme Court decision to uphold Trump’s travel ban.”](http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/nation_world/bs-md-travel-ban-reaction-20180627-story.html) Most news stories are written by contract reporters who utilize credible sources such as the [Baltimore Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/baltimore-sun/), interviews, and large blocks of quotes.
A review of
[editorial columns](http://www.capitalgazette.com/opinion/columns/) reveals a left-leaning bias in favor of Democratic candidates and policies and negative toward Republicans [Analysis: The midterm stakes are clear — election deniers will be on many ballots](https://capitalgazette.search.yahoo.com/click/_ylt=AwrJ7J7IHYhi9QoAdRVXNyoA;_ylu=Y29sbwNiZjEEcG9zAzMEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Nj/RV=2/RE=1653116488/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.capitalgazette.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fct-aud-nw-nyt-midterms-election-deniers-20220519-pd4qjhfh2vf43kejjj7wgqegzm-story.html/RK=2/RS=r5PORZGZREzZTGN6dYt.DjGHdnQ-). In general, news reporting is factual and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
However, with a change in ownership with known ties to conservative causes, it is not yet clear what impact it will have on the
[editorial direction](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/economy/baltimore-sun-david-smith-sinclair-owner-F77S3D47ORD7LNEPZ7PJCXSLWM/?fbclid=IwAR3_MuBhzSbK9xdMBm7z20U9YgS6yx5S3Ay5KEf4KYLD3J3GVIw1DIlrieE) of the Capital Gazette. For example, [Tax records show](https://wtop.com/baltimore/2024/01/the-baltimore-sun-is-returning-to-local-ownership-with-a-buyer-who-has-made-his-politics-clear/) Smith’s foundation has donated to the conservative group [Project Veritas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-veritas/), which is best known for making hidden camera stings on media and liberal figures.
MBFC will update the bias rating as we monitor the direction of the paper.
