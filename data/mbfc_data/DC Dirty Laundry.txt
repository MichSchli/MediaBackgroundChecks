Analysis / Bias
In review, DC Dirty Laundry is an extreme right conspiracy and propaganda website. The stories published on this site make it difficult to believe this is not a satire site; however, there isn’t a disclaimer, so we assume they are serious. For example, they promote the following conspiracies on the home page today:
[“I Know Where All The Bodies Are Buried”: Clinton Foundation CFO Spills the Beans to FBI, IRS](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/i-know-where-all-the-bodies-are-buried-clinton-foundation-cfo-spills-the-beans-to-fbi-irs/) [Immigrant children being organ harvested in massive global organ trade racket that’s beginning to be exposed](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/immigrant-children-being-organ-harvested-in-massive-global-organ-trade-racket-thats-beginning-to-be-exposed/) [BOMBSHELL: Evidence that Explosives took down WTC Buildings on 9/11 to go before Special Grand Jury](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/bombshell-evidence-that-explosives-took-down-wtc-buildings-on-9-11-to-go-before-special-grand-jury/) [Leader of Clinton-Linked NXIVM Sex Cult “Had Sex With 15-Year-Old Slave,” Locked Woman In Room For 2 Years & Approved Of Incest](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/leader-of-clinton-linked-nxivm-sex-cult-had-sex-with-15-year-old-slave-locked-woman-in-room-for-2-years-approved-of-incest/)
Outside of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, they also publish
[anti-vaccine pseudoscience propaganda](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/cover-up-media-says-girl-died-from-virus-in-truth-vaccines-killed-her/) from the discredited [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). Further, they also promote the conspiracy that the USA is funding [Biolabs](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/bioweapons-expert-warns-us-is-conducting-illicit-research-at-ukrainian-biolabs/) in Ukraine. [The US is not](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/russian-war-report-russian-duma-members-falsely-claim-ukraine-is-creating-ethnicity-targeting-bioweapons/). Generally, the stories’ sources come from other conspiracy websites such as [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) and the [Free Thought Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/free-thought-project/).
