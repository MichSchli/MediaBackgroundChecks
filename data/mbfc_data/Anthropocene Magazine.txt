History
Anthropocene (Formerly Conservation Magazine) is a digital, print, and live magazine that explores how we can create a sustainable human age we want to live in. Anthropocene works with a network of over 4,000 journalists in developing countries through a partnership with Earth Journalism Network. According to their
[about page](http://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/about-us/), they state “Our mission is to curate a global conversation about data, technology, and innovation that lead to solutions to the persistent environmental challenges of our time. Much like [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), [MIT Technology Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mit-technology-review/), and [Harvard Business Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/harvard-business-review/) have done for their respective fields, we aim to build a thought-leader publication for the sustainability and development world.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Anthropocene is a non-profit initiative of
[Future Earth](http://www.futureearth.org/), a global science consortium. According to their [about page](http://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/about-us/), “We accept gifts, grants, and sponsorships from individuals and organizations for the general support of our activities, but our news judgments are made independently and not on the basis of donor support.” They further state that they disclose all donations over $5,000; however, we cannot find them, indicating they either have not received any or lack transparency.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Anthropocene publishes news and information primarily geared toward sustainability, the environment, and technology. While this source could be placed in our
[pro-science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pro-science/) category, they also present information with a left-leaning bias. For example, when reporting on former President Trump, they report negatively such as this: [Why citizen science may shine, even in Trump’s world](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/01/why-citizen-science-may-shine-even-in-trumps-world/). Like most stories on this website, it is well-sourced. Editorially, they take positions that align more with the Democratic Party, such as with [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), where they have a pro-science, concerned perspective: [Climate change cooks up a toxic ocean stew](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2018/09/climate-change-will-worsen-orcas-exposure-to-pollution/). In general, Anthropocene is a pro-science source that presents information with a left-leaning political bias.
