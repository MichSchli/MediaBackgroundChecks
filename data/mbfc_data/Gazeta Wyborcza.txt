Analysis / Bias
According to Voxeurop.Eu Gazeta Wyborcza
[provides](https://voxeurop.eu/en/source/gazeta-wyborcza-2/) “informative and secular-minded news in a society where the Catholic church is excessively influential.”
Currently, the President of Poland is
[Andrzej Duda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poland-media-profile/) (backed by the right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party – PiS). The Law and Justice (PiS) party exerts its political influence over state institutions like the Public Service Media and public media such as Gazeta Wyborcza, which is subject to [government pressure](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poland-media-profile/), including cutting off advertising from state-controlled businesses.
In review, Gazeta Wyborcza publishes articles with a pro-European tone, such as “
[Conflict with Brussels only weakens Warsaw.”](https://wyborcza.pl/magazyn/7,124059,28793282,zwolennicy-pis-powinni-zrozumiec-ze-to-kaczynski-najskuteczniej.html) In the body of the article, the author urges PiS supporters to look at the conduct of Jarosław Kaczyński (co-founder and leader of the Law and Justice party) and Poland’s foreign policy under his party. The article states, “the effectiveness of current government in defending Polish interest is dramatically low. That is why it is covered with increasingly harsher anti-German and anti-EU rhetoric.” Another article critical of the nationalistic PiS government utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as [“The deputy commander of the city police in Krakow lost his job because he refused to take megaphones from the protesters in front of the PiS headquarters.”](https://krakow.wyborcza.pl/krakow/7,44425,28945699,zastepca-komendanta-miejskiego-policji-w-krakowie-stracil-posade.html?&_ga=2.231335519.1301284995.1664019111-1712495591.1664019111#S.editors_pick_hp-K.P-B.1-L.2.zw)
On issues such as the environment, they are pro-science, supporting the consensus of science on climate change, and they publish supplements such as the
[“Ecological Newsletter.”](https://wyborcza.pl/0,166389,25001082.html?utm_source=zajawka&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ekologiczny&utm_content=long#S.embed_link-K.C-B.1-L.1.zw) Although factual in reporting, they rely on quotes rather than hyperlinked sourcing. In general, Gazeta Wyborcza holds a left-leaning bias.
