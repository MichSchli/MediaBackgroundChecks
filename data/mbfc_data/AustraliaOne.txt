History
[The Australia One Party](https://australiaoneparty.com/who-is-australiaone/) is a political entity led by Riccardo Bosi, a former Australian Army Special Forces lieutenant colonel who has transitioned into a far right-wing extremist activist. Bosi, alongside Dave “Guru” Graham, a known conspiracy theorist and self-described “free thinker,” has expressed intentions to contest the NSW (state election to dismantle the current political system from within.) This ambition is articulated through their goal to [“tear the place down”](https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/tear-the-place-down-inside-cookers-bizarre-plan-to-run-for-nsw-parliament/news-story/25c6273feb2ff97cd02c9f04ce0c250a) and “collapse the entire system,” including the government, judiciary, and law enforcement, to expose and rectify alleged longstanding governmental malfeasance.

The leadership of the party, prominently featuring [Conspiracy Theorist ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/australian-woman-reveals-heartbreak-as-loving-husband-sucked-into-conspiracies/2S24PVRGJVDMDKEXKEJ4DKSMCY/)Riccardo Bosi, suggests a centralization of control and ideology, with the party’s direction closely tied to Bosi’s personal political and ideological stance.
Analysis / Bias
The political stance of the Australia One Party, as articulated by Bosi and his associates, aligns with far-right extremist ideologies characterized by radical opposition to the current political system, promotion of conspiracy theories such as
[anti-vaccine](https://australiaoneparty.com/political-landscape-the-covid-vaccine-and-the-secret-pfizer-report/) narratives, and advocacy for drastic measures against perceived enemies of the state such as suggesting severe punishments for their roles in [pandemic management.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-04/anti-vax-group-my-place-plan-to-influence-your-local-council/102166182) The use of inflammatory rhetoric, such as the call to [“collapse the government”](https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/politics/tear-the-place-down-inside-cookers-bizarre-plan-to-run-for-nsw-parliament/news-story/25c6273feb2ff97cd02c9f04ce0c250a) and the endorsement of severe penalties for those accused of treason or sedition, underscores a commitment to authoritarian and punitive governance principles. This approach diverges significantly from mainstream political discourse, advocating for a radical overhaul of societal structures rather than engagement with existing democratic processes.
The Australia One Party’s discourse, particularly in sections such as the
[“Law of War”](https://australiaoneparty.com/law-of-war/) on their website, employs historical and philosophical references to critique what they perceive as a moral decline in contemporary society. This narrative does not directly accuse specific entities or individuals of corruption in the conventional sense of financial or political misconduct. Instead, it suggests a broader moral and ethical corruption, portraying modern Australia as a society that has lost its moral compass, drawing parallels with ancient civilizations characterized by morally reprehensible practices. This portrayal is part of a broader strategy that aligns with far-right ideologies, which often use the theme of a return to moral or traditional values as a rallying cry. The party’s use of such narratives can contribute to a divisive and confrontational political stance, seeking to undermine trust in current societal norms and institutions by presenting them as fundamentally flawed or corrupt in a moral or ethical sense.
By framing contemporary societal issues within the context of a profound moral crisis, the Australia One Party’s rhetoric diverges from mainstream political discourse, which typically focuses on policy and governance issues. This approach can resonate with individuals who feel alienated by the current political and social climate, potentially escalating political tensions and contributing to societal polarization.
The Australia One Party, led by Riccardo Bosi, represents a move towards extreme political expression, challenging democratic norms. While diverse political views are important, this party’s approach raises questions about its impact on democratic institutions and societal harmony. In general, they promote far-right conspiracies and pseudoscience.
