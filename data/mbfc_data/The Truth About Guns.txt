Analysis / Bias
The Truth About Guns reports on gun reviews, gear reviews, guns for beginners, and facts about guns. They also report news from a pro-gun, 2nd amendment perspective such as this
[Bloomberg: NRA Is Trying to Save Their Organization By Pushing Constitutional Carry… or Something](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/bloomberg-nra-is-trying-to-save-their-organization-by-pushing-constitutional-carry-or-something/). This story is properly sourced to [Time](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/) and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/).
Editorially, they hold a conservative right perspective and frequently report negatively on the Biden Administrations’ policies, such as this
[Biden to use GAO-Estimated ‘Gun Violence’ Healthcare Data to Push Gun Control Agenda](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/biden-to-use-gao-estimated-gun-violence-healthcare-data-to-push-gun-control-agenda/). They also favored the former Trump Administration with articles such as this [Trump Executive Order Expands Access to Concealed Carry Permits for Federal Prosecutors, Judges](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/trump-executive-order-expands-access-to-concealed-carry-permits-for-prosecutors-judges/), and support for the [NRA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-rifle-association-nra/) [Wayne LaPierre to NRA Membership: ALL IS WELL!](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/wayne-lapierre-to-nra-membership-all-is-well/)
While we found them well-sourced to mostly credible information and institutions, it is very apparent that the aim is to only present info that favors guns and rejects gun control. Although the information is evidence-based, it is misleading because they only choose to present one side of this story.
