Analysis / Bias
The Daily Wire presents news with a hyper-partisan conservative bias in reporting and wording. For example, headlines are usually sensational and utilize strong emotional language such as this:
[Democrats Boo God. Then They Quote The Bible To Attack Trump](https://www.dailywire.com/news/31913/democrats-boo-god-then-they-quote-bible-attack-michael-j-knowles). Virtually every story favors the right and denigrates the left. However, the Daily Wire does not always report favorably on former President Trump and his policies.
When it comes to science they often do not align with climate scientists’ consensus that humans are a significant factor in
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). See the fact checks below.
Editorially, in 2022, The Daily Wire frequently reports negatively on Democrats using emotional language such as this
[Joe Biden Recalls The Old Days Of Having Lunch With ‘Real Segregationists’ – Again](https://www.dailywire.com/news/joe-biden-recalls-the-old-days-of-having-lunch-with-real-segregationists-again). Reporting on Republicans tends to be positive such as this [Mike Pence Credits Trump Supreme Court Appointments, American People With Probable Overturn Of Roe v. Wade](https://www.dailywire.com/news/mike-pence-credits-trump-supreme-court-appointments-american-people-with-probable-overturn-of-roe-v-wade). In general, almost all stories favor the right.
Update: We reviewed their past failed fact checks with this update and found that most were corrected or edited for accuracy. Therefore, we removed fixed failed fact checks, which moved the Daily Wire from the Questionable list. We still rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to a few uncorrected fact checks and the fact that they frequently publish stories that require corrections.
