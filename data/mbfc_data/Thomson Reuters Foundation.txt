Analysis / Bias
In review, the Foundation’s primary purpose is to provide skills-based training programs to reporters worldwide in seven languages and across 170 countries. As of 2015, over 15,000 journalists have been trained internationally on 27 specialized training topics. The website also provides news that focuses on left-leaning issues such as Coronavirus, Women, LGBT, Climate, Economies, Technologies, Slavery, Cities, and Land. Some stories utilize loaded emotional language such as this
[Climate change poses growing threats to vulnerable Africa, UN says](https://news.trust.org/item/20201026120616-yxisk/). Other stories on the website come directly from Reuters.
In general, story selection and editorial positions moderately favor the left but are based on fact.
