Analysis / Bias
In review, the (New York) Observer’s articles cover both sides when reporting news and typically use a neutral tone:
[“Trump Revises Travel Ban, Adds Non-Muslim North Korea and Venezuela.](http://observer.com/2017/09/trump-revises-travel-ban-adds-non-muslim-north-korea-and-venezuela/)” News articles are also properly sourced to other credible media outlets. However Op-Ed’s tend to favor the right wing with loaded wording, which is in both headlines and articles such as: “ [Liberals Hated FBI Director James Comey (Until Trump Fired Him)](http://observer.com/2017/05/liberals-hated-fbi-director-james-comey-until-trump-fired-him/),” [“What Happened: The Strange Convergence of Hillary Clinton and Vietnam”](http://observer.com/2017/09/what-happened-strange-convergence-hillary-clinton-vietnam/) and [“Hillary Clinton Is What Happened: New Book Will Offer More Excuses.”](http://observer.com/2017/07/hillary-clinton-book-what-happened/)
Regarding New York Observer’s editorial voice, in 2014, the
[NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) interviewed Jared Kushner, who stated, [“We stand for common sense, what’s great for New York. We’re pro-business and anti-entitlements.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/business/media/new-york-observer-to-unveil-new-design-and-its-not-pink.html) Further, during the 2016 Presidential election, the Observer [endorsed Donald Trump](http://observer.com/2016/04/in-the-republican-primary-donald-trump-for-president/).
