History
When I set out to review this website, my first thought was this must be another WW3 conspiracy website. I was pleasantly surprised to find it a very credible source. The Defcon Warning System was founded in 1984 and, over the years, transitioned to the web. Defcon is not affiliated with the Government, as explained on their
[about page](https://defconwarningsystem.com/about/). Their mission is to report news about the threat of nuclear war and prepare for the event. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Defcon Warning System lacks transparency as they do not clearly indicate ownership. Advertising and donations generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Defcon mostly republishes news articles related to nuclear issues from credible sources that range from
[Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and the right-leaning [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/). There is minimal use of loaded words, and any loaded language is dependent on the source they are republishing. We could not find any instances of failed fact-checks from this source. Defcon also has a community forum that discusses related topics (you might find misinformation in these forums).
