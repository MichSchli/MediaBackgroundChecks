Analysis / Bias
Awake Canada presents news and opinions on Covid-19 and Vaccines from a conspiratorial perspective, as evidenced by its coverage of Covid 19. For example, this video featuring anti-vaccination doctors,
[“Doctors All Over The World URGENT Warnings Of Taking The Covid 19 Vaccine. Watch This Video!”](https://awakecanada.org/homepage/) and [“What ‘Covid-19’ Really Is” Dr ‘Judy Mikovits’ PhD. Explains What ‘Sars Cov2’ ‘MRNA’ Vaccines Are.”](https://awakecanada.org/what-covid-19-really-is/) Judy Mikovits has been known to make claims that have been proven to be false such as this [“Fact check: Unfounded claim that 50 million Americans would die from COVID-19 vaccine.”](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-mikovits-vaccine-50/fact-check-unfounded-claim-that-50-million-americans-would-die-from-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN23U2FL)
The website exhibits a consistent conservative bias that contains factually incorrect information or misleading claims, such as
[“Overview of Massive Voter Fraud to Steal the Election,”](https://awakecanada.org/overview-of-massive-voter-fraud-to-steal-the-election/) which suggests that the 2020 US Presidential Election was stolen through voter fraud. There has been [no evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) of large-scale systemic election fraud that would change the election results. Additionally, the website does not always provide clear attribution for its sources or relies on [Questionable sources](https://awakecanada.org/homeopathic-remedies-in-covid-19-prognostic-factor-research/) like [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), which has failed numerous fact-checks related to vaccines and health.
Finally, the website promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience, such as
[weather modification](https://awakecanada.org/weather-modification-is-real/), [homeopathic remedies for Covid-19](https://awakecanada.org/homeopathic-remedies-in-covid-19-prognostic-factor-research/), and [alternative theories](https://awakecanada.org/category/climate-change/) on the cause of climate change that are opposed to climate scientists’ consensus. In general, Awake Canada is a right-wing conspiracy and pseudoscience website that promotes conservative propaganda.
Failed Fact Checks
[No, ‘top doctor’ wrong – US reporting system Vaers doesn’t say thousands of deaths ‘directly due to’ Covid vaccines.](https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/no-top-doctor-wrong-us-reporting-system-vaers-doesnt-say)– False [“Canadian Court Ends Covid Emergency | Mask Mandates, Lockdowns, & Emergency Use Jab are now Unlawful.](https://factcheck.afp.com/http%253A%252F%252Fdoc.afp.com%252F9F46TM-1)– Misleading
Based on our analysis, Awake Canada is far right-biased and a Tin-Foil Hat Conspiracy and Quackery level Pseudoscience website based on promoting false and misleading information regarding Covid-19, the 2020 US Presidential Election, vaccines, and science. (M Huitsing 03/28/2023)
