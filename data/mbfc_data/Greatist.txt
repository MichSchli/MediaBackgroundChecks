Analysis / Bias
Greatist focuses on health, nutrition, and physical fitness. For example, the article
[“The Ultimate Guide to Vitamins and Minerals” ](https://greatist.com/health/ultimate-guide-vitamins-and-minerals)provides information about vitamins and minerals. It employs a generally neutral tone but includes some informal language for engagement (“yeeeeeeeeeeah boiiiiiiiii”). It cites sources that vary in reliability, including credible ones like the [National Institutes of Health (NIH](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-institutes-of-health-nih/)) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), [Healthline,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/healthline/#google_vignette) and [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), which has mixed credibility.
The article
[“Don’t #DiagnoseTrump. It Only Hurts People Living With Mental Illness”](https://greatist.com/live/diagnosis-trump-hurts-people-living-with-mental-illness#2) discusses the trend of #DiagnoseTrump on Twitter and the potential negative consequences of attempting to diagnose public figures, particularly politicians, with mental illnesses from a distance.
Generally, the article is neutral and informative, focusing on the implications of diagnosing public figures like
[Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). However, The phrase, “The hate he spews shows he’s racist, sexist, Islamaphobic, and anti-Semitic—not mentally ill,” employs emotionally loaded language to characterize Donald Trump’s behavior in a highly negative light. It uses terms like “hate,” “racist,” “sexist,” “Islamaphobic,” and “anti-Semitic” to describe his actions, which is a strongly negative tone towards him. Additionally, the phrase implies that Trump’s actions are primarily motivated by these negative traits rather than being attributed to mental illness, which reinforces the negative characterization.
The article
[“Calling All the Grown and Sexy: The 11 Best Yoga Poses for Sex”](https://greatist.com/health/yoga-sex-positions#puppy-pose) on Greatist is informative and focuses on how particular yoga poses can enhance sexual experiences; the content is based more on the input of the featured experts, Eric M. Garrison and Martha Langer, and also cites The National Center for Biotechnology.
While most content on Greatist is reasonably sourced and fact-based, some content promotes pseudoscience, such as this:
[The 11 best crystals for weight loss](https://greatist.com/health/crystals-for-weight-loss#gemstones-for-weight-loss). They are careful to disclaim there is no scientific evidence to support this claim “TBH, there’s basically no science to prove crystals can help weight loss. And what info we do have is uber-anecdotal.” Despite that, they still list 11 crystals that [won’t work](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-crystal-healing/), which comes off as an endorsement of the debunked pseudoscience of crystal healing.
In general, Greatist is a pro-science health and wellness website that predominantly relies on scientific sources for its information. While it maintains a commitment to scientific rigor, it occasionally features articles that explore alternative health practices. It’s worth noting that the website typically does not publish political articles unless they directly pertain to health topics. However, political articles often hold a left-leaning bias.
