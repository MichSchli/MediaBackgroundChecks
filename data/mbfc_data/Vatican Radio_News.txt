Analysis / Bias
Vatican Radio (VR) is, as stated on the
[website](http://www.archivioradiovaticana.va/): “The voice of the Pope and the Church in dialogue with the World.”
In review, Vatican Radio exists to promote the Catholic faith to the world, and most of the stories on the site have a decidedly religious slant. That said, VR is not overly evangelical in its reporting. While the majority of the articles on VR focus on the day-to-day matters concerning the Vatican, and the Pope, they do carry some non-religion world news as well. These non-religious articles are factual and presented with a minimum of religious bias. Compared to other religion-based news sources, VR is, on the whole, well-written, informative, and well-presented.
The Vatican News website relies on credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), News agencies like ANSA, and the [World Health Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/). While some stories are presented from a religious perspective, most are solid fact-based news stories that support the consensus of science, such as this [Holy See reiterates call for universal access to Covid-19 vaccines](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2022-03/holy-see-calls-for-universal-access-to-covid-19-vaccines.html) and [Holy See: Joint efforts needed to face environmental, social crisis](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2022-10/holy-see-common-efforts-environmental-social-crises-osce.html). Generally, the news is reported factually and has a slightly right-leaning bias regarding abortion and contraceptives.
