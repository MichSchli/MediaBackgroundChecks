Analysis / Bias
In review, Ecowatch’s primary focus is on climate change, and they support the consensus of science regarding this issue. Stories often come from other sources such as the left-leaning
[Common Dreams](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/common-dreams/) such as this: [Harris and AOC Introduce Climate Equity Act to Protect Frontline Communities.](https://www.ecowatch.com/harris-aoc-climate-legislation-2639501313.html) This story is properly sourced. For the most part, Ecowatch reports with a left-leaning pro-environmental bias. In the past, Ecowatch published stories that did not align with the consensus of science regarding [GMO safety](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and [vaccinations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). In 2018, leadership was changed, and Ecowatch moved to a more pro-science approach. Several articles were removed, and since 2018 we cannot find evidence of them advancing pseudoscience.
Editorially, Ecowatch promotes a liberal perspective such as this
[Climate Skepticism Linked to Conservative Politics Predominantly in U.S.](https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-denial-conservatism-2567319606.html) This story is properly sourced to [Nature](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nature/) and [Ars Technica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ars-technica/). When reporting on the former trump Administration, the topic is always related to the environment and is typically negative such as this [Trump Campaign Is Selling Plastic Straws to ‘Make Straws Great Again](https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-campaign-plastic-straws-2639302658.html).’ This story is also properly sourced from [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/) and [NPR](https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-campaign-plastic-straws-2639302658.html).
However, we have found that pseudoscientific articles still remain on the website such as this that references the discredited Natural News:
[Taiwan Bans GMOs in Schools, Mandates Strict Label Laws](https://www.ecowatch.com/taiwan-bans-gmos-in-schools-mandates-strict-label-laws-1882148697.html). In general, Ecowatch reports environmental news from a strong liberal perspective and, in recent years, has made an effort to promote [evidence-based science,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but some pseudoscience promotion remains.
