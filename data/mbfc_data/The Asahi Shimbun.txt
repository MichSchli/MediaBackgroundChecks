Analysis / Bias
The Asahi is known for its liberal/progressive views and often has been criticized by right-leaning media in Japan. According to
[Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), In 2014, [Asahi ran an article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/27/the-silencing-of-japans-free-press-shinzo-abe-media/) about Comfort Women, a euphemism for sex slaves commonly used in Imperial Japan during WW2 as well as investigations into Fukushima, which later The Asahi pulled back from following right-wing criticism led by Prime Minister Abe himself, where he accused Asahi of damaging Japan’s reputation.
In 2017, according to Japanese Daily
[Mainichi Shimbun](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20171130/p2a/00m/0na/020000c), the Japanese right-wing nationalist political party ( [Nippon Ishin- Japan Innovation Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Ishin_no_Kai)) lawmaker Yasushi Adachi attacked The Asahi Shimbun, for being biased over an editorial. Also, in 2017, The Asahi Shimbun published an [investigative report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-12/the-school-scandal-haunting-japan-prime-minister-abe-quicktake) involving the current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s wife Akie, over a Conservative Government land deal, and tampering with official records. Due to its [coverage of the scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/japan-charges-dropped-cronyism-scandal-threateningshinzo-abe), The Asahi Shimbun became the target of [criticism](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201802140031.html) by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
When covering national news, The Asahi Shimbun utilizes moderately loaded emotional language such as this:
[“Medical school rigged exam scores to keep female ratio low.”](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201808020051.html) and [“EDITORIAL: METI’s clerical error excuse does nothing to explain JIC mess.”](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201812120023.html) All stories are sourced to credible media outlets.
When covering world news, such as the USA, they use minimally loaded language such as “
[Japan denies Trump made Pearl Harbor remark to Abe](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201808300018.html)” and they tend to source to credible sources such as the [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) The Asahi Shimbun also publishes [articles](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201812030017.html) from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
