Analysis / Bias
In review, Marginal Revolution is a Libertarian-leaning economic blog by Cowan and Tabarrok. The blog’s name is based on
[Marginal Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility), which explains “choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.”
The blog features original writing from Cowan and Tabarrok and a daily list of links to general interest news stories and facts curated by Tyler Cowan. Some of the sources they link to include
[PNAS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-of-the-united-states-of-america-pnas/), [Economist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economist/), [Buzzfeed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/buzzfeed/), and the [Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/).
Original content generally consists of stories and information about economics. The authors also frequently write about Libertarianism such as this:
[What libertarianism has become and will become — State Capacity Libertarianism](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/01/what-libertarianism-has-become-and-will-become-state-capacity-libertarianism.html). This article is properly sourced. Other articles are snippets and summaries from outside sources, such as this from [Courthouse News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/courthouse-news-service/): [Taliban markets in everything](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/taliban-markets-in-everything.html).
Editorially, Marginal Revolution favors free-market economics; however, they depart from strongly right-leaning Libertarians who recognize the state must play a role in some regulation. Further, unlike many free-market Libertarians, they support the
[scientific consensus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on human-influenced [climate change](https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=climate+change).
