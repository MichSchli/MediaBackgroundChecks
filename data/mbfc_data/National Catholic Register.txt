Analysis / Bias
The National Catholic register publishes news about Catholocism and the Vatican. They also cover national and international news focusing on conservative issues such as abortion and politics. Articles and headlines use moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Hindu Nationalist Party Bids to Woo Christians in State Elections in India](https://www.ncregister.com/news/hindu-nationalist-party-bids-to-woo-christians-in-state-elections-in-india). This story properly uses hyperlinked souring to the [Times of India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-india/); however, they also link to the Questionable [NDTV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ndtv/). In another story, [NIH Reverses Restrictions on Fetal Tissue Research](https://www.ncregister.com/news/nih-reverses-restrictions-on-fetal-tissue-research), there isn’t any sourcing at all.
The National Catholic Register holds a right-leaning conservative bias as they frequently favor anti-abortion and anti-fetal tissue measures. They have mixed feelings about President Joe Biden when reporting on US politics. On the one hand, they recognize he is Catholic. Still, on the other hand, they report negatively on his abortion positions

When reporting on science, they often go against the consensus on topics such as evolution
[Divine Mercy Miracle Caught On Video, A Christian Rebuttal To Darwinian Evolution, And More Links!](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/divine-mercy-miracle-caught-on-video-a-christian-rebuttal-to-darwinian-evolution-and-more-links) Further, they have reported on debunked pseudoscience such as the [abortion-breast cancer link](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/abortion-is-the-primary-preventable-risk-factor-for-breast-cancer). According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), “After adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors, the researchers found that induced abortion(s) had no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer. The size of this study and the manner in which it was done provide good evidence that induced abortion does not affect a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer.” The National Catholic Registers generally hold a right-leaning conservative bias and do not always report the news factually.
