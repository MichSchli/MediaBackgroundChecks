Analysis / Bias
In review, Castanet reports news concerning British Columbia through a combination of staff reporting and republishing from third-party sources such as
[The Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) and Tri-City News. Headlines are often low biased such as this: [2 men charged for murder](https://www.castanet.net/news/BC/276589/Charges-approved-in-2019-Vancouver-homicide). World News is exclusively republished from the Canadian Press.
Political news reporting also relies on the least biased Canadian Press. In general, Castanet reports news with minimal bias and often utilizes external least biased sources for news outside of British Columbia.
