Analysis / Bias
In review, Summit News publishes extreme right biased content that consistently uses loaded language such as
[Public Banned From Seeing School Shooting Case Involving Transgender Anti-Trump Culprit](https://summit.news/2019/05/16/public-banned-from-seeing-school-shooting-case-involving-transgender-anti-trump-culprit/) and [Feminist Says Family Must Be “Abolished” to ‘Dismantle Capitalism’.](https://summit.news/2019/05/17/feminist-says-family-must-be-abolished-to-dismantle-capitalism/) Although Summit News occasionally sources to credible outlets they often link to Youtube videos and social media posts and then react with shock and outrage against the left, Muslims, and Feminists. They frequently promote conspiracy theories such as the Notre Dame Cathedral fire being set by [arsonists](https://summit.news/2019/04/15/notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris-on-fire-worker-claims-it-was-deliberately-started/). The source of this came from a Time journalist tweet, who then deleted the tweet within minutes, however, Summit News did not change their story. In other stories, they promote white nationalism through their fear that [Whites are being replaced](https://summit.news/2019/03/25/disturbing-canadian-man-compared-to-mosque-shooter-for-talking-about-great-replacement/) in countries like Canada.
