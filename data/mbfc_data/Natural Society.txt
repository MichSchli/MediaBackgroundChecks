History
According to Natural Society’s previous about page, they are “a source for useful organic living tips, news, and life hacks that can take your health to the next level.” We can no longer find an about page with this new review, thereby lacking transparency. The domain is

Funded by / Ownership
The website lacks transparency as they do not adequately disclose ownership. An online shop that sells merchandise generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Natural Society covers a wide range of topics such from the conspiracy theories of
[Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) and [Geoengineering](http://naturalsociety.com/geo-engineering-scientist-terrified-projects-helped-create/) to pseudosciences such as [Vaccine Dangers](http://naturalsociety.com/suppressed-study-shows-vaccine-dangers-autoimmune-diseases/) and [GMO hysteria](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). Many articles focus on GMOs, such as this [The Next Monsanto Glyphosate Cancer Trial is Set to Begin in March](https://naturalsociety.com/next-monsanto-glyphosate-cancer-trial-set-begin-march-7000/). While their information is still online, they have not published new material since 2020. Natural Society will be retired upon the next review if they do not post again.
