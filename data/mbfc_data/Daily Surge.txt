Analysis / Bias
The Daily Surge mostly produces opinion pieces written by Steve Pauwels. The author takes an existing news story from another source and creates an op-ed piece around the story. The Daily Surge frequently uses loaded emotional language that favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this
[Wake Up, America: ‘Moderate’ Joe Biden Is No More, Radical Joe Is at Work](https://dailysurge.com/2021/05/wake-up-america-moderate-joe-biden-is-no-more-radical-joe-is-at-work/). This story is completely unsourced. Each article begins with a summary that tells about the piece and also reveals significant bias such as this “The damage being inflicted upon America by the Biden Administration is nothing new – Socialist/Communist regimes have been working it for a long time. The “moderate” Biden of years gone by is no more. Radical Leftists are now using him to transform our nation; to the detriment of America.”
Editorially, all stories favor the right. For example, the website has a tagline that reads “We Don’t Take a Knee,” presumably a reaction to police brutality protests. They also offer Pro-Life perspectives such as this
[It’s Past Time to Humanize, Publicize the Victims of Abortion](https://dailysurge.com/2021/05/its-past-time-to-humanize-publicize-the-victims-of-abortion/). Finally, they admire former [President Trump](https://dailysurge.com/2021/01/power-of-faith-in-the-face-of-a-donald-trump-election-loss/) and often published [election fraud misinformation](https://dailysurge.com/2021/01/time-has-come-fight-election-fraud-now-or-maybe-never/). Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they frequently promoted [misinformation regarding masks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) such as this [The Evidence Continues to Speak: It Is Scientifically Impossible for Masks to Work](https://dailysurge.com/2020/09/the-evidence-continues-to-speak-it-is-scientifically-impossible-for-masks-to-work/). Masks are an effective means of slowing the spread of Covid-19 and other diseases.
