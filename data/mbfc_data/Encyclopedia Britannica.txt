Analysis / Bias
In review, Encyclopedia Britannica provides an enormous amount of information covering history, science, technology, and more. The website is set up with a search bar at the top of the screen to search for the topic you are interested in. The homepage also features articles with minimal bias, such as this:
[Do Plants Feel Pain](https://www.britannica.com/story/do-plants-feel-pain)? This article is properly sourced, and in case you are interested, plants do not feel pain because they do not have pain receptors. Thanks, Britannica!
