Analysis / Bias
In review, at the top of the website Flake News clearly disclaims they are a satire website with this tagline “UNBIASED POLITICAL SATIRE & HUMOR FOR SNOWFLAKES LIKE YOU. We Only Report What We Want to Hear. You Decide.” Most stories revolve around political issues such as this:
[White House Sends Hodor To US-Mexico Border To Keep Door Closed](https://www.flake.news/now/2019/05/09/white-house-sends-hodor), and this [Republican Comedy Festival Canceled Due to Lack of Talent](https://www.flake.news/now/2019/04/12/republican-comedy-festival). Although Flake News takes swipes at both sides, they seem to prefer satire that portrays the right negatively, though humorously.
