Analysis / Bias
In review, DJHJ Media publishes summarized news stories with the addition of conservative commentary and straight opinion pieces. News stories utilize highly emotional wording that favors the right such as this:
[‘Defund the Police’ Movement Gets Smacked With Reality After Significant Spikes in Violent Crime](https://djhjmedia.com/rich/defund-the-police-movement-gets-smacked-with-reality-after-significant-spikes-in-violent-crime/). This story is sourced from the factually mixed [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). Another story reads [Trump Administration Warns Anti-White Discrimination May Cost Corporations Their Federal Contracts,](https://djhjmedia.com/eric/trump-administration-warns-anti-white-discrimination-may-cost-corporations-their-federal-contracts/) sourced from the Questionable [Big League Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-league-politics/).
Further, DJHJ media frequently promotes right-wing conspiracy theories such as Kamala Harris not being eligible to be Vice President
[Kamala Harris Fights Back Against Questions of Her Eligibility to Be Vice President](https://djhjmedia.com/rich/kamala-harris-fights-back-against-questions-of-her-eligibility-to-be-vice-president/). Kamala Harris is obviously qualified to be Vice President as she is an American [Citizen](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/kamala-harris-is-eligible-to-serve-as-president/). Further, they have promoted misinformation regarding Coronavirus as well as furthering conspiracies regarding [mail-in ballots](https://djhjmedia.com/rich/for-democrats-the-writing-is-on-the-wall-too-bad-they-cant-read/), in which they claim without evidence that “It has been their plan for some time because mail-in voting is how the Democrats expect to cheat enough to beat Donald Trump in November.” In general, story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left. DJHJ Media promotes far-right propaganda and conspiracy theories, as evidenced by the above claims.
