History
[Founded in 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change), The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based in Geneva, Switzerland, is a body of the United Nations providing scientific information relevant to understanding the risk of human-influenced climate change, its natural, political, and economic impacts, and possible response options. Korean economist [Hoesung Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoesung_Lee) has been the chair of the IPCC since 2015.
According to their
[about page](https://www.ipcc.ch/about/), “the objective of the IPCC is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information that they can use to develop climate policies.” [Read our profile on Switzerland’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/switzerland-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
[The IPCC receives funding](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/decision_p35_budget.pdf) through the IPCC Trust Fund, established in 1989 by the [United Nations Environment Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme) (UNEP) and the [World Meteorological Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization) (WMO). Annual cash contributions to the Trust Fund are made by the WMO, by UNEP, and by IPCC Members. Payments and their size are voluntary.
Analysis / Bias
The IPCC produces reports every 5-8 years on climate change.
[The reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/09/ipcc-principles.pdf) cover the “scientific, technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.” However, the IPCC does not engage in original research but rather assesses published literature, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources. Thousands of scientists and experts worldwide contribute by reading reports that up to 120 governments then review.
The latest report was published in 2014. Below are major conclusions from the 2014 report.
- “Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last
[800,000 years](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf).” [Human influence on the climate system is clear](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf). [Increasing magnitudes](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar5_wgII_spm_en.pdf)of global warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. [Without new policies](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf)to mitigate climate change, projections suggest increasing global mean temperature in 2100 of 3.7 to 4.8 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels.
To summarize, global warming/climate change is human-influenced and will have significant impacts economically, sociologically, and environmentally on a global scale. The next report is due in 2022. In general, The IPCC is a pro-science source.
