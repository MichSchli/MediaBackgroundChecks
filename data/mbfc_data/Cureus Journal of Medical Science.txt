Analysis / Bias
The Cureus Journal of Medical Science is an open-access online medical journal that allows researchers to
[publish studies faster](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/09/scicheck-clinical-trials-show-ivermectin-does-not-benefit-covid-19-patients-contrary-to-social-media-claims/) than traditional peer-reviewed journals. Its peer-review process involves asking experts to review a given article in a few days. [According](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/29/journal-issues-55-expressions-of-concern-at-once/#more-124797) to [Retraction Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/retraction-watch/), “The journal Cureus has issued expressions of concern for a whopping 55 papers whose authorship has come into question.” [They also point out](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/30/firing-publishing-ban-15-retractions-for-author-who-defrauded-co-authors-in-pay-to-publish-scheme/) that “Cureus has retracted 15 papers, including three on Covid-19, after concluding that the articles were produced in a scheme by a researcher in Pakistan who charged his co-authors to join the manuscripts, lied about the ethics approval for the studies and may have fabricated data.”
While many studies are credible, Cureus often relies on post-publication peer review. This leads to flawed studies being published, shared, and retracted later. Besides retractions, Cureus has failed fact checks related to Covid-19. See below.
