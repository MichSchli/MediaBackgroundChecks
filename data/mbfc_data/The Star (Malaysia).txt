Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/malaysia), Malaysia ranks 113/180 on the Press Freedom Index due to the media environment in Malaysia being threatened by increasing censorship.
In 2017, The Star published on its front page an
[article](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/05/28/home-ministry-to-summon-the-stars-editor-in-chief/) with the headline titled “Malaysian Terrorist Leader” right under a photograph showing Muslims praying. This caused an investigation and resulted in The Star editors getting [suspended.](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/05/30/two-top-editors-from-the-star-suspended/)
In review, The Star uses loaded language in their headlines and articles, such as
[“Dr. M and Muhyiddin seen chatting in Parliament on Monday (July 13),”](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/07/13/dr-m-and-muhyiddin-seen-chatting-in-parliament-on-monday-july-13) and tends to poorly source their articles. However, The Star reports international news through credible news agencies such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) with low bias and maintains factual reporting such as [“Trump takes swipes at Fauci, CDC as coronavirus cases rise.”](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2020/07/13/trump-takes-swipes-at-fauci-cdc-as-coronavirus-cases-rise)
Editorially, they favor the right and have a pro-Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) tone, such as this
[“MCA on ‘high ground’ amid national political chaos](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/focus/2020/03/08/mca-on-high-ground-amid-national-political-chaos).” Generally, international news is reported factually, while there is a right-leaning bias editorially.
