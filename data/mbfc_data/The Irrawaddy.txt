Analysis / Bias
In review, we openly admit that we do not have a strong understanding of the Myanmar/Burma political situation. We know that The Irrawaddy is opposed to the military control of the Burmese Government. At this time, they are heavily reporting on the Myanmar Coup in which the military overthrew the Democratically elected government.
Reporting is straightforward but emotional as they oppose the coup

When reporting on USA politics, they tend to favor Biden over Trump, such as this [The US Voted for Change; When Will Myanmar Truly Be Able to Do the Same?](https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/commentary/us-voted-change-will-myanmar-truly-able.html) Although we do not have a great understanding of Myanmar, we can confidently say that The Irrawady identifies more with the left and is proven to be factual.
