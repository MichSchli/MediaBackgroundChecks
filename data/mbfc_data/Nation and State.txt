History
[Founded in 2018](https://whois.domaintools.com/nationandstate.com), Nation and State is an anonymously published conservative news and opinion website. The website lacks transparency as it does not have an about page or disclose owners. The website offers a tagline, “Your Source for Patriot News and World Reports.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Nation and State do not appear to publish original content but rather serve as a curated news aggregation website. Typically, they publish a full article with a link to the source or a short snippet that links offsite to the source. Nation and State leave the original headlines, which often contain highly emotional wording that favors the right such as this

For news aggregation sites, we check the quality of the sources they utilize. In this case, Nation and State almost exclusively rely on far-right Questionable or Conspiracy websites such as
[American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/), [Diamond and Silk](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/diamondandsilkinc-com-bias/), [Truth in Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-in-media/), [DC Whispers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dc-whispers/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). Nation and State generally hold a far-right editorial bias through story selection and consistently rely on poor sources who routinely fail fact checks.
