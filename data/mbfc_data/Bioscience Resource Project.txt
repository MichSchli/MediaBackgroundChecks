Analysis / Bias
According to the
[Genetic Literacy Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/genetic-literacy-project/), Bioscienceresource.org [promotes its anti-GMO activities](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/bioscience-resource-project-anti-gmo-activist-group-promotes-conspiracy-theories-on-independent-science-news-website/#:~:text=The%20Bioscience%20Resource%20Project%20(BSR,News%20for%20Food%20and%20Agriculture.) primarily through its website, Independent Science News, and has ties to anti-biotechnology activist groups in the US, Canada, and Europe who support French geneticist Gilles-Éric Séralini’s research, which mainstream scientists have challenged.
During a
[year-long](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/05/09/year-long-investigation-refutes-myth-grassroots-anti-gmo-activism-14775) investigation, the [American Council on Science and Health (ACSH)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-council-on-science-and-health/) found that many anti-GMO organizations have received funding from organic food companies and wealthy donors, suggesting the movement is not entirely grassroots.
Although the primary focus is on Anti-GMO propaganda, they also promote unproven theories related to the origins of Covid-19, such as this:
[By Investigating Itself The US Can Answer Many Of The Key COVID19 Origin Questions](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/commentaries/by-investigating-itself-the-us-can-answer-many-of-the-key-covid19-origin-questions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=by-investigating-itself-the-us-can-answer-many-of-the-key-covid19-origin-questions). The article does provide some evidence to support its claims, such as citing published research papers and news articles. However, some of the claims made by the author are based on speculation and are not fully substantiated with concrete evidence. Some of the sources used for this article rely on poor sources like [Sky News Australia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news-australia/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/).
In general, the Bioscience Resource Project holds
[left-leaning views](https://bioscienceresource.org/why-sustainable-agriculture-should-support-a-green-new-deal/) and moderately promotes pseudoscience as it relates to GMOs.
