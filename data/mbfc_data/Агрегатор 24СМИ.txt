Analysis / Bias
Агрегатор 24СМИ or ex.24smi.info does not publish original content; instead, they link to news and information provided by other sources. The content on the website is highly sensational and often features scantily dressed women such as this
[Seductive beauties with tattoos](https://tinkoff-cabinet.net/foto/100-soblaznitelnye-krasotki-s-tatuirovkami.html). Other stories promote pseudoscience like this [The most fun men and women are born with this zodiac sign.](https://ex10.24smi.info/top/out/5834208/?psw=1920&psh=1080&pow=1920&poh=1040&pdpr=1&pdt=1707060476&ptz=-18000&pl=en-US&subid1=e&redirect_type=e&chash=353117f6-fc34-488e-974e-b4e0767d07e7&click_id=88338c60-5bcd-499e-886a-c025715baf44)
Editorially, the website links to stories that strongly favor the Russian government and in particular, President Putin, like this
[Putin’s decision will change the lives of migrants in Russia forever.](https://sib.fm/last/news/2024/01/30/reshenie-putina-izmenit-zhizn-migrantov-v-rossii-navsegda?utm_source=24smi&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=&utm_content=5899308&utm_campaign=44850&utm_referrer=24smi.info) Reporting on the West is often negative and follows the Russian Government’s narrative, such as this [Putin warned the entire West in one phrase](https://ex10.24smi.info/top/out/5867767/?psw=1920&psh=1080&pow=1920&poh=1040&pdpr=1&pdt=1707060970&ptz=-18000&pl=en-US&subid1=e&redirect_type=e&chash=353117f6-fc34-488e-974e-b4e0767d07e7&click_id=18958960-fd0f-4755-9f24-fa74f3555de0). Finally, when it comes to sourcing, they often link to unknown or other Russian sources that MBFC has deemed questionable, such as [Ria Novosti](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ria-novosti-bias/) and KP.ru.
In general, Агрегатор 24СМИ aligns with the right-leaning government and often publishes sensationalized content and routinely promotes pseudoscience.
