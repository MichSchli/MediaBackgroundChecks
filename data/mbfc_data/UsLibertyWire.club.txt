History
The UsLibertyWire.club domain was purchased in December of 2018. According to a
[domain search](http://whois.domaintools.com/uslibertywire.club) the registrant country is Pakistan. The website does have an [about page](https://www.uslibertywire.club/about-us/) that creates significant confusion. First, we have established a domain of UsLibertyWire.club. Second, the about page states “WE HERE AT CONSERVATIVE-DAILY HAVE TWO GOALS.” Its about page is [copied verbatim](https://conservative-daily.com/about-us/) from Conservative Daily. Third, the logo at the top of the website reads “Today Trump News.” If you are still reading this, the website has three names, but we are not done yet. When you click on their Privacy Policy it has a plagiarized copy of the now-defunct Trumpnewshouse.com’s privacy policy. In total 4 different names and all completely plagiarized.
Funded by / Ownership
The website lists
[MRC-Media Research Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-research-center-mrc/) as their owner, which simply is not true as UsLibertyWire.club is a fake news website based in Pakistan. It appears they are funded through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, UsLibertyWire.club is an extreme right fake news website with all articles written (plagiarized) by Anna Paul (probably not the real name). Headlines contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[US Lawmakers Introduce a Bill to Ban Sharia laws – Muslims are outraged](https://www.uslibertywire.club/us-lawmakers-introduce-a-bill-to-ban-sharia-laws-muslims-are-outraged/). This story and all others are not sourced. However, when you copy the text of the article, you find that it again is plagiarized from another source. In this case, it was copied from the local USA newspaper, the [Times-News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-news-idaho/). Essentially, they copy the text and then run it through a re-wording or translation app that changes up the text in a way that is very difficult to read but is still the same information. Whether rewording the article or not, if you do not give credit to the source, you are plagiarizing. In general, this is a pro-Trump conservative website that has zero credibility.
