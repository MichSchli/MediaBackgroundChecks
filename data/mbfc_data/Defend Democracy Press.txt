Analysis / Bias
Two representative articles help to illustrate the outlet’s bias. The first article, “
[Don’t Let the Saudis Off the Hook for the Migrant Massacres](https://www.defenddemocracy.press/dont-let-the-saudis-off-the-hook-for-the-migrant-massacres/),” criticizes the [Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) administration for its inaction regarding the reported killing of migrants by Saudi forces. The article uses reputable sources such as [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/#google_vignette) and [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/). However, it employs strong, emotionally loaded language like “massacring,” framing the U.S. as complicit through its lack of action.
The second article,
[“A 32-Hour Workweek Is Long Overdue,”](https://www.defenddemocracy.press/a-32-hour-workweek-is-long-overdue/) advocates for a shorter, government-mandated workweek, aligning with Bernie Sanders’ known progressive views on labor issues. The article’s tone and language are notably pro-labor and left-leaning. The piece portrays those who disagree as misguided, explicitly advocating for political action to benefit the working class. The article cites a range of sources, including [Stacker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stacker-bias/), callaborlaw.com, leginfo.legislature.ca.gov, marxists.org, and Scott Shackford of [Reason Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/) is also mentioned. Still, his critique is dismissed as off-topic, further indicating the article’s left-leaning bias. The use of emotionally charged language and biased framing favors left-leaning policies, particularly in the areas of social justice, anti-imperialism, and human rights, while criticizing right-leaning or conservative policies.
In general, Defend Democracy Press holds left-leaning viewpoints such as this
