And in many respects, we have already achieved so much more.” [Read our media and government profile for the UK.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, NewsBiscuit publishes satirical content such as this
[BORIS STILL WORKING TOWARDS A DARWIN AWARD](http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2020/04/10/draft-boris-working-towards-a-darwin-award/) and this [NATION DEMANDS HUGH GRANT STAND IN FOR BORIS](http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2020/04/08/nation-demands-hugh-grant-stand-in-for-boris/). As seen by these two quick examples satire tends to poke fun at the right. While NewsBiscuit does not openly disclaim they are satire, a view of headlines should be enough for most people. In general, this is a satire site that has survived for almost 18 years and that is impressive in our review experience.
