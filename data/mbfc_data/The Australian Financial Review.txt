Analysis / Bias
In the 2019 elections, according to its editorial,
[“For all its faults, the Coalition faces in the right policy direction,”](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/for-all-its-faults-the-coalition-faces-in-the-right-policy-direction-20190515-p51njp) The Australian Financial Review (AFR) endorsed Scott Morrison’s center-right Coalition party.
In review, The Australian Financial Review (AFR) publishes news with story selection that moderately favors the right, such as this:
[“For Labor, the end of the beginning is nigh”](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/for-labor-the-end-of-the-beginning-is-nigh-20191011-p52zpa) and criticizing big government such as “ [Big government’s now infectious.”](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/big-government-s-about-to-get-infectious-too-20200318-p54baw) When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone [“Trump is not the right man for this crisis”](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-is-not-the-right-man-for-this-crisis-20200702-p558iz) and [“Coronavirus could kill off populism.”](https://www.afr.com/politics/coronavirus-could-kill-off-populism-20200630-p557hw) AFR typically sources credible media such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 57% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 12% do not, ranking them #6 in trust of the major Australian news providers. In general, reporting is factual with a right-leaning editorial bias.
