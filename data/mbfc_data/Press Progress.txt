History
[Founded in 2013](http://whois.domaintools.com/pressprogress.ca), Press Progress is an online news and analysis website, which is a project of the Broadbent Institute that seeks to provide an online Progressive Political news source. According to their [about page](https://pressprogress.ca/about-us/) “Our work focuses on investigative reporting, fact-checking and keeping tabs on issues that don’t get enough attention. We aim to break original stories that Canada’s big news outlets miss and advance stories on issues that matter to our progressive readership.” [Read our profile on Canada’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canada-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Press Progress reports news and opinions that are favorable to the left. There is the frequent use of loaded language that favors the left such as this:
[10 Cruel and Unusual Ways Doug Ford Has Made Life Worse ‘For the People’ of Ontario Since Last Year’s Election](https://pressprogress.ca/10-cruel-and-unusual-ways-doug-ford-has-made-life-worse-for-the-people-of-ontario-since-last-years-election/). This story is appropriately sourced to credible outlets such as the [Toronto Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-star/), [CBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/), and the [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/).
In general, story selection always favors the left and denigrates the right through the use of emotional language such as this:
[Conservative Witness for ‘Online Hate’ Hearing Was a Recent Guest on a White Nationalist’s YouTube Channel](https://pressprogress.ca/conservative-witness-for-online-hate-hearing-was-a-recent-guest-on-a-white-nationalists-youtube-channel/). This story is also properly sourced to credible media outlets, though the wording is emotional.
