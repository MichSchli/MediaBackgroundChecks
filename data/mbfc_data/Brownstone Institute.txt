The Brownstone Institute advocates for libertarian government and Austrian economic theory.
[They claim to be](https://brownstone.org/about/) “the spiritual child of the Great Barrington Declaration.” [The Great Barrington Declaration](https://gbdeclaration.org/) comes from the Libertarian Think Tank, [The American Institute for Economic Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-institute-for-economic-research/). Scientists have criticized the Great Barrington Declaration as dangerous and controversial due to its opposition to lockdowns, masks, and vaccine mandates. The Brownstone Institute states that it “looks to influence a post-lockdown world by generating new ideas in public health, scientific discourse, economics, and social theory.”
The website features news and opinion articles that use loaded emotional wording favoring the libertarian right, such as this

Editorially, they advocate for limited government, free-market capitalism, and libertarian policy. During the covid-19 pandemic, they promoted vaccine hesitancy, such as why
[I Will Not Take the Second Dose](https://brownstone.org/articles/why-i-will-not-take-the-second-dose/). They have also promoted misinformation and made false claims about vaccines (see fact checks below). In general, they are right-biased and sometimes promote misinformation.
