Analysis / Bias
Most articles favor the right and are anti-left. There is the moderate use of emotionally loaded words in headlines such as: “
[Hypocrisy in Liberal Racism](http://www.americanlibertyreport.com/articles/hypocrisy-in-liberal-racism/),” and there is very little sourcing. American Liberty Report utilizes quotes vs. links, making it difficult to verify the context and facts of the information.
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have promoted misleading information such as this
[Bombshell: Spanish Nursing Homes Beat COVID with Zero Deaths, Hospitalizations, or Vaccines.](https://www.americanlibertyemail.com/articles/bombshell-spanish-nursing-homes-beat-covid-with-zero-deaths-hospitalizations-or-vaccines/) In this article, they encourage unproven pseudoscience without a single link to a source “The only treatment that 75% of them received as cheap allergy medicine, a Z-Pac prescription, Tylenol and a baking-soda-and-water gargle.” [This is false](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-alkaline-idUSKBN20X2BV).
