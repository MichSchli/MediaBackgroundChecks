Analysis / Bias
In review, under their “news” tab, I Bleed Red White and Blue republishes news directly from the right leaning-factually mixed,
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). They also publish interviews with conservative figures and provide links to view our country’s [founding documents](http://ibleedredwhiteblue.com/founding-documents/). Under the “videos” tab they publish video clips from other news outlets such as such as [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) or [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/), often with biased or misleading headlines that favor the right, such as this: [Democrat Ilhan Omar “Gleefully discussing Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&v=uWT-JorQnZQ)
In general, when reporting news, I Bleed Red White and Blue does not use original content but rather republishes from the Daily Caller, which is right-biased and has
