Analysis / Bias
The New York Amsterdam News publishes editorials with the use of strongly loaded words such as this:
[“Make America Great Again—Trump Must Go! #97”](http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/dec/13/make-america-great-againtrump-must-go-97/) and “ [Murderers have a right to counsel—but not immigrants.”](http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/dec/06/murderers-have-right-counsel-not-immigrants/) When reporting straight news, they use minimally loaded words in headlines and articles: [Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney, sentenced to three years.](http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/dec/13/michael-cohen-trumps-former-attorney-sentenced-thr/) This story does not provide hyperlinked sourcing; however, it is accurate based on searching [credible news wires](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cohen-sentence/former-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-sentenced-to-three-years-prison-idUSKBN1OB2AR).
We found some other stories on the website that did not provide hyperlinked sourcing, but they did indicate that the stories came from credible left-leaning sources such as
[Propublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/) and the [ACLU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-civil-liberties-union-aclu/). When reporting local news, [“Hundreds of kids receive presents, meet Santa at toy giveaway in Harlem”](http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2018/dec/19/hundreds-kids-receive-presents-meet-santa-toy-give/) they typically use [WPIX 11 NEWS](https://pix11.com/2018/12/18/hundreds-of-kids-receive-presents-meet-santa-at-toy-giveaway-in-harlem/), a New York City-based TV station and website.
