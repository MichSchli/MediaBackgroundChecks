Launched in 2009 by
[Hu Shuli](https://www.forbes.com/profile/hu-shuli/#4704ea421f03), [The Beijing-based](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-caixin-fundraising/chinese-news-outlet-caixin-aims-to-raise-up-to-200-million-for-tech-development-growth-sources-idUSKCN1RL0E4) Caixin Global provides business and financial news about China. In 2009, Hu Shuli resigned from a financial news magazine called [Caijing magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2009/11/the-other-shoe-drops-at-caijing/29818/), also founded by her. In 2010, she established Caixin Media Company Limited, followed by an English-language news site called “Caixin Online.”
According to its
[about page](https://corp.caixin.com/aboutus_en/), Caixin Media Company Limited provides “financial and business news through periodicals, online content, mobile apps, conferences, books, and TV/video programs” through “integrated multimedia platforms.” Caixin Online grew into Claxin Global, which [provides](https://intelligence.caixinglobal.com/) “intelligence and consultancy services, bespoke research, and a conference and network platform.” In 2013, according to a Variety [article](https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/li-ruigangs-cmc-buys-stake-in-caixin-media-1200978643/), “Li Ruigang’s CMC Buys Stake in Caixin Media.”
In 2019, Reuters described Caixin as “backed by tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd and investment firm China Media Capital (CMC).” China Media Capital is owned by Li Ruigang, who is also the Chairman. The current Editor-in-Chief is

[China Media Capital (CMC)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chinese-entertainment-firm-cmc-raises-15-billion-tencent-alibaba-1124677) holds large stakes in Caixin, as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and [Hollywood Reporter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hollywood-reporter/) reported. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1297401/000129740112000004/exhibit991pressrelease21712.htm) indicates that “CMC Capital’s prominent founding partners include China Development Bank (CDB), one of China’s largest financial institutions.” Known as China’s Rupert Murdoch, [Li Ruigang](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/6095128) is also a member of the Communist Party of China. In 2018, Hu Shuli stepped down from the [editor position](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/ap-interview-chinese-editor-hu-shuli-steps-aside-not-down). Revenue is derived through a [paywall subscription model](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-caixin-fundraising/chinese-news-outlet-caixin-aims-to-raise-up-to-200-million-for-tech-development-growth-sources-idUSKCN1RL0E4).
Analysis / Bias
[Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/china) states, “President Xi Jinping has successfully imposed a social model in China based on control of news and information and online surveillance of its citizens. At the same time, he has been trying to export this oppressive model by promoting a “new world media order” under China’s influence.” According to their 2022 report, China ranks 177 out of 180, equating to almost zero press freedom.
In review, most articles pertaining to the Communist Government are favorable to President Xi Jinping. In other words, the content you find on the website is generally factual and neutral in tone. Still, the consistent bias by omission makes Caixin Global a factually Mixed propaganda source. For example,
[“Xi Jinping Calls for Unity Between China, the U.S. in Pandemic Fight](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-27/xi-jinping-calls-for-unity-between-china-us-in-pandemic-fight-101535122.html)” and [“Xi Jinping Says ‘No One Will Emerge as a Winner’ in a Trade War.”](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-07-26/xi-jinping-says-no-one-will-emerge-as-a-winner-in-a-trade-war-101308505.html) An example is a business-related news article, [“ByteDance Seeks New Investment Opportunities Amid Global TikTok Pushbacks](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-07-23/bytedance-seeks-new-investment-opportunities-amid-global-tiktok-pushbacks-101583742.html).” Further, when sourcing, they typically utilize the factually mixed Chinese state-run press agency [Xinhua News Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/xinhua-news-agency/) and [weixin.qq.com/](https://weixin.qq.com/) “WeChat,” a Chinese messaging app that the Government heavily censors. Caixin also utilizes credible western news sources such as centerforhealthsecurity.org and [CNBC.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/)
Caixin Global, the English language arm of Caixin Media, also has a content-sharing
[partnership](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-04-01/caixin-global-enters-content-partnership-with-the-straits-times-101399640.html) with [The Straits Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-straits-times/) and [The Australian Financial Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-australian-financial-review/), both rated as right-center biased by Media Bias Fact check. In addition, the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), along with CNBC, and [Market Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/marketwatch/), is among their [media partners](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-10-08/caixin-global-australian-financial-review-announce-partnership-101332623.html). When reporting news pertaining to the USA, Caixin Global utilizes emotionally loaded words in their articles with a negative tone toward the Trump administration [“In-Depth: How the U.S. Missed Its Window for Taming the Covid-19 Virus.” ](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-16/in-depth-how-the-us-missed-its-window-for-taming-the-covid-19-virus-101528836.html) In general, the news is reported factually; however, it is misleading due to strong censorship of anything negative toward China.
