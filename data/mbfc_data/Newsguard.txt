Analysis / Bias
Newsguard reviews and rates media and information sources using a 100-point scale. Each source is rated on
[9 different criteria](https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/criteria-for-and-explanation-of-ratings/) and with each criterion having a [different weight](https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/criteria-for-and-explanation-of-ratings/) that totals 100 for a perfect score. Any score of 60 or above will be given a green shield, and those below 60 will receive a red shield. Newsguard also provides a “Nutrition Label” to explain how they came to their conclusions. The nutrition label is well-sourced and offers examples to support its claims.
In review, Newsguard reviews media websites and rates them according to the criteria listed above. The information provided on their nutrition labels is thorough and appropriately sourced. They also do not use loaded words and maintain a neutral tone in their reviews. We found that many sources are given a
[green shield](https://api.newsguardtech.com/EFC195FBC1C30DD694678E7503609EC66805EBAD8C103EF0ECE2776285EE610E150BBF35C00BFC1FE2DBAE6D3A0382C1352D93A57BA3E8E7?cid=4f49df59-b789-40b9-9950-bfc914ac58e7) rating that we rate [Mixed for factual reporting.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) This indicates that they have a different standard in their ratings.
Perhaps a yellow shield would be appropriate for transparent sources that occasionally publish misleading information, or as we rate them, “Factually Mixed.” Newsguard does not factor bias into their ratings, though they will mention it on their nutrition label. The primary focus of the ratings is on transparency and lack of deception, such as labeling advertising and separating opinions from news pieces.
Newsguard has faced both
[criticism](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/01/23/microsoft-teams-with-establishment-newsguard-to-create-news-blacklist/) and [praise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2019/01/16/newsguard-gets-a-leg-up-in-the-war-on-real-fake-news/#7ac4e9966f57). The number one criticism of Newsguard is that some sites that many perceive as being untrustworthy were given a [green shield](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/08/newsguard-considers-fox-news-a-healthy-part-of-your-news-diet/), and some sources that people find trustworthy were given a [red shield](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/newsguard-nuzzelrank-media-ratings-fake-news.html) ( [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/)). Breitbart News has criticized NewsGuard as “the establishment media’s latest effort to blacklist alternative media sites” Newsguard [denies this claim](https://mspoweruser.com/unlike-reality-newsguard-denies-a-bias-against-conservatives/).
In general, Newsguard provides well-sourced evidence-based information and adheres to established criteria.
