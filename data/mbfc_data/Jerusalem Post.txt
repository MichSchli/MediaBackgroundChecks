History
The Jerusalem Post is an English-language daily newspaper based in Jerusalem, Israel. It was founded by Ukrainian-born American immigrant to Palestine,
[Gershon Agron](https://www.jpost.com/features/in-thespotlight/this-week-in-history-the-palestine-post-is-established) in 1932, and originally published as the “Palestine Post” and in the British mandate of Palestine. In 1950 the name changed to The Jerusalem Post.

Funded by / Ownership
In 1989, the paper was purchased by
[ Hollinger Inc.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conrad-black-through-the-years-1.868133#:~:text=1989,in%20Israel%2C%20for%20%2417%20million.) for $17-million, which Canadian-born British Conservative Conrad Black owned. Conrad Black later was [charged with](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/conrad-black-pardon.html) “swindling his company, Hollinger International, of $60 million.” He was serving a prison sentence; however, in 2019, President Donald Trump pardoned him.
Mirkaei Tikshoret Group Ltd, jointly with CanWest, purchased the Jerusalem Post from Hollinger International in 2004 for
[$13.2 million.](https://www.haaretz.com/1.4758288) Later, CanWest [lost](https://web.archive.org/web/20121025041543/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-124755737.html) its 50% share to Mirkaei Tikshoret Group Ltd.

Analysis
Until 1989, the Jerusalem Post’s political leaning was left-leaning as it supported the
[ruling Labor Party](https://www.jpost.com/israel/the-story-behind-the-headlines). After Conrad Black acquired the paper, its political position changed to right-leaning, when Black began hiring conservative journalists and editors. Eli Azur is the current owner of Jerusalem Post. According to Ynetnews, and a [Haaretz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/haaretz/) article, [“Benjamin Netanyahu, the Editor in Chief,”](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-benjamin-netanyahu-the-editor-in-chief-1.8537315) in 2017, [Azur gave testimony](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4942634,00.html) regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pressure. Current Editor Yaakov Katz was the former [senior policy advisor](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/yaakov-katz-named-new-post-editor-in-chief-451136) to [Naftali Bennett](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-defence/israels-netanyahu-appoints-far-right-bennett-as-defense-minister-idUSKBN1XI1VZ), the former Prime Minister and head of the far-right political party, “New Right.”
Bias
In review, The Jerusalem Post covers Israeli and regional news with strongly emotionally loaded language with right-leaning bias with articles such as this
[“Country’s founding Labor party survives near extinction”](https://www.jpost.com/israel-elections/countrys-founding-labor-party-survives-near-extinction-602032) and [“Netanyahu slams settler leader for insulting Trump.” ](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/netanyahu-slams-settler-leader-for-insulting-trump-630217) The Jerusalem Post also criticizes the [Associated Press:](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) “ [The Associated Press cooperated with Hitler’s Nazi regime, historian claims](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/the-associated-press-cooperated-with-hitlers-nazi-regime-historian-claims-449715).” When it comes to sourcing the Jerusalem Post sources to itself and using large quotes from [the New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the [Jewish Telegraphic Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency-jta/).
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Jerusalem%20post&gsc.sort=) reveals one Unsupported claim. However, on 9/4/2019, the Jerusalem Post published a false story that claimed Canada would receive 100,000 Palestinians from Lebanon. The Canadian Government denied this and asked the Jerusalem Post to [correct their story](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/US-has-agreement-with-Canada-to-accept-100000-Palestinians-Arab-report-600602), which they did.
During the 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict, the majority of stories favored the Israeli government, such as this
[Netanyahu to Hezbollah: If you attack, we’ll turn Beirut into Gaza](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-777132). In general, the Jerusalem Post holds right-leaning editorial biases and is usually factual in reporting.
