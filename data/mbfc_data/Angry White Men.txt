Analysis / Bias
Angry White Men occasionally uses strong, loaded language in their headlines and articles, such as this:
[Lauren Southern’s ‘Farmlands’ Is Lazy, Dishonest, And Racist.](https://angrywhitemen.org/2018/09/09/lauren-southerns-farmlands-is-lazy-dishonest-and-racist/) Although the wording conveys bias, the articles are all well-sourced with credible information.
The website also offers a section called
[Cucktionary](https://angrywhitemen.org/cucktionary/) that defines terms that are used to “expose white nationalists, adherents of the alt-right movement, and other neo-reactionaries.” Angry White Men also offers their blog roll, which consists of mostly left-leaning sources such as [Media Matters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-matters/) and [Think Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/think-progress/) and least biased sources such as [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/). In general, the information is usually factual and holds a strong left-leaning bias.
