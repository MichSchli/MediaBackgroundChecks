Analysis / Bias
In review, Fabiosa publishes clickbait sensationalized news stories with emotional wording such as this:
[85-Year-Old Woman Survives Hurricane Dorian After Floating In Her Chair For 3 Days In Rising Waters: “She Is A Living Miracle](https://fabiosa.com/ctnws-rsyml-ausmk-pbsmk-phemk-85-year-old-woman-survives-hurricane-dorian-after-floating-in-the-ocean-in-her-chair-for-3-days-she-is-a-living/).” Fabiosa rarely covers political news; however, they do cover political figures in a sensational manner such as this: [Book Claims Melania And Ivanka Trump Don’t Get Along Well, But Ivana Trump Says Her Daughter “Likes” Melania](https://fabiosa.com/ctentlfs-rsvlk-auvkl-pbvkl-phakl-melania-and-ivanka-trump-don-t-get-along-well-behind-the-scenes-biographer-claims/).
Fabiosa also reports on alternative health that promotes pseudoscience. For example, they promote that
[essential oils](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-essential-oils/) can cure cancer [What Oncologists Keep Silent About: Essential Oils Can Be Very Effective Against Cancer](https://fabiosa.com/lbmkt-ctlf-rslpr-audkz-pbmts-what-oncologists-keep-silent-about-essential-oils-can-be-very-effective-against-cancer/). There isn’t [medical evidence](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) to support this claim. In general, they report sensationalized stories that are not always factual.
