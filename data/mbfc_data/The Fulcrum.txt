Analysis / Bias
In review, The Fulcrum produces original content that focuses on improving the democratic process of elections. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded language such as this
[Pennsylvania may decide the election but has to decide many rules first](https://thefulcrum.us/absentee-voting-pennsylvania). This story is correctly sourced to local accounts. In another related story, [Trump campaign sues Pennsylvania over easier absentee voting](https://thefulcrum.us/voting/absentee-voting-pennsylvania-2646299405); they utilize emotional language to frame former President Trump negatively, such as this “President Trump is taking his crusade against voting by mail to a new level.”
Editorially, The Fulcrum publishes stories and positions that favor a liberal perspective such as this:
[How Trump is turning the American presidency into a dictatorship](https://thefulcrum.us/voting/absentee-voting-pennsylvania-2646299405), and this [Why not allow us to use whatever polling place we find most convenient?](https://thefulcrum.us/voting/voting-locations) Finally, The Fulcrum is opposed to [Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC), which some claim gives corporations personhood in the election process; [Amendment to nullify Citizens United finally gets air time in the House](https://thefulcrum.us/campaign-finance/citizens-united-28th-amendment). In general, The Fulcrum produces fact-based content from a strong left-center perspective.
