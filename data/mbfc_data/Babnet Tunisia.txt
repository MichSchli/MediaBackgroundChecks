Analysis / Bias
Currently,
[Kais Saied](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tunisia-media-profile/) is the President of Tunisia; he is a law professor by training and known as a [Populist](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/world/middleeast/tunisia-president-kais-saied.html). Tunisia has been in political turmoil since Saied [sacked](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/tunisian-democracy-crisis-after-president-ousts-government-2021-07-26/) the government in July 2021, suspended parliament with the army’s help, and assumed executive authority that political parties widely criticized as a “coup.”
Babnet.net publishes articles regarding the President with a positive tone, such as
[“The President of the Republic..“The implementing orders related to the “Feda Foundation” decree will be issued in the near future.”](https://www.babnet.net/cadredetail-244773.asp) When reporting on other political parties, Babnet uses a neutral tone as in this article [In his meeting with Ghannouchi … Chebbi presents his initiative to form a “National Salvation Front](https://www.babnet.net/rttdetail-244782.asp). In the article, they report with minimal editorializing about a leading member of the Al-Amal Party, Ahmed Najib Chebbi who wants to form a big tent movement by meeting with The Ennahda Movement (Islamic Democratic Party) leader Rached Ghannouchi. Chebbi is critical of the president, as reported by other [media outlets](https://news-tunisia.tunisienumerique.com/tunisia-nejib-chebbi-kais-saied-has-become-a-real-danger-for-tunisia-audio/).
Finally, when it comes to sourcing, they do not provide hyperlinks but instead use quotations, which does not meet our standard for proper sourcing of information. The news is generally reported with minimal bias, but it is not possible to verify all information due to a lack of sourcing.
