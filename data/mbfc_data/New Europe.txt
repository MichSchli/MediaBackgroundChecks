Their headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium. [Basil Coronakis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2017/12/21/un-votes-128-9-reject-us-decision-jerusalem/) founded the New Europe (newspaper) and served as its Editor and CEO until 2008.

Analysis / Bias
In review, New Europe reports news related to Europe and the European Union. They use minimally loaded language in their headlines “
[Why Romania could be next”](https://www.neweurope.eu/article/why-romania-could-be-next/) and typically, they use large quotations without providing links to their sources. Such as: “As reported by Romania Insider, the president also said he had not yet spoken with Laura Codruţa Kovesi, head of the Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), or other chief prosecutors about the justice laws. The justice minister should do this, Iohannis said.” Further, New Europe also utilizes credible sources such as [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/roma), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/).
When it comes to US politics their word choices are anti-Trump, such as
[“Europe’s far-right welcomes Trump’s Muslim immigration ban”](https://www.neweurope.eu/article/europes-far-right-welcomes-trumps-muslim-immigration-ban/) and [America’s new civil war (II)](https://www.neweurope.eu/article/americas-new-civil-war-ii/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
