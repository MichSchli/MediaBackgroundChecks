Analysis / Bias
In review, the Columbus Free Press utilizes strongly loaded language in headlines and articles that favor the left:
[Convicted Trumputin Consigliere Paul Manafort Linked to Ohio’s Stolen 2004 Election.](http://freepress.org/article/convicted-trumputin-consigliere-paul-manafort-linked-ohios-stolen-2004-election) There is also minimal sourcing in this article. In another article, they link to a strongly left-biased source [progressive.org](https://columbusfreepress.com/article/did-gop-strip-flip-2016-selection). The op-ed page contains little balance, with almost all topics favoring the left. Further, some [op-eds](https://columbusfreepress.com/article/cooperative-capitalism) contain zero sourcing of information.
While we can find no evidence of failed fact checks, the reporting is entirely one-sided and sometimes not appropriately sourced to credible outlets.
