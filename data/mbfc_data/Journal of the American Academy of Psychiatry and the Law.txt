Analysis / Bias
The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law is an internally reviewed journal that publishes information on Forensic Psychiatry. The journal primarily publishes research such as this:
[Adjudicative Competence in the Context of a Defendant’s Absence from Trial after a Suicide Attempt](https://jaapl.org/content/51/4/558).
While JAAPL is primarily a scientific publication, it also produces more opinion-orientated content that usually favors a liberal perspective such as this
[A Comprehensive Framework to Advance Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in a Forensic Service](https://jaapl.org/content/51/4/486) and [Assessing Racial Effects on Adjudicative Competence](https://jaapl.org/content/51/4/542). Both of these pieces are solidly backed with credible scientific evidence.
In general, JAAPL holds a left-leaning bias in favor of social equity and justice, while all content reviewed is fact-based and properly sourced.
