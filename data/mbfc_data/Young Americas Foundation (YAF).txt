Analysis / Bias
In review, Young America’s Foundation publishes articles that almost always favor the right. There is the moderate use of loaded language such as this:
[Cornell Leftists Predictably Lose Touch With Reality Ahead of YAF Lecture by VP Dick Cheney](https://www.yaf.org/news/cornell-leftists-predictably-lose-touch-with-reality-ahead-of-yaf-lecture-by-vp-dick-cheney/). YAF usually sources its information from credible sources. However, we found instances of them publishing false information to advance an anti-abortion position. See failed fact checks.
