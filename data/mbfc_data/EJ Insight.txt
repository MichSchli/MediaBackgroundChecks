Analysis / Bias
EJ Insight’s reporting regarding regional news is biased against the Hong Kong Government. In contrast, its news reporting under the World News International category regarding US politics favors a left-leaning perspective such as this
[America’s Republicans are killing their voters](https://www.ejinsight.com/eji/article/id/2861957/20210726-America%E2%80%99s-Republicans-are-killing-their-voters). This story is republished from Project Syndicate, which MBFC rates as Left-Center Biased.
Editorially, most stories favor the left, such as this
[Create smart environment to achieve carbon neutrality](https://www.ejinsight.com/eji/article/id/2877124/20210809-Create-smart-environment-to-achieve-carbon-neutrality) and [Delusions of power](https://www.ejinsight.com/eji/article/id/2860529/20210723-Delusions-of-power) which is critical of right-wing authoritarian politicians and governments. Hong Kong is under the control of the Chinese government and, over the last few years, has lost almost all press freedom; therefore, it is rare to find criticism of the Chinese government on this website.
