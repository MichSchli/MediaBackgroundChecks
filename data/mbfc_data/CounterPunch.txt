History
[Founded in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CounterPunch), CounterPunch is a bi-monthly magazine published in the United States that covers politics in a manner its editors describe as “muckraking with a radical attitude.” It has been described as left-wing by both [supporters and detractors](https://newrepublic.com/article/60975/the-devil-you-know). The current editors are [Jeffrey St. Clair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_St._Clair) and [Joshua Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Frank).
During the 2016 presidential election, CounterPunch published the writings of Alice Donovan, who purported to be a freelance writer but was, in fact, a pseudonymous employee of the
[Russian government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kremlin-trolls-burned-across-the-internet-as-washington-debated-options/2017/12/23/e7b9dc92-e403-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.1595f52a3fcd). Following this, CounterPunch wrote a follow-up article: “St. Clair and Frank exposed a network of alleged trolls that operated a site called Inside Syria Media Center promoting a pro-Bashar al-Assad and pro-Russian view of the Syrian Civil War. St. Clair and Frank speculated that the website was connected to the same network of trolls as Alice Donovan.”
CounterPunch has also been
[accused](https://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/25/guardian-praises-anti-semitic-site-counterpunch-as-progressive/) of Antisemitism, which stemmed from an [interview](https://www.haaretz.com/roger-waters-sets-the-record-straight-1.5381170) with Roger Waters.

Analysis / Bias
In review, CounterPunch presents news and opinions with a strong progressive left bias in story selection. Most stories favor the left and use loaded language such as
[The Blob Fought the Squad, and the Squad Won](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/07/19/the-blob-fought-the-squad-and-the-squad-won/) and [The Immoral Silence to the Destructive Xenophobia of “Just Leave.”](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/07/19/the-immoral-silence-to-the-destructive-xenophobia-of-just-leave/) This last piece does not indicate an opinion article and provides zero hyperlinked sources to vet those opinions. CounterPunch also regularly praises and highlights [Julian Assange of Wikileaks](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/07/19/in-crisis-of-democracy-we-all-must-become-julian-assange/), who outright lied and created the [Seth Rich conspiracy theory](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-report-julian-assange-smeared-seth-rich-to-cover-for-russians). CounterPunch favors Democratic Socialism such as [Bernie Sanders, Anti-Imperialism, and Venezuela](https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/07/18/bernie-sanders-anti-imperialism-and-venezuela/) regarding politics.
The general editorial position of CounterPunch is Left and is usually rooted in fact.
