Analysis / Bias
American Crime Journal (ACJ) specializes in crime-related stories and investigative journalism. The first article reviewed on Lance Gilman and Tim Ballard’s involvement with O.U.R., titled:
[“Owner of Nevada Brothel Became ‘Major Stakeholder’ In Operation Underground Railroad”](https://americancrimejournal.com/owner-of-nevada-brothel-became-major-stakeholder-in-operation-underground-railroad/) uses emotionally loaded language that leans towards a sensationalist narrative. Phrases such as “tableau of moral decadence and perversion” and “specters of alcohol, cocaine, and strippers” are prominent. Although detailed, the reporting relies on dramatic storytelling rather than objective reporting.
The second article,
[“Second lawsuit against Tim Ballard, OUR & others,”](https://americancrimejournal.com/acj-investigates/operation-underground-railroad-o-u-r/second-lawsuit-against-tim-ballard-our-others/) discusses a second lawsuit against Tim Ballard and O.U.R. involving allegations of sexual assault and fraud. The article lacks direct source citations. However, the existence and details of the [lawsuit](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2023/10/11/second-lawsuit-accuses-tim-ballard/) are corroborated by external reports, like those from the [Salt Lake Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salt-lake-tribune/), lending some credibility to the information presented.
Lastly, the article
[“Rambo Reyes & O.U.R.: The Colombian Rescue Mission”](https://americancrimejournal.com/rambo-reyes-o-u-r-the-columbian-rescue-mission/) extensively uses quotes from various sources, including major media outlets like [ABC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/), [Rolling Stone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rolling-stone/), [CBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) and spokespersons from organizations like ICE, to build its narrative. While this approach provides various perspectives, the absence of source hyperlinks is a significant hindrance to direct source verification.
Editorially, more stories favor the left, especially as it relates to criticism of Tim Ballard, who is
[closely tied](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5yjq4/tim-ballard-out-as-ceo-at-glenn-beck-backed-nazarene-fund) to conservative commentator [Glenn Beck](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/glenn-beck-bias-rating/) and QAnon conspiracy theories. Therefore, ACJ holds a left-leaning bias and is mostly factual in reporting due to not properly sourcing information.
