Analysis / Bias
In review, Military Times covers military news and defense policy using minimally loaded language such as this:
[Navy SEAL scheduled to plead guilty in strangling death of Army Green Beret staff sergeant](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/05/13/navy-seal-scheduled-to-plead-guilty-in-strangling-death-of-army-green-beret-staff-sergeant/), and [A West Point investigator died during an Army PT test](https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/05/03/a-west-point-investigator-died-during-an-army-pt-test/). All information in articles is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and .gov sites. In general, Military Times serves as a portal for news stories published on Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps Times. Editorially, they are balanced with primarily centrist views that slightly lean left on gender and lean right in their support of military strength. In general, Army Times covers military news with very low bias in reporting.
