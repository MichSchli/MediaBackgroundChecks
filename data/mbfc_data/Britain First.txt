History
Founded in 2011, Britain First is a
[far-right and British ultranationalist political party](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-05/a-day-with-alt-right-britain-first/8324680) and movement formed by former members of the British National Party (BNP). The party was founded by Jim Dowson, an anti-abortion campaigner linked to [Ulster loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) groups in Northern Ireland. Britain First campaigns primarily against multiculturalism and what it sees as the Islamisation of the United Kingdom and advocates the preservation of traditional British culture.
In 2018, they were banned by Facebook for inciting
[hatred against minorities](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17119058/britain-first-facebook-banned-racist-hate-speech). [Read our profile on UK media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In reviewing their news content, it is clear that this source has an extreme
[anti-Islamic bias](http://www.britainfirst.tv/saudi-arabia-funding-terrorist-breeding-mosques-ex-uk-ambassador-to-riyadh/). Britain First has a poor track record with fact-checkers due to their promotion of [propaganda](http://www.snopes.com/london-donald-trump-sadiq-khan-london-mayor/) and has also failed several fact checks from UK-based checkers such as this [one](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-no-muslims-in-london-didnt-celebrate-the-paris-attack). See examples below. The Britain First leader has also been [found guilty](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-43320121) of committing a hate crime.
In 2019, Britain First supported conservative Boris Johnson
[Britain First urges supporters to join Conservative Party ‘to make Boris Johnson’s leadership more secure](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-far-right-extremists-join-conservatives-support-britain-first-a9252201.html).’ However, they have also been criticized for setting up Christian Patrols to both bait and [intimidate Muslims](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/farright-group-filmed-on-patrol-at-east-end-mosque-9110934.html). [Other sources and organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain_First) have labeled Britain First as Fascist, Xenophobic, Racist, and Islamophobic.
Further, the
[Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) [states](https://www.adl.org/blog/britain-first-what-you-need-to-know) they have ties Neo-Nazis and are “a virulently anti-Muslim group.” In short, they indicate they are a propaganda-driven hate group. In general, Britain First is not credible, is right biased, and is low factual.
Failed Fact Checks

In summary, Britain First is a far-right nationalist group with an extreme anti-immigrant bias that some classify as a
