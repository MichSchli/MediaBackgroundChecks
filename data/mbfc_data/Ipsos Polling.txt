Analysis / Bias
In review, the site publishes surveys and research on EU-funded projects such as
[here](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/montenegro/ipsos-research-more-60-citizens-prefer-go-counter-rather-use-e-services_en?s=225). Generally, they publish the surveys with minimal bias in wording like [“52% globally say cycling in their area is too dangerous](https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-advisor-cycling-across-the-world-2022),” This survey is properly sourced to reports, with the reports available to download. However, the downloaded version is the same as the PowerPoint presentation report; in other words, there is no detail in the downloaded version.
Ipsos also uses moderately loaded language in some headlines such as this:
[ “America’s hidden common ground on police reform and racism in the United States.”](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-poll/public-agenda-hidden-common-ground-police-reform) For this research, Ipsos partnered with Public Agenda, the National Issues Forums Institute, the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, and [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/).
[FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/), an expert on measuring and rating pollster performance, has [evaluated 111 polls by Ipsos,](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/ipsos/) indicating they are accurate 68% of the time or Mostly Factual. They also conclude that their polling favors the left with a score of +1.8, which equates to a Left-Center bias in polling. In general, Ipsos is a reasonably accurate pollster that slightly favors the left (Democratic Candidates).
