[organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Vaccine_Information_Center) that has been widely criticized as a leading source of vaccine misinformation. [They claim](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/03/vaccine-map-exemption-bills/) to be the “oldest and largest consumer-led organization advocating for the institution of vaccine safety and informed consent protections.” The organization promotes vaccine misinformation as its primary mission and holds a right-leaning bias politically.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is a quackery-level anti-vaccination organization. The website’s entire premise is to encourage parents and adults not to vaccinate. They routinely promote perceived dangers that science does not accept and advocate campaigns such as
[displaying billboards](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/03/15/vaccines_and_autism_antivaccination_group_advertising_on_billboards.html) along highways. Further, NVIC also claims a partnership with known pseudoscience purveyor [Joseph Mercola](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/03/15/vaccines_and_autism_antivaccination_group_advertising_on_billboards.html). This source also [promotes](https://www.nvic.org/nvic-archives/newsletter/autismandvaccines.aspx) the debunked claim that [ vaccines cause autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). NVIC lacks credibility because they promote anti-vaccine pseudoscience and misinformation.
