They are owned by NBCUniversal News Group, an NBCUniversal division, which is both owned by Comcast. Outside of news reporting, MSNBC features hosted news programs such as “All In with [Chris Hayes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/chris-hayes-bias-rating/),” “Hardball with Chris Matthews,” and “The Rachel Maddow Show,” hosted by liberal pundit Rachel Maddow. MSNBC also has moderate conservatives, namely Morning Joe’s, [Joe Scarborough](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-scarborbough-bias-rating/), co-hosted by liberal commentator [Mika Brzezinski](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mika-brzezinski-bias-rating/).

Funded by / Ownership
The MSNBC news outlet was established in 1996 by a
[merger](https://variety.com/1995/tv/features/nbc-microsoft-make-news-with-joint-venture-cable-web-99123538/) between Microsoft (MS) and NBC. In 2005, [Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/24/business/media/microsoft-quits-msnbc-tv-but-web-partnership-remains.html) ended their partnership with MSNBC TV, but the web partnership remained until 2012, when Microsoft and NBC [completely separated](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/media/msnbccom-renamed-nbcnewscom-as-microsoft-and-nbc-divorce.html) from each other. NBC was owned jointly by Comcast and GE until 2011, when [Comcast completed its merger with NBC Universal,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-nbc/comcast-completes-nbc-universal-merger-idUSTRE70S2WZ20110129) becoming the sole owner. Comcast’s chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are [Brian L. Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_L._Roberts), founded by his father, Ralph J. Roberts. Advertising and cable/satellite broadcasting fees generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, MSNBC uses strong emotionally loaded headlines such as this
[“GOP senator says he’s ‘concerned’ Trump was ‘involved in a crime”](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senator-says-hes-concerned-trump-was-involved-crime) and “ [Cohen gets 3 years in jail for covering up Trump’s ‘dirty deeds’”.](https://www.msnbc.com/brian-williams/watch/cohen-gets-3-years-in-jail-for-covering-up-trump-s-dirty-deeds-1396687427929) Generally, story selection favors the Left; however, they are also occasionally criticized by left-leaning organizations. For example, according to [Fair.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/), MSNBC did not dedicate much airtime to the West Virginia Teachers Strike until the fair.org [article](https://fair.org/home/msnbcs-big-names-completely-ignore-west-virginia-teachers-strike/) was published. Further, [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/) published an [article](https://www.salon.com/2018/04/15/is-msnbc-going-conservative-supposedly-liberal-news-network-loves-nevertrumpers-more-than-leftists/) criticizing MSNBC for employing the “Republican Never Trump” type of conservatives.
According to the article, they are “Loading up on semi-repentant conservatives and ignoring the activist left, MSNBC is doing the nation a disservice.” In other words, MSNBC is so focused on negative coverage of Donald Trump that they are ignoring the progressive left and actually moving right. However, as a whole, according to
[Pew Research Center](http://www.journalism.org/2017/10/02/covering-president-trump-in-a-polarized-media-environment/pj_2017-10-02_trump-first-100-days_m-01/), MSNBC is favored by a liberal audience, which indicates content and story selection tends to lean left to appeal to their core viewers. Further, MSNBC frequently reports [negatively on progressive candidates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/bernie-sanders-criticizes-msnbc-over-coverage-of-his-campaign/2020/02/24/d81ff79e-5724-11ea-ab68-101ecfec2532_story.html). Lastly, [in a 2018 survey](https://kf-site-production.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/pdfs/000/000/255/original/KnightFoundation_AccuracyandBias_Report_FINAL.pdf) conducted by the [Knight Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/knight-foundation/)/ [Gallup,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gallup/) they found that the public rates MSNBC the 3rd most biased media source (left) behind [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) (right).
When reporting news, MSNBC mainly provides
[video clips](https://www.msnbc.com/stephanie-ruhle/watch/after-michael-cohen-sentencing-trump-tweets-he-never-directed-him-to-break-the-law-1396997187580) from reporters in the field. Text-based news comes directly from the Left-Center [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) website. When reporting straight news stories, MSNBC is highly factual and well-sourced. They use NBC News as their primary source; however, due to some of the guest political pundits spreading misinformation on their daily programs, we cannot rate MSNBC High for factual reporting on the whole.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/msnbc/) found that 48% of MSNBC’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 33% Mixed, and 18% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers MSNBC. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 46% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 35% do not, ranking them #5 in trust of the major USA news providers.
