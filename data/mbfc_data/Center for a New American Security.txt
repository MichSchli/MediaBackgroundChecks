In review, CNAS focuses on terrorism, the future of the US Military, and natural resource consumption. The website provides in-depth research such as this
[Defense Priorities](https://www.cnas.org/research/defense/defense-priorities-linking-strategy-to-budget). Their research is always well-sourced. The website also publishes related news stories from other sources with a slight leftward bias, such as this [Is It Wishful Thinking to Expect the U.S. to Return to the Paris Climate Deal?](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/is-it-wishful-thinking-to-expect-the-u-s-to-return-to-the-paris-climate-deal) These stories often link to credible outlets such as [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/) and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, when reporting on the former Trump Administration’s policies, they often report negatively, such as this:
[Why did the Pentagon ever give Trump the option of killing Soleimani?](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/why-did-the-pentagon-ever-give-trump-the-option-of-killing-soleimani) In general, they report factually with a left-leaning bias.
