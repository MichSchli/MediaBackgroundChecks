History
[Founded in 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/thelapost.com), The LA Post is a conservative news and opinion blog that does not report on the Los Angeles area. The website completely lacks transparency through a lack of an about page, disclosure of ownership, or the naming of authors. A search of social media turns up a Twitter handle [@thelapost](https://twitter.com/thelapost), which indicates Dr. Don Rose as the editor-in-chief.
Funded by / Ownership

Analysis / Bias
In review, The LA Post does not produce original content but rather summarizes and offers commentary that is conservative and pro-Trump. Headlines are often sensationalized and emotional such as this:
[BREAKING: A Federal Judge Just Put Obama on Notice](https://thelapost.com/2019/11/03/breaking-a-federal-judge-just-put-obama-on-notice/). This story is sourced to the factually mixed [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). The LA Post frequently promotes conspiracy theories from poor sources such as [Big League Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-league-politics/): [Putin Calls Out George Soros For Meddling In US Elections](https://thelapost.com/2019/11/03/putin-calls-out-george-soros-for-meddling-in-us-elections/). They also publish highly misleading headlines that do match the content or context of the story such as this: [Michelle Obama Says “There Are Too Many White People”.](https://thelapost.com/2019/10/19/michelle-obama-says-there-are-too-many-white-people/) Further, The LA Post [plagiarizes](https://www.bizpacreview.com/2019/10/02/chelsea-clinton-attacks-trump-on-the-view-his-whole-life-has-been-a-scam-833822) material from other low-quality sources such as [BizPac Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bizpac-review/). This article is copied and pasted, verbatim without attribution back to BizPac Review: [Chelsea Clinton attacks Trump on ‘The View’: ‘His whole life has been a scam’](https://thelapost.com/2019/10/09/chelsea-clinton-attacks-trump-on-the-view-his-whole-life-has-been-a-scam/).
