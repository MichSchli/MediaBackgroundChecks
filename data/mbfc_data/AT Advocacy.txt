Analysis / Bias
AT Advocacy provides tools and resources for others to create and manage their advocacy campaigns. However, the platform’s mission to connect social media influencers to progressive campaigns and causes indicates a left-leaning or progressive bias because it actively supports and promotes causes and campaigns typically associated with the political left or progressive ideologies.
For instance, the AT Advocacy website’s
[“Organizations”](https://atadvocacy.com/organizations) page features a testimonial stating that AT Advocacy assisted “Mothers Against [Greg Abbott](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/texas-governor-greg-abbott-political-bias-profile/)” in achieving viral success with an effective online strategy that translated into real-world support. AT Advocacy also has been involved in campaigns such as the one demanding the Justice Department investigate [Texas Governor Greg Abbott](https://atadvocacy.com/texas-trans) for his directive against parents of transgender kids receiving gender-affirming healthcare. This campaign, which advocates for the rights and protections of transgender individuals; these are clear examples of the platform’s progressive bias.
The website also publishes an email newsletter that utilizes highly emotional wording to frame former president Trump negatively, such as this
[TRUMP MAKES UNHINGED THREAT AGAINST JACK SMITH](https://atadvocacy-resources.com/trump-makes-unhinged-threat-against-jack-smith/) and [TRUMPER CHARGED IN BIG LIE VOTE TAMPERING SCHEME](https://atadvocacy-resources.com/gop-foe-dogs-desantis-over-slavery-stance/). In general, AT Advocacy holds strong left-leaning biases and lacks transparency.
