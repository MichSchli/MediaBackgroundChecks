History
In 2010, the
[Institute for Humane Studies](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/institute-for-humane-studies/) launched LearnLiberty.org, a website producing educational videos on libertarian ideas. The site’s stated goals are “to provide a starting point for conversations on important questions: What is the nature of man and society? What are the best ways to organize human society? What is the proper role of government?” According to their [about page](https://www.learnliberty.org/about/), “Learn Liberty is your resource for exploring the ideas of a free society. We tackle big questions about what makes society free or prosperous and how we can improve the world we live in.” The website is currently published by Students for Liberty.
Funded by / Ownership
Learn Liberty is published by
[Students for Liberty](https://studentsforliberty.org/north-america/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that advocates a libertarian perspective. Revenue is derived through donations to the Students for Liberty website.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Learn Liberty produces educational videos advocating a libertarian perspective. Videos often use moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Are Campuses Really More PC Today?](https://www.learnliberty.org/videos/are-campuses-really-more-pc-today/) This video is sourced from [Spiked Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/spiked-magazine/). The website also features a blog that hasn’t been updated since 2018.
Editorially, Learn Liberty promotes a classical liberal position such as
[free-market capitalism](https://www.learnliberty.org/blog/will-president-trump-kill-capitalism/), limited military intervention, and advocacy for the legalization of marijuana. Due to holding libertarian positions, they are often at odds with conservatives on social issues and progressives on economics. When it comes to science, they support the [consensus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on climate change. Generally, the news and information are factual and hold a right-center libertarian bias.
