Analysis / Bias
In review, The Conservative Central publishes news and opinion stories by Jose Andres. Usually, these stories present with extremely loaded emotional language, such as
[The Violent Left](https://theconservativecentral.com/the-violent-left/). This story is sourced from a Youtube video. Another story uses a sensationalized headline that denigrates Black Lives Matter [BLM Thugs Attack Jewish Supporters – A Few Questions](https://theconservativecentral.com/blm-thugs-attack-jewish-supporters-a-few-questions/). For the most part, original content links to a video with minimal text and promotes extreme right viewpoints.
The website also features news feeds from various right-leaning sources such as
[Reason](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/), [The Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) (Questionable), and [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/) (Questionable). In general, The Conservative Central publishes content that strongly favors the right and uses sources that have failed numerous fact checks.
