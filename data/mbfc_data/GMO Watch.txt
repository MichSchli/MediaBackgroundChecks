History
GMO Watch provides information on GMOs through publishing podcasts and blog posts. The website lacks transparency as they do not describe ownership or funding. According to the
[about page](https://gmowatch.com/), “GMO Watch is a place to get information from both sides of this debate. And I want that information to be easy to understand. While we’re at it . . . a sense of humor would be nice, too!” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
GMO Watch lacks transparency as they do not clearly disclose ownership; however, it appears that Emily Journey

Analysis / Bias
GMO Watch attempts to present both sides of the GMO debate. For example, the article
[“Are genetically modified foods safe to eat?”](https://gmowatch.com/are-genetically-modified-foods-safe-to-eat/) provides pro-GMO information from credible sources such as the [National Academy of Sciences](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-academy-of-sciences-nas/), [The American Medical Association](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-medical-association-ama/), and [ The American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-association-for-the-advancement-of-science-aaas/). They then present the anti-GMO position derived from sources we have labeled as either conspiracy or pseudoscience, such as the [Institute for Responsible Technology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/institute-for-responsible-technology/) and [GMwatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gmwatch/).
We also reviewed a Podcast titled
[Do GMOs cause cancer?](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/gmo-watch-1612057/episodes/do-gmos-cause-cancer-87026960) This podcast was pro-science as the Doctor being interviewed clearly stated there isn’t evidence that GMOs are harmful. He went on to describe how you can tell if the information is credible or not. Interestingly, his description of non-credible sources matches the pseudoscience sources GMO Watch references for anti-GMO positions.
In general, this source seems to have good intentions to present both sides; however, the anti-GMO side rejects the consensus of science on the safety of GMOs. By giving these organizations a voice, GMO Watch is contributing to the spread of
[anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and hence promoting pseudoscience.
