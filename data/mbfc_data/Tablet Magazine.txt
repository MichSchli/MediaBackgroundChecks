Analysis / Bias
In review, Tablet publishes news and analysis related to Jewish issues in the United States and worldwide. Most content is original and utilizes moderate loaded language, such as this
[The End of Citizenship](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/end-of-citizenship). In another story, they promote the right-wing conspiracy theory that Fact-Checkers are a “governmental regulatory agency” [Invasion of the Fact-Checkers](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/invasion-fact-checkers). This story, like most, uses credible sources such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) and [Columbia Journalism Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-journalism-review/).
Editorially, Tablet favors a pro-Israel conservative perspective such as this
[The Most Legitimate State on Earth](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-most-legitimate-state). Further, they promote Zionism in articles like [The Price of Being a Zionist Woman on Twitter](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/the-price-of-being-a-zionist-woman). When reporting on USA politics, they were never a fan of former President Trump; however, they frequently report negatively on President Joe Biden, [Biden Blames the Jews for His Ukraine Policy](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/biden-blames-jews-ukraine-policy) and [Don’t Believe Your Lying Eyes—or Joe Biden’s Big Mouth](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/hunter-biden-twitter-facebook). Finally, when covering Covid-19 matters, they hold strong right-leaning opinions, such as [How the CDC Abandoned Science.](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/science/articles/how-the-cdc-abandoned-science) In general, Tablet Magazine has a right-leaning editorial bias and is mostly factual in reporting.
