Analysis / Bias
In review, Dawn utilizes moderately loaded language in their headlines, such as
[‘Deep-rooted prejudice’: Pakistan condemns India’s restrictions on Eid rituals in occupied Kashmir](https://www.dawn.com/news/1636389/deep-rooted-prejudice-pakistan-condemns-indias-restrictions-on-eid-rituals-in-occupied-kashmir). Typically, Dawn sources through quotes but fails to provide links to their sources. In National politics, they are lightly critical of the current Khan government in their articles but must be careful in their criticism. Current Prime Minister Imran Khan is a member of the governing party, [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf), the Center-Right Islamic Populist Party.
Dawn also republishes articles from credible sources such as
[The Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [Los Angeles Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [AFP.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/)
Editorially, criticism of the government is rare as the military censors media outlets through denial of advertising revenue and intimidation; however, Dawn presents a more progressive perspective advocating for
[women’s rights](https://www.dawn.com/news/1635897/women-workers) and concern for climate change [Pakistan’s new climate change ministry merely “cosmetic.”](https://www.dawn.com/news/1161895/pakistans-new-climate-change-ministry-merely-cosmetic)
