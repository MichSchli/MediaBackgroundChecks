Analysis / Bias
The Bill of Rights Institute provides educational resources designed to be neutral and fact-based. For instance, they have a debate section where they publish debates such as
[“Should ChatGPT Be Banned from Classrooms?”](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/ttv/debates/should-chatgpt-be-banned-from-classrooms) which presents the topic and provides arguments for both sides. The “Current Standing” section also allows students to post their perspectives on the topic.
Further, The Bill of Rights Institute curates current
[news articles](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/current-events?_gl=1*1ld4bql*_ga*MjAzNzU4NTEzMC4xNjkxMzM0NTEy*_ga_12Q37C30Y9*MTY5MTMzOTkxOC4yLjAuMTY5MTMzOTkxOC42MC4wLjA.&_ga=2.66707943.834681634.1691334512-2037585130.1691334512) that connect with U.S. history, government, and civics classrooms. For instance, the article [ “Supreme Court rejects affirmative action, ending use of race as factor in college admissions](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/current-events/supreme-court-rejects-affirmative-action-ending-use-of-race-as-factor-in-college-admissions)” is not hosted on the Bill of Rights Institute’s website but rather from the [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) website. The story is about the Supreme Court’s decision to reject affirmative action in college admissions. They often curate from CBS News, [Seattle Times,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/seattle-times/) and [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), as well as some stories from [Oyez Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oyez-project/), such as [here.](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/e-lessons/obergefell-v-hodges)
The
[Bill of Rights Institute](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/) offers comprehensive curricula designed to provide educators with primary-source-based resources for U.S. history, civics, and government instruction. All of these resources are available free of charge. Notable offerings include [Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/curricula/documents-of-freedom), [American Portraits](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/curricula/american-portraits), profiles of influential American figures, and [Congress and the Constitution](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/curricula/congress-and-the-constitution), focusing on the legislative branch’s role. Finally, an example [lesson plan](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/lessons/slavery-and-the-struggle-for-abolition-from-the-colonial-period-to-the-civil-war) for grades 9 through 12 touches on African American History, Liberty, and Slavery. These resources give educators and students insights into the nation’s history and civic values.
While the content reviewed was fact-based, the Bill of Rights Institute has been criticized for “cherry-picking the Constitution, history, and current events to
[promote a libertarian](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-koch-brothers-sneak-i_b_6163946) message that the owners of private property should be free to manage their wealth as they see fit.” For example, under the [Documents of Freedom](https://bri-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/DoF+Activity+Book+FINAL+Version.pdf), they present the pro-business libertarian opinion that “When government officials can make any laws they please—and hold themselves above the law—there is less economic growth, less creativity, and less happiness.” In general, they hold a right-leaning libertarian bias.
