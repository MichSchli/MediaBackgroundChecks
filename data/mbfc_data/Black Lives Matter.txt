History
[Founded in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter), Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an international activist movement originating in the African-American community that campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. BLM regularly protests police killings of black people and broader issues of racial profiling, police brutality, and racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system. According to their [about page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/), “The Black Lives Matter Global Network is a chapter-based, member-led organization whose mission is to build local power and to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.”
The movement began after the death of Trayvon Martin and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, George Zimmerman. However, it was not until 1 year later, with the death of Michael Brown, that Black Lives Matter became
[organized](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-the-black-lives-matter-movement-changed-america-one-year-later/) and not just a hashtag.
BLM has faced criticism and negative perception that seems to
[vary based on race](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j64c02ub48aipja/PBS-NEWSHOUR-MARIST-POLL-SEP2015.pdf) and political affiliation. After the formation of Black Lives Matter, the phrase All Lives Matter appeared. The phrase [All Lives Matter](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/07/13/why-saying-all-lives-matter-opposite-black-lives-matter/87025190/) has been called racist and criticized for not understanding the message of BLM. Further, after the shooting of two police officers in Ferguson, the hashtag [Blue Lives Matter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/blue-lives-matter/) was created, a website with the same name. There have also been black civil rights leaders that [disagreed](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-black-lives-matter-20151030-story.html) with the tactics used by Black Lives Matter activists. Finally, some on the [very far right](https://www.mediamatters.org/sean-hannity/hate-group-nazis-fox-news-ramps-their-war-black-lives-matter?redirect_source=/research/2015/10/26/from-hate-group-to-nazis-fox-news-ramps-up-thei/206424) have characterized BLM as a [terrorist organization](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/08/09/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-terrorist-organisation), despite the FBI never using that classification.
