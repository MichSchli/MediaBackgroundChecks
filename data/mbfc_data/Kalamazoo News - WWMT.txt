Funded by / Ownership
WWMT is owned by
[Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sinclair-broadcast-group/), which is a publicly-traded American telecommunications company that is controlled by the family of company founder [Julian Sinclair Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Sinclair_Smith). The company is the largest television station operator in the United States by a number of stations, and largest by total coverage; owning or operating a total of 193 stations across the country (233 after all currently proposed sales are approved) in over 100 markets (covering 40% of American households), many of which are located in the South and Midwest.
Sinclair has been scrutinized by multiple media outlets for consistently favoring conservative politics. They are considered a
[rival to right biased Fox News](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/business/dealbook/sinclair-media-expansion-fox-conservative-media.html?_r=0) for the conservative audience. [The Seattle Times](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020756844_fishersinclairxml.html) has written a piece documenting Sinclair’s right-wing bias. Further, according to the [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), the Sinclair Broadcast Group has [donated](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000029062&cycle=2016) $1,143,508 or 80% to Republican candidates since 1994.
Finally, in March 2018, Sinclair ordered its stations to produce promos with an “anchor delivered journalistic responsibility message” dictated by the company.
[The wording of the mandated script](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html) was criticized by some station news staff and outside pundits for its discussion of “fake news,” with some critics arguing that the message used similar language and rhetoric to Donald Trump. [Trump responded](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/980799183425802240?lang=en) to the promos on April 2, 2018, defending the company as being “far superior to [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and even more Fake [NBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), which is a total joke.”
Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Kalamazoo News reports local news with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Vaccine supply nearly doubles for some West Michigan health departments, still not enough](https://wwmt.com/news/local/vaccine-supply-nearly-doubles-for-some-west-michigan-health-departments-still-not-enough). Videos from the TV station accompany many news stories. National and international news is provided through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and others by Sinclair properties.
Editorially, Wwmt.com does not publish op-eds; however, they tend to favor the right slightly when reporting on politics. Further, the website also features links to conservative TV host Sharyl Attkisson’s
[Full Measure](http://fullmeasure.news/) TV program as well as conservative [Eric Bolling](https://wwmt.com/news/local/vaccine-supply-nearly-doubles-for-some-west-michigan-health-departments-still-not-enough). In general, they report news factually and with a slight right-leaning editorial bias.
