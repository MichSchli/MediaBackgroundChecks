Analysis / Bias
TV Tropes is a comprehensive resource for various tropes in media and storytelling. It has a community of users called
[“Tropers.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/query.php?type=att) It does not focus on news or current events. Still, it does include tropes that can be political in nature.
For example, the trope
[“New Media Are Evil”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil) discusses societal skepticism toward new forms of media, which can have political implications. The page does not cite external sources, relying instead on community-contributed content. The wording in this particular trope does not show a clear political bias but rather presents a balanced view of how new media is often portrayed in various forms of storytelling. However, the lack of cited sources could raise questions about the factual accuracy of the content.
Another article is
[“Insane Troll Logic,”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic) which discusses a form of logic so irrational and nonsensical that it becomes impossible to argue against. The site maintains a neutral tone and does not appear to favor any political group. The article cites [rationalwiki.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rationalwiki/) but typically sources itself, as is common with most posts on TV Tropes as it generally relies on its content and community contributions rather than factual sources.
Finally, TV Tropes cover both
[Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and [Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), suggesting a balanced approach regarding the figures they profile. The site has separate pages for [Joe Biden](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden) and [Donald Trump](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump), each containing various tropes and examples related to these political figures.
In general, TV Tropes does not focus on news or current events but does include tropes that can have political or social implications. However, It’s difficult to determine the site’s political leanings as the content is largely generated by forum posts and user contributions, which can vary widely in perspective and bias. Due to the user-generated nature of the content, cited sources are not consistently observed in every post, making it challenging to assess the factuality of the content.
