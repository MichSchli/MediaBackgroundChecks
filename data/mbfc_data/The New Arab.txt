Analysis / Bias
The New Arab uses left-center bias when reporting USA news critical of former President Trump and often sources from credible mainstream media information. Articles and headlines often use loaded emotional wording that favors the left, especially regarding support for Palestine
[Israeli settlers storm Palestinian home in Hebron at night, harass family](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/israeli-settlers-storm-palestinian-home-hebron-night).
Editorially, they also hold a left-leaning bias with support for refugees from other countries such as this
[EU countries have a moral duty to help Afghan refugees](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/opinion/eu-countries-have-moral-duty-help-afghan-refugees). While based in the UK and owned by a Qatar company, they often promote pro-Qatar propaganda such as this [Qatari foreign minister says doing utmost to positively influence Taliban on women’s, minority rights](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/qatar-says-doing-utmost-positively-influence-taliban). In general, The New Arab is factual but often one-sided in the promotion of pro-Qatar propaganda.
