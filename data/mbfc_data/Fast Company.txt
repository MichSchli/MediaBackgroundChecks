Analysis / Bias
In review, Fast Company reports the news via interviews and original journalism focusing on Tech, Work-Life, and to a lesser extent, politics. Headlines and articles typically contain minimal to moderate loaded language:
[New Belgium Brewery’s employees think like owners. Because they are](https://www.fastcompany.com/90411668/new-belgium-brewerys-employees-think-like-owners-because-they-are). This story is correctly sourced from a Rutgers Institute Study. When it comes to reporting on politics, Fast Company often [reports negatively](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458978/hurricane-harvey-trump-cant-just-tweet-his-way-through-this-crisis) on the former Trump administration, such as this: [The fake video of Trump gunning down journalists isn’t the problem—Trump’s rhetoric is](https://www.fastcompany.com/90416953/the-fake-video-of-trump-gunning-down-journalists-isnt-the-problem-but-trumps-rhetoric-is).
While most stories favor left-leaning candidates, they also report somewhat critically on them:
[9 funny memes from the fourth Democratic debate to help you laugh and not cry](https://www.fastcompany.com/90418226/laughing-to-keep-from-crying-9-funny-memes-from-the-fourth-democratic-debate). From a political standpoint, Fast Company leans left with more favorable reporting on liberal issues and candidates.
