History
[Founded in 1996](https://patriotpost.us/about) as The Federalist, The Patriot Post is a Conservative media source promoting individual liberty. The founder was [Mark Alexander](https://patriotpost.us/about/mark-alexander), who is also the current editor.
According to their
[about page](https://patriotpost.us/about), the Mission is to be an “advocate of our Republic’s constitutional Rule of Law over the rule of men, the irrevocable terminus of the latter being tyranny. Our editors frame current social, political, and policy issues in the constitutional context established by our Founders and supported today by the plurality of Americans, who uphold the most basic tenet of our Republic: “that all men are created equal, that their Creator endows them with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Patriot Post publishes conservative news and commentary with moderately loaded wording that favors the right, such as this:
[Strong Economy Continues as Dems Warn of Collapse](https://patriotpost.us/articles/64703-strong-economy-continues-as-dems-warn-of-collapse). This story provides a [byline](https://patriotpost.us/contributors/475) to the author with biographical information. The article’s only external source leads to the factually mixed [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/). In another story, there is again only moderate loaded language that is appropriately linked to an author’s bio: [No, Ronald Reagan Was Not a Racist](https://patriotpost.us/articles/64701-no-ronald-reagan-was-not-a-racist?utm_campaign=debounce&utm_content=read_more&utm_medium=web&utm_source=patriotpost.us). Thiproperlypropriately sourced to the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
The homepage also features links to right-leaning opinion columnists such as Larry Elder, Ann Coulter,
[Ben Shapiro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ben-shapiro-bias-rating/), and [Dennis Prager.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/) Many opinion columnists do not have favorable track records with fact-checkers. In general, they properly source news, but sometimes from factually mixed sources. Further, all stories favor the right and paint liberals negatively. They also do not always support the [consensus of science](https://patriotpost.us/opinion/48675).
