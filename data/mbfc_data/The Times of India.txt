Analysis / Bias
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked India 142 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/india) which is borderline completely lacking press freedom.
In review,
[according](https://thewire.in/media/india-big-media-paid-news) to [The Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-wire-india/), “most newspapers in India would be completely unprofitable were it not for government advertising and other kinds of rent that they are able to collect. [Bloomberg ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/here-s-what-modi-spent-to-sell-the-india-story-around-the-world), “India’s government spent $640 million on advertisements.” Therefore, the media must be close to the ruling governments. Further, paid news, which is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_news_in_India) as an “organized practice in Indian newspapers and other media outlets, where news space and favorable coverage is exchanged for money,” is still [practiced. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44280188)
The Times of India publishes articles with emotionally loaded language and with a pro-Narendra Modi tone (Current Prime Minister and right-wing nationalist party
[BJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) leader) such as [“When presidents held umbrellas for Modi”](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-presidents-held-umbrellas-for-modi/articleshow/69796830.cms) and [“Making India $5 trillion economy challenging but achievable.” ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/making-india-5-trillion-economy-challenging-but-achievable-pm-modi/articleshow/69801618.cms)
When it comes to sourcing, they often hyperlink to themselves and other credible sources through
[quotes](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-military-lashes-bbc-for-false-reporting/articleshow/69670901.cms), such as the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/). When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump admin with a negative tone, such as in this article [“India suffers collateral damage in Trump’s trade war against China, Mexico.”](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-suffers-collateral-damage-in-trumps-trade-war-against-china-mexico/articleshow/69613312.cms)
In general, there is little press freedom in India; therefore, the papers, including the TOI, reports news in favor of the ruling party. In this case, the ruling party is right-leaning and hence the bias of the Times of India.
