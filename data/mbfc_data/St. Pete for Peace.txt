Analysis / Bias
In review, St. Pete for Peace primarily curates news from other sources with the message supporting a progressive left/libertarian bias. For example, they have a very negative view of Democratic President Joe Biden’s foreign policy, such as this
[Biden Foreign Policy Fact Sheet](https://www.stpete4peace.org/biden). This story consists of links to third-party sources highlighting Biden’s foreign policy. Some of the sources used are not credible such as [RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and [PressTV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/press-tv/). Other stories focus on Trump’s foreign policy, such as this [Trump Foreign Policy Fact Sheet](https://www.stpete4peace.org/trump). The primary message here is antiwar, which can identify with both the progressive left and libertarians. A review of content indicates more alignment with the left.
