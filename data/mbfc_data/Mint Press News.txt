Analysis / Bias
Mint Press presents news with a strong left-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines and articles use moderately loaded language like this:
[NFL Freezes Policy Barring Players From Kneeling During Anthem.](https://www.mintpressnews.com/national-anthem-policy/246172/) This particular story is republished from the conspiracy website [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). Typically, Mint Press sources their information, but sometimes it is from Mixed factual or conspiracy websites. In general, story selection moderately favors the left, such as this [Trump Administration Opens Door for Corporate Attack on Vulnerable Wildlife.](https://www.mintpressnews.com/endangered-species/246114/)
Mint Press News primarily focuses on stories about the middle east, Iran, Syria, and Israel. Most stories are negative when covering Israel, such as this
[CHRIS HEDGES: ISRAEL AND THE RISE OF JEWISH FASCISM](https://www.mintpressnews.com/chris-hedges-israel-rise-jewish-fascism/282961/). Further, they have frequently promoted conspiracy theories and misinformation regarding Covid-19, such as this [A DARPA-FUNDED IMPLANTABLE BIOCHIP TO DETECT COVID-19 COULD HIT MARKETS BY 2021.](https://www.mintpressnews.com/darpa-covid-19-vaccine-implant-mrna/271287/) The Covid vaccine [does not alter DNA](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/contrary-to-popular-claim-on-social-media-rna-vaccines-do-not-alter-our-dna/). They have also published conspiracy theories related to [9/11](https://www.mintpressnews.com/americans-questioning-official-september-11-new-wtc-7-evidence/261744/) and [Chemtrails](https://www.mintpressnews.com/no-longer-conspiracy-cia-admits-plans-aerosol-spraying-geoengineering/218179/). Finally, they frequently rely on Russian government sources like [RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) and [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/).
Politically, Mint Press News aligns with the far-left and frequently reports negatively on establishment Democrats like this
[WHO IS BIDEN WORKING FOR? ON ISRAEL VISIT, “ZIONIST” BIDEN WHITEWASHES ISRAEL’S CRIMES](https://www.mintpressnews.com/who-is-biden-working-for-on-israel-visit-zionist-biden-whitewashes-israels-crimes/281424/) and conservative such as this [EMBOLDENED BY TRUMP AND NETANYAHU, JEWISH SETTLER TERRORISM IS SPIKING](https://www.mintpressnews.com/emboldened-trump-netanyahu-jewish-settler-terrorism-spiking/275845/). Finally, [according](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-03-30/google-moonshot-redirect-far-right-online-extremism-anarchist) to the Rutgers University Network Contagion Research Institute, Mint Press “promotes anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.”
