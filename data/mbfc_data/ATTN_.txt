History
ATTN is a political and social site geared towards millennials, although not exclusively so. Founded in 2014 by Matthew Segal, a political activist, and commentator who writes for the
[Huffington Post](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/) and is also a frequent commentator on [MSNBC](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/). According to their [about page](https://www.attn.com/), they “create solutions-oriented narratives around the world’s biggest issues – sustainability, education, health, civic engagement, civil rights and more – to move social-first audiences to create positive change.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
While Mr. Segal’s politics are left-leaning, the content of ATTN is factual and well-sourced. The political tone of the articles is mixed, running from Left Bias to Least Biased. While this reflects the individual author’s opinions more than any specific editorial stance, this slight lack of focus on overall content prevented ATTN from receiving a Least Biased rating. Additionally, ATTN occasionally cites itself in its other articles, which I find a bit self-serving when any news site does it. Even if the content cited is factual. While again, this may reflect the individual author’s rather than editorial intent, it’s easy enough to use external sources instead. That said, the quality of the content on the site is very high, and except for a slight caveat on the bias and self-sourcing, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend ATTN to anyone looking for a solid news source.
