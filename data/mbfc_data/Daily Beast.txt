He states, “I want us to lean harder into who we are,” explaining further, “That means that if the Daily Beast is in the business of scoops — more scoops. “If we’re painting in bright colors now, I want to paint even brighter.”
In review, the Daily Beast tends to publish left-leaning stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded words such as
[“No, Rudy: Trump Isn’t Othello. He’s Iago”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/no-rudy-trump-isnt-othello-hes-iago?ref=wrap) and [“Imagine a Trump Who Could Constrain Himself and Just Talk About the Economy.”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/imagine-a-trump-who-could-constrain-himself-and-just-talk-about-the-economy?ref=wrap) However, they typically source the info in their reports using credible sources such as [Reuters,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and sources themselves.
