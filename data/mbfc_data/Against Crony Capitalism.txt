History
[Founded in 2010](http://whois.domaintools.com/againstcronycapitalism.org) by Nick Sorrentino and Hunter Lewis, Against Crony Capitalism (ACC) is a website that works to expose crony capitalism. “ [Crony capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism) is an economic system in which businesses thrive not as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the political class.” ie. Cronyism.
According to their
[about page](https://www.ac2news.com/about/), they state “We believe that special deals from the government for politically connected individuals, businesses, and powerful political interests destroy the marketplace. These favors, though often sold to the public as “regulations” or “works programs,” are usually vehicles for some to take from the many.”
Nick Sorrentino is the editor, and he also operates a personal website at
[TheSorrentino.com](http://TheSorrentino.com). [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Against Crony Capitalism exposes and reports on incidences of crony capitalism. Typically, ACC will quote an article and then link to the full article that takes the reader offsite. Headlines are usually not over-sensationalized:
[California Plans to Hike Tax on Legal Marijuana, Threatening New Market With Rapid Extinction](https://www.ac2news.com/2019/11/california-plans-to-hike-tax-on-legal-marijuana-threatening-new-market-with-rapid-extinction/). This story links to the [Legal Insurrection](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/legal-insurrection/) website, which we rate as Right Biased but High for factual reporting. In another story, [Wealthy Danes who want to make a deposit will need to pay up](https://www.ac2news.com/2019/11/wealthy-danes-who-want-to-make-a-deposit-will-need-to-pay-up/); they source the Least Biased [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). However, we have found instances of them using questionable sources such as [Summit News,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/summit-news/) [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), and the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/). Each of these sources has a poor track record with fact-checkers and has promoted debunked conspiracy theories in the past.
Editorially, ACC does not add much commentary to the stories they publish. However, story selection tends to favor pro-capitalism perspectives. For example, they fairly publish criticism of President Trump such as this:
[Trump to begin new round of trade-aid payouts to farmers](https://www.ac2news.com/2019/11/trump-to-begin-new-round-of-trade-aid-payouts-to-farmers/). Although ACC criticizes establishment Republicans, they frequently denigrate socialism and the left such as this: [That’s Socialism For Ya: Venezuelan Ex-Treasurer Admits He Took $1 Billion in Bribes](https://www.ac2news.com/2018/11/thats-socialism-for-ya-venezuelan-ex-treasurer-admits-he-took-1-billion-in-bribes/). This story contains biased commentary from the author but is appropriately sourced to the [Wall Street Journal.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) In general, Against Crony Capitalism reports news that appears mostly factual, despite the occasional use of poor sources.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years; however, they sometimes utilize sources that fail fact checks and promote conspiracy theories.
