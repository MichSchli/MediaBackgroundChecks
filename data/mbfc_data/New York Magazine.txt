[Milton Glaser](https://www.miltonglaser.com/milton/#0) and journalist [Clay Felker](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/clayfelker.html) founded New York Magazine, which Rupert Murdoch eventually acquired in 1976. In 2003, the Wall Street investment banker Bruce Wasserstein [acquired](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/18/business/why-did-he-buy-new-york-hey-wasserstein-loves-deals.html) New York Magazine for $55 million and brought Adam Moss in as its editor. NYM has earned many National Magazine Awards under his leadership. In 2009, after Bruce Wasserstein’s [death](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/22/bruce-wasserstein-obituary), his daughter Pamela Wasserstein became the company’s chief executive officer and ran it through a family trust. In January 2019, Pam Wasserstein announced that [David Haskell](http://nymag.com/press/2019/01/david-haskell-named-editor-in-chief-of-new-york-media.html) would succeed Adam Moss as editor-in-chief of the company; also, New York Media has named [Avi Zimak](http://nymag.com/press/2017/03/avi-zimak-joins-new-york-media-as-cro-and-publisher.html) as its new chief revenue officer and publisher.

Analysis / Bias
In review, New York Magazine publishes articles with emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Trump Likely to Accept Defeat on Wall Funding – and Claim He’ll Get His Money Elsewhere](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/trump-may-claim-hell-get-his-border-wall-money-elsewhere.html),” “ [The Green New Deal Is a Bad Idea, Not Just a Botched Rollout”](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/green-new-deal-aoc-bad-idea.html) and [“ AOC Thinks Concentrated Wealth Is Incompatible With Democracy. So Did Our Founders.”](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/01/ocasio-cortez-aocs-billionaires-taxes-hannity-american-democracy.html) NYM typically utilizes credible sources such as the [Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Marketwatch,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/marketwatch/) [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/).
Editorially, NYM does not publish many political op-eds; however, when they do, they almost always favor the left, such as this:
[Limbaugh Pretty Sure That The Late Show’s New Hire Means Civil War](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/04/limbaugh-colbert-hire-means-war.html). Further, NYM does not endorse political candidates.
