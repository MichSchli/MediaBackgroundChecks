Analysis / Bias
In review, Asharq Al-Awsat uses emotionally loaded headlines pertaining to US Politics such as this
[“Trump and a World Without Gary Cooper.”](https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1541436/amir-taheri/trump-and-world-without-gary-cooper) Further, most of the articles are Pro-Trump, such as these quotes from the article, which supports former President Trump’s international policy:
“Ardent advocates of global retreat by the United States feigned anger because Trump was doing what their darling Barack Obama dared not contemplate.”
“Trump-haters labeled it as another example of his supposed subservience to Vladimir Putin.”
In another piece that is Pro-Trump, written by the paper’s former editor-in-chief, the headline is emotionally loaded”
[“CNN, Qatar and the Targeting of Saudi Arabia.”](https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1664396/salman-al-dossary/cnn-qatar-and-targeting-saudi-arabia) This article praises Trump for calling [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) “the false news media.”
Regarding national politics, Asharq Al-Awsat is pro-Saudi government:
[“Jubeir: Nobody in Saudi Arabia Knew About Khashoggi’s Murder Except Those Who Did It.”](https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1587566/jubeir-nobody-saudi-arabia-knew-about-khashoggi%E2%80%99s-murder-except-those-who-did) This article, like most, does not provide hyperlinked sourcing of information but instead relies on quotations.
