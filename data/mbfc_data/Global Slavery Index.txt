[Global Slavery Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Slavery_Index) is an annual study of worldwide slavery conditions by country published by the [Walk Free Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_Free_Foundation) (founded by [Andrew Forrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Forrest)). In 2016, the study estimated a total of 45.8 million people to be in some form of modern slavery in 167 countries. According to their about page, “The 2018 Global Slavery Index provides a country-by-country ranking of the number of people in modern slavery, as well as an analysis of the actions governments are taking to respond, and the factors that make people vulnerable.” [Read our country profile on Australia.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/australia-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Global Slavery Index uses a published
[methodology](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423202435/http://d3mj66ag90b5fy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/GSI2014_full_methodology_new-op.pdf) to calculate slavery conditions by country. However, this methodology has faced [criticism.](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/232838/world-poll.aspx) The Global Slavery Index does not use loaded language and sticks to straight slavery information. Most of the website consists of charts and graphs that highlight slavery by country, which, quite frankly, is eye-opening. Despite the criticism of methodology, this source is creating an awareness that is rooted in mostly fact. They also publish news from other High factual sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Time.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/)
This source has not published new info since 2018, but still receives traffic for its 2018 data.
