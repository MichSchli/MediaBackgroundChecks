Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Camera publishes local news via journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Bear tranquilized near CU Boulder campus, relocated to mountains.](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/05/24/bear-tranquilized-near-cu-boulder-campus-relocated-to-mountains/) The national news is republished from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Political news coverage tends to lean left with stories like this: [Equal pay becomes Colorado law. Here’s what it means for companies](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/05/22/equal-pay-women-colorado-jared-polis/), and [Erie’s cancellation of Republican oil and gas meeting prompts outrage, calls for reversal from GOP leaders](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/05/17/eries-cancellation-of-republican-oil-and-gas-meeting-prompts-outrage-calls-for-reversal-from-gop-leaders/). Editorially, there is a mix of left and right-leaning opinions with a slight advantage to the right. The Daily Camera generally reports news with balance and is appropriately sourced.
