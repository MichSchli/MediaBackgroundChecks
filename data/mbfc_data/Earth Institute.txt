Analysis / Bias
In review, the Earth Institute does occasionally use
[loaded language](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/12/12/trumps-destruction-national-monuments-unethical-short-sighted/) to convey the message of sustainability, and they do not have a favorable view of President Trump. For example, in this article, they use loaded emotional language to describe President Trump’s position on science, such as this: [The Trump Administration’s Continued Attack on Science](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/08/15/trump-administrations-continued-attack-science/). Although left-leaning in bias, this story is very well sourced and factual.
From an editorial standpoint, the Earth Institute is very concerned with
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and supports the consensus that humans are influencing global warming: [10 Climate Change Impacts That Will Affect Us All](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2019/12/27/climate-change-impacts-everyone/). In general, the Earth Institute is factual and Pro-Science; however, they fall to the left based on their positions on climate change and potential solutions.
