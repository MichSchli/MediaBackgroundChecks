Post Carbon publishes critical articles on the former President, such as
[“Trump and His Many Billionaire Enablers.](https://www.postcarbon.org/trump-and-his-many-billionaire-enablers/)” The article uses strong, emotionally loaded language to denounce Trump and his supporters for policies benefiting the wealthy at the expense of people and the environment. A quote from the article reads,” Will there be any accountability for these most recent billionaire enablers of Donald Trump who saw what damage he caused–but still stood by him?”
The article
[“Competing Visions of Sustainability: Scarcity or Abundance?”](https://www.postcarbon.org/competing-visions-of-sustainability-scarcity-or-abundance/) discusses two competing visions of sustainability, scarcity and abundance. Post Carbon Institute advocates for sustainable, regenerative agriculture practices and argues that GMOs are not the answer to global food security. They sourced Sightline Institute, another [environmental think tank](https://www.sightline.org/about/staff/alanbio/), kingcounty.gov, EPA, [Wikipedia,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/) storyofstuff.org. and Upstreampolicy.org (link broken).
While there is no evidence of false information, the Post Carbon Institute sometimes relies on poor sources and does not always support the consensus of science.
