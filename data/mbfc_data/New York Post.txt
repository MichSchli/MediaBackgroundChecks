History
Founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton (One of the Founding Fathers of the United States), the New York Post (NY Post) is a daily tabloid newspaper from New York City. According to an article published by the
[NY Times,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) titled [“THE NEW YORK POST HAS A LONG HISTORY](https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/the-new-york-post-has-a-long-history-from-alexander-hamilton.html),” they describe how under Hamilton’s ownership, the paper-covered “shipping news, engaged in political crusades even if it meant the loss of advertising revenue.” Later owners were Poet William Cullen Bryant, who kept the NY Post for 50 years, followed by railroad magnate Henry Villard (1878), Oswald Garrison Villard (1917), Thomas W. Lamond, and Cyrus H. K. Curtis (1920). Under Curtis’ ownership, the NY Post followed a conservative editorial policy until 1936.
When David J.Stern acquired the paper in 1936, they became editorially more liberal. Dorothy Schiff bought the New York Post in 1939, which she controlled until 1976, and under her
[ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Upstairs-Dorothy-Schiff-York/dp/031231311X), The Post was liberal as it supported the civil rights movement and opposed the Vietnam War. In 1942, Theodore Thackrey became editor, and The Post switched from a broadsheet paper to a tabloid.
In 1976,
[Rupert Murdoch,](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/11673/index1.html) the owner of News Corp, acquired The New York Post, and in 1988, Murdoch sold the paper to Real estate developer [Peter S. Kalikow](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=4247001&privcapId=1241512). When Kalikow lost the paper to bankruptcy in 1993, Rupert Murdoch again purchased the paper and continues to own it today. Since Murdoch took over the paper, The Post has been known for its over-the-top [sensational headlines.](http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2013/04/18/shameless-paper-in-mindless-fog/) [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the New York Post tends to publish stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded wording such as “
[Cop cold-cocks unarmed man ‘acting irate’ at restaurant,”](https://nypost.com/2018/12/13/cop-cold-cocks-unarmed-man-acting-irate-at-restaurant/) and “ [It’s time for Bill Clinton to take a walk in the Chappaqua woods](https://nypost.com/2018/05/19/its-time-for-bill-clinton-to-take-a-walk-in-the-chappaqua-woods/).” The New York Post also republishes news from other sources, such as the least-biased [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). More stories favor the right, but the NY Post does not shy away from reporting [negative coverage of the right](https://nypost.com/2018/12/13/feds-launch-probe-into-trumps-inauguration-spending/) if it is a big story. They also tend to source their information properly; however, many times, the headline misleadingly exaggerates the actual story they are reporting.
Editorially, The Post has
[endorsed](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/) the Republican Presidential Candidate in every race since 1980. However, in 2016 they did not offer either candidate an endorsement for the Presidential election.
According to an
[LA Times article,](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-insight-haberman-20170728-story.html) the New York Post is reported to be former U.S. President [Donald ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)Trump’s preferred newspaper, which maintains frequent contact with Rupert Murdoch. The Post, According to a [survey](http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf) conducted by Pace University in 2004, was rated the least credible major news outlet in New York. The Post has been [criticized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post) since the beginning of Murdoch’s ownership for “sensationalism, blatant advocacy, and conservative bias.”
