Analysis / Bias
In review, Now The End Begins is a far-right Christian conspiracy website. Almost all stories on the website favor the right and usually falsely denigrate the left. Further, most stories are fake, such as this one:
[PROOF OF GEORGE SOROS NAZI PAST FINALLY COMES TO LIGHT WITH DISCOVERY OF FORGOTTEN INTERVIEW](https://www.nowtheendbegins.com/proof-george-soros-nazi-past-finally-comes-light-discovery-forgotten-interview/). The [reality](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/george-soros-nazi-jew-conspiracy-theory-roseanne-barr-twitter-rant-a8377301.html) is Soros was a 14-year-old Jew, hiding from the Nazi’s at that time. Virtually, every story on this website is either misleading or fake such as this: [ONE OF CONVICTED PEDOPHILE JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S SEX SLAVES SAYS SHE PERSONALLY SAW FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON ON ‘ORGY ISLAND’ WITH TWO YOUNG GIRLS](https://www.nowtheendbegins.com/convicted-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-sex-slaves-says-personally-saw-former-president-bill-clinton-on-orgy-island-with-two-young-girls/). This is an unproven claim. Further, Now The End Begins fails to mention [President Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/21/jeffrey-epstein-trump-clinton-1424120), which is confirmed. This is because Now the End Begins glorifies President Trump as a [savior](https://www.facebook.com/NowTheEndBegins/posts/10155839047241809?comment_id=10155844102276809&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D). In general, all stories favor the extreme right, with many anti-immigration stories as well as routinely [reporting negatively on Islam](https://www.nowtheendbegins.com/40-mind-blowing-quotes-barack-hussein-obama-islam-christianity/).
When it comes to science they chalk
