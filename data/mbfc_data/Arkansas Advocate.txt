Analysis / Bias
The Arkansas Advocate publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Arkansas. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects the people of Arkansas. Articles and headlines promote liberal perspectives through moderate, loaded language
[Little appetite for Manchin permitting bill in congressional lame-duck session](https://arkansasadvocate.com/2022/11/23/little-appetite-for-manchin-permitting-bill-in-congressional-lame-duck-session/).
They properly source, linking to credible sources such as
[whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), and bls.gov (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Editorially, opinion pieces favor the left, such as this
[Another mind-numbing mass murder brings reflection](https://arkansasadvocate.com/2022/11/23/another-mind-numbing-mass-murder-brings-reflection/). On the issues, the Arkansas Advocate promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change. Finally, they frequently report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [Trump to be subpoenaed by Jan. 6 panel as the ‘central cause’ of Capitol insurrection](https://arkansasadvocate.com/2022/10/13/trump-to-be-subpoenaed-by-jan-6-panel-as-the-central-cause-of-capitol-insurrection/).
