Analysis / Bias
Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of The United States. The BBC
[describes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-17139243) Puerto Rico as “Neither a state nor independent.” The head of government is the Governor, and The Chief of State is the President of the United States (Currently Democrat Joe Biden). Puerto Rico has two powerful political parties along with a few smaller parties. These are The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) (pro-Commonwealth/center left views similar to Democrats) and The New Progressive Party (PNP) (pro-statehood similar to Republicans ). On July 24, 2019, Governor Ricardo Rosselló (New Progressive Party) resigned due to the leaked [group chat scandal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico/top-puerto-rico-officials-resign-in-group-chat-scandal-that-ensnares-governor-idUSKCN1U9010) known as [chatgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegramgate).
According to an
[ipsnews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/inter-press-service-ips/) [article](http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/11/when-is-a-corporate-media-group-too-powerful/), El Nuevo Dia is a member of The Inter American Press Association (IAPA) with a quote from the article that reads “El Nuevo Día is a member of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), an organization that has frequently been accused of right-wing bias and political activism.” Further, [Luis A. Ferré,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_A._Ferr%C3%A9) who was the owner of El Nuevo Dia, was also the founder of the New Progressive Party.
In review, El Nuevo Dia publishes articles with minimally emotionally loaded language such as these:
[“Leaked chat between Puerto Rico’s governor and his executive team shakes the island”](https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/leakedchatbetweenpuertoricosgovernorandhisexecutiveteamshakestheisland-2505280/) and [“A cry for statehood.”](https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/acryforstatehood-2515336/)
Further, they also publish tabloid-style articles such as
[“Residents of a Dominican community catch a crocodile and sacrifice it.”](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/mundo/nota/residentesdeunacomunidaddominicanaatrapanauncocodriloylosacrifican-2518523/) When it comes to sourcing, often El Nuevo Dia hyperlinks to itself as well as to some domestic sources, which we do not know the credibility status, such as [sertelnoticias](http://sertelnoticias.com/2019/09/17/video-residentes-en-la-comunidad-de-neiba-se-comen-cocodrilo-encontrado-en-un-canal/) and [credible sources](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/eeuu/nota/uncarrochocacontraunatorreresidencialdetrumpennuevayork-2518506/) such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this article, [“Another rebuff to the island.”](https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/anotherrebufftotheisland-2513460/)
Editorially, more op-eds favor left-leaning positions such as these:
[Support for those displaced by climate change](https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/supportforthosedisplacedbyclimatechange-2518061/) [Reaffirming the defense of democratic values](https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/reaffirmingthedefenseofdemocraticvalues-2517927/) [Puerto Rico´s Recycling Law cannot be postponed](https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/puertorico%C2%B4srecyclinglawcannotbepostponed-2517779/)
