In review, KFSM – Fort Smith-Fayetteville News reports local news primarily through TV news videos and accompanying text. Local information is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[Crews respond to house fire in Springdale](https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/crews-respond-to-house-fire-in-springdale/527-95047e65-6a99-4079-9f67-7e232a1e3f92).
