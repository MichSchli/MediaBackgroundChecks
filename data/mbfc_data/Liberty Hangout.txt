History
Founded in 2015 by Kaitlin Bennett, Liberty Hangout is a self-described libertarian-leaning news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](http://libertyhangout.org/about-us/) “Liberty Hangout is a libertarian media outlet which strives to bring readers relevant insight into current events, as well as promote Austrian economics and property rights. We believe in self-rule, self-determination, and non-aggression. We believe taxation is theft and that the services the state provides can and should be privatized. We believe in decentralization down to the individual level, and that the government which is closest to home is easiest to control.” Bennett has also served as a [contributor](https://archive.is/Ot5bG) to the [Alex Jones](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lawsuit-alex-jones/infowars-founder-who-claimed-sandy-hook-shooting-was-a-hoax-ordered-to-pay-100000-idUSKBN1YZ1BB) conspiracy-peddling network [InfoWars.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) She also appears to loves guns and publishes [photos](https://twitter.com/KaitMarieox/status/995699996212322304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E995699996212322304&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenewpolitical.com%2F2018%2F09%2F24%2Fwho-is-kaitlin-bennett-the-kent-state-gun-girl-beyond-her-online-persona%2F) with her carrying weapons.

Analysis / Bias
In review, as of 2020, Liberty Hangout is not very active with only a few posts per year. It seems the focus of the blog is injustice directed toward Kaitlin Bennett who claims to serve as a conservative reporter. Most cases seem to involve her being assaulted by liberals such as this
[Bernie Sanders Campaign Assaults Female Conservative Reporter](http://libertyhangout.org/2019/06/bernie-sanders-campaign-assault-female-conservative-reporter/) and this [Liberal Student Calls Kaitlin Bennett’s Black Security Guards “Monkeys”](http://libertyhangout.org/2020/10/liberal-student-calls-kaitlin-bennetts-black-security-guards-monkeys/). Further, she has promoted [Holocaust Denial](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/02/21/liberty-hangout-holocaust-tweet/), [Anti-Transgender](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/01/16/kaitlin-bennett-far-right-gun-activist-transphobic-questions-students-liberty-hangout/), and generally hate-related opinions. In general, this is not a libertarian site, but rather a far-right conservative site, that an actual libertarian would denounce on principle.
