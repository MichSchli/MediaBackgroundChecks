Analysis / Bias
In review, Covert Geopolitics covers conspiracy theories and some pseudoscience such as for example on 3/22/17 a terrorist attack occurred in London. Without evidence, Covert Geopolitics proclaimed this a
[False Flag](https://geopolitics.co/2017/03/23/london-322-false-flag-attack-bores-to-death/) operation. In another case, they claim HAARP was used to create a [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://geopolitics.co/2016/03/03/indonesia-hit-with-7-8-magnitude-earthquake-recently/) in Indonesia as revenge for resisting Khazarian demands. What makes a good conspiracy is one that cannot be proven or disproven, but sounds like it could possibly happen. This source is filled with many that fit this description. In 2020, they reported negatively on President Trump such as this [Trump Pardons Blackwater Mercenaries, But Not Julian Assange](https://geopolitics.co/2020/12/23/trump-pardons-blackwater-mercenaries-but-not-julian-assange/).
In general, this is not a credible source that favors conspiracy theories but appears to lightly favor the left.
