Analysis / Bias
People Magazine primarily publishes general interest and celebrity news; however, the online section contains a politics section that we will review. Political news sometimes uses emotionally loaded language that favors the left, such as this:
[Trump Tried to Attack Biden Using a Nickelback Song, Then His Tweet Was Taken Down Over Copyright: ‘The Dumbest Timeline](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-video-nickelback-song-photograph-removed/).’ Other political stories are more serious and adequately sourced: [Planned Parenthood to Open Large Clinic Near States Where Abortion Access Is Threatened](https://people.com/health/planned-parenthood-to-open-large-clinic-near-states-where-abortion-access-is-threatened/). In general, the editorial direction of People is left-biased, with many stories negative toward conservatives and the former [Trump Administration](https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-praises-tweet-calling-greta-thunberg-actress/).
