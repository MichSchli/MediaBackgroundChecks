Analysis / Bias
Redoubt News (RN) is not so much a news source as a blog for the right-wing militia movement. Most notably, those groups that seek to use National Parks and Wildlife Preserves for their own purposes. The stories and opinion pieces on RN are written and worded to favor their point of view heavily, are primarily a rehash of the militia groups talking points, and offer little or no new facts. There are few links to credible sources, and what facts are presented are presented in a manner intended to favor the movement. Due to the lack of credible sources and the lack of objectivity, RN is rated as Conspiracy-Pseudoscience.
