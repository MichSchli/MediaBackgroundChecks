Analysis / Bias
Catholic World Report offers content from a right-leaning perspective, often utilizing emotionally loaded language; for example, the headlines consistently reflect a distinct Christian right perspective like
[“The Culture of Death is alive as Hell.”](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2022/07/15/207426/) The phrase “Culture of Death” typically refers to issues such as abortion, euthanasia, and embryonic stem cell research. The article uses strong negative descriptors for former Governor Kate Brown (D), referring to her as the “Petulant Poster Child for the Culture of Death,” labels the transgender movement as “trans-insanity,” and mockingly calls [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) “National Porn Radio,” indicating a clear editorial bias.
This type of language could potentially incite negative sentiments or hostility towards the mentioned groups. The author also mentions instances of church burnings in the aftermath of the Dobbs case but does not provide specific evidence to substantiate these claims, apart from a photo showing the phrase “My body, my choice” spray-painted on a wall at the Ascension Catholic School. The article cites sources such as
