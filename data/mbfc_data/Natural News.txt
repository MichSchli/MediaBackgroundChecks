Analysis / Bias
In review, Mike Adams is known as the
[Health Ranger](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/NaturalNews), according to [Rationalwiki](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rationalwiki/). However, they point out dozens of cases where his claims are false. Besides promoting pseudoscience, Natural News is an extreme right-wing biased source that frequently promotes Donald Trump’s propaganda such as these: [President Trump has a constitutional MANDATE to use the military to protect our southern border – Richard Sacks.](https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-01-18-president-trump-has-a-constitutional-mandate-to-use-the-military-to-protect-our-southern-border.html) This article is sourced from Natural News and Brighteon News, which we have never heard of. In this conspiracy story, there is zero evidence, and hence why it is a conspiracy: [CONFIRMED: Barack Obama was running the entire spygate operation that violated federal law to spy on Trump.campaign officials](https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-06-01-confirmed-barack-obama-was-running-the-entire-spygate-operation.html).
In general, politically, all stories favor the right and promote pseudoscience such as
[chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), the Sandy Hook shooting being a false flag: [Sandy Hook: mind-control flicker effect.](https://www.naturalnews.com/038409_Sandy_Hook_mainstream_media_mind_control.html) Lastly, this source denies the consensus on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) without evidence, as seen here: [Climate change cultists are now taking over your local weather forecast.](https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-05-09-climate-change-cultists-are-now-taking-over-your-local-weather-forecast.html)
