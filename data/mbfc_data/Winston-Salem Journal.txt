A review of the [editorial page](https://www.journalnow.com/opinion/editorials/) shows a left-leaning bias in story selection. Further, the newspaper has endorsed Republican candidates in the past, but in 2012 it endorsed Barack Obama, and in 2016 they endorsed Libertarian Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson.
The Winston-Salem Journal generally reports news with minimal bias but editorially presents a slight left-leaning bias.
