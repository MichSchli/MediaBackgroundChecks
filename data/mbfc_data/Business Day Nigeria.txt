Analysis / Bias
The headlines and articles often focus on economic issues and governance. For example, articles like
[“How corporate governance gaps made Emefiele’ emperor'”](https://businessday.ng/news/article/how-corporate-governance-gaps-made-emefiele-emperor/) and [“Emefiele’s Naira-4-Dollar, initiative for exporters gulp N155bn”](https://businessday.ng/news/article/emefieles-naira-4-dollar-initiative-for-exporters-gulp-n155bn/) discuss governance and economic policies. Another article, [“Blue Line Rail begins commercial operations, Sanwo-Olu boards first train,”](https://businessday.ng/news/article/blue-line-rail-begins-commercial-operations-sanwo-olu-boards-first-train/) discusses infrastructure development.
The tone of the articles is neutral to slightly center-right, focusing on economic growth and governance. However, most articles have broken links, raising questions about the website’s credibility.
Failed Fact Checks
Overall, BusinessDay Nigeria is a moderately popular online newspaper with a right-center bias. While it generally provides articles on business and economic issues, the lack of transparency in ownership and the significant presence of broken links in most articles raises questions about the site’s reliability and credibility, leading to a mixed factual reporting rating.
