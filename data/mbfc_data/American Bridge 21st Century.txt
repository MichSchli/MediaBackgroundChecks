Analysis / Bias
In review, the primary objective of American Bridge is to perform opposition research. This is done by having
[“trackers”](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/psst-gop-american-bridge-is-watching-094831) follow and record Republican candidates across the country. These trackers employ high-tech recording gear in the hope of capturing Republicans in embarrassing moments.
The website also reports news with moderately loaded language such as this:
