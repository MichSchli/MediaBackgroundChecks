Analysis / Bias
In review, Get Holistic Health is a quackery-level pseudoscience website that routinely publishes false and/or dangerous medical claims. For example, they frequently promote
[miracle cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) such as these: [The guy who cured stage IV prostate cancer with baking soda and molasses](https://www.getholistichealth.com/79274/guy-cured-cancer-baking-soda/) [A healer from Austria cured 45 000 people of cancer with 42 days juice recipe](https://www.getholistichealth.com/79200/healer-austria-cured-people-cancer/) [‘Every type of cancer can be cured in weeks’, according to this doctor](https://www.getholistichealth.com/78166/every-type-cancer-cured-weeks/)
When not promoting miracle cancer cures, they publish misleading
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as these:
[Measles Outbreaks have nothing to Do with Non-Vaccination trends](https://www.getholistichealth.com/77941/measles-outbreaks-non-vaccination-trends/) [Why the Amish people don’t get autism, cancer, and heart disease](https://www.getholistichealth.com/78387/amish-people-autism-cancer-heart-disease/) [Lead vaccine developer of Gardasil comes clean and says ‘adverse side effects much greater than the risk of cervical cancer.’](https://www.getholistichealth.com/78330/lead-vaccine-developer-gardasil-comes-clean/)
This source is also
[anti-GMO](https://www.getholistichealth.com/78926/beer-toxic-gmo-ingredients/) and [promotes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) quack diets that promise impossible results.
