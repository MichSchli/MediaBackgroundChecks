Analysis / Bias
In review, Macleans covers social issues, politics, and Canadian news through the use of journalists. News stories typically use minimal loaded words:
[What a trade war with China would do to Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-a-trade-war-with-china-would-do-to-canada/). This story is correctly sourced to the [Globe and Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-globe-and-mail/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). When covering political issues, Macleans provides a reasonable balance: [Ottawa and provinces pause carbon tax fight to battle plastic](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/ottawa-and-provinces-pause-carbon-tax-fight-to-battle-plastic/).
Editorially, they also tend to give both sides, however many more favor the left:
[The bankruptcy of the Conservative Party.](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-bankruptcy-of-the-conservative-party/) Further, many opinion pieces center around [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and the action they feel needs to occur: [Trudeau should try walking the walk on climate change](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/trudeau-should-try-walking-the-walk-on-climate-change/). In general, news reporting is factual and with minimal bias; however, editorials lean left.
