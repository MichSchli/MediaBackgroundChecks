History
[Founded in 2015](https://whois.domaintools.com/now8news.com), Now8News is an imposter website that attempts to mimic a real news website. There is a complete lack of transparency in ownership, however their [about page](http://now8news.com/about/) states “Now8News.com is on the look for top stories in your area and across the world.”
Funded by / Ownership
Now8News does not disclose ownership and revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Now8News clearly publishes fake news that may or may not be satire as they do not offer a disclaimer. For example, this story
[Man Cuts Off Thumbs Claiming They Were Causing Him To Type Homophobic Tweets](http://now8news.com/man-cuts-off-thumbs-claiming-they-were-causing-him-to-type-homophobic-tweets/), is clearly not true, but is it satire? We don’t know because the website does not reveal that. Other fake news stories are aimed at President Trump such as this [Frito-Lay Changes Color Of Cheetos To Avoid Association With Trump](http://now8news.com/frito-lay-changes-color-of-cheetos-to-avoid-association-with-trump/). In general, this may or may not be a satire website, but it clearly is an imposter site with a domain leading one to believe it is a news network. It certainly is not!
