Analysis / Bias
In review, PatriotRetort is an opinion blog with a right-wing bias in reporting. Headlines and articles frequently contain loaded language that favors the right, such as this:
[Operation Smear Kavanaugh is blowing up](http://patriotretort.com/operation-smear-kavanaugh-is-blowing-up/). When it comes to proper sourcing of information, there really isn’t any unless you consider tweets and Youtube links as proper sourcing. We don’t. With that said, this is an opinion blog that also disclaims that some of their posts are satire. Essentially, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left.
