Analysis / Bias
In review, Bild typically publishes short articles with very large font sizes and big colorful pictures. Up until 2012, Bild had a
[tradition](https://www.yahoo.com/news/german-tabloid-bild-abolish-front-page-pics-nude-133012568.html) of publishing photos of naked women on its front page. Bild often publishes sensational stories such as [“Penis sheaths to be banned in Papua police crackdown?”](https://www.bild.de/news/bild-english/papua-new-guinea-penis-sheaths-could-be-banned-6981708.bild.html) Further, they frequently use emotionally loaded language like [Merkel in Berlin Supermarket: The Chancellor pays with a card](https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/politik-inland/merkel-in-berliner-supermarkt-die-kanzlerin-zahlt-mit-karte-69537342.bild.html) and “ [Is Germany now threatened by a corona pegida?](https://www.bild.de/politik/inland/politik-inland/demonstrationen-in-ganz-deutschland-muessen-wir-angst-vor-einer-corona-pegida-ha-70587732.bild.html)” (Note: [Pegida](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-pegida-and-critics-hold-opposing-dresden-rallies/a-50906895) is a far-right nationalistic political movement). On the issues such as immigration, they report the news with strong emotionally loaded headlines such as “ [The secret report warns of more and more migration](https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/politik/inland/politik-inland/bild-exklusiv-geheimbericht-warnt-vor-immer-mehr-migration-67521846,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html).” However, they also publish articles regarding immigrants with a positive tone, such as [“We Help.”](https://www.bild.de/news/inland/fluechtlingshilfe/bild-aktion-wir-helfen-refugees-welcome-42387340.bild.html). [Critiques](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-08/how-germany-s-right-wing-tabloid-learned-to-love-refugees) of Bild’s approach claim they are “an unstable person’s mood swings that shifts day to day such as one day, Bild publishes articles against ‘refugee hate’ and the next day they publish articles with headlines such as ‘568 Asylum Seekers Are Multiple Offenders!’ fueling fear and hate.”
Bild uses quotes from experts and hyperlinks sources such as
[Telegraaf.nl](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/de-telegraaf/), [People Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/people-magazine/), and [The Sun when it comes to sourcing.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-sun/) When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this article, [“Someone was stupid!”](https://www.bild.de/politik/trump/politik-ausland/usa-donald-trump-laestert-wegen-coronavirus-ueber-china-70520418.bild.html)
