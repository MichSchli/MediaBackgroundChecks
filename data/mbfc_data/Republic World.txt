Analysis / Bias
In review, Republic World reports international news from mostly mainstream sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). They also publish stories with a left-wing bias that uses loaded headlines, such as this one that belittles President Trump and his claims of fake news: “ [Donald Trump Is The Undisputed Heavyweight President Of The World!](http://www.republicworld.com/s/2370/donald-trump-is-the-undisputed-heavyweight-president-of-the-world)” Further, they often source poorly as they do not provide links for their articles. When reporting India national news, they are pro-right Government due to their affiliation with political parties. In general, stories pertaining to India are highly biased toward the right-leaning Government.
