Analysis / Bias
In review, Al-Masdar News
[publishes world news](https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/trump-continues-self-destructive-u-s-policy-syria/) stories from credible sources such as [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/); however, Middle East news is poorly sourced, without links provided. Through a search, we found that [one of the stories ](https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-israeli-warplanes-bomb-lebanese-syrian-border/)came from the Questionable propaganda source, [The Duran](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-duran/). Further, [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), [The Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/), and the New York Times all [described Al-Masdar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masdar_News) as a “pro-government website.”
Al-Masdar says on their
[about page](https://www.almasdarnews.com/about/) that they are an independent media service free from any political or corporate funding, sponsorship, or association. Still, western media refers to them as “Pro-Regime.” Finally, they have also been described as a source for [Russian Disinformation](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/russian-trolls-putin-trump-twitter-hamilton/) regarding Syria in which they always favor the Government. In general, they publish pro-Syrian Government propaganda.
