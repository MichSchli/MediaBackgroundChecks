Analysis / Bias
In review, EURACTIV publishes articles in collaboration with credible newsagents such as
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) with minimal emotionally loaded language such as [“Virus puts brakes on Salvini’s far-right message in Italy.”](https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/virus-puts-brakes-on-salvinis-far-right-message-in-italy/) They also cover national politics; for example, here is an interview with German Politician [“Linn Selle: Coronavirus may have a long impact on German presidency.”](https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/interview/linn-selle-coronavirus-may-have-a-long-impact-on-german-presidency/)
When it comes to sourcing, international coverage utilizes both news agency material as well as foreign correspondents. EurActiv has
[partnerships](https://www.euractiv.com/about-euractiv/media-partners-network/) with media outlets such as “Poland’s [Gazeta Wyborcza](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gazeta-wyborcza-bias/) (Conservative-leaning), Italy’s Class Editori (Italia Oggi, Milano Finanza), Germany’s Der Tagesspiegel and Wirtschaftswoche, France’s La Tribune and Ouest-France (Center-Right) and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) (Center-Left) in the UK.”
In covering the USA, they typically collaborate with AFP and
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). In general, EURACTIV reports news factually and with a slight left-leaning editorial bias as they report from multiple angles and use a wide variety of left-leaning and right-leaning sources.
