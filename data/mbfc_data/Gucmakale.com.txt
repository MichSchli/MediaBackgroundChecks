Analysis / Bias
In review, Gucmakale is a mirror website of Femalista.com that breaks news down into categories such as Women, Activism, Beauty & Health, Body & Love, LGBT, Parenting, and Politics. Story selection favors a liberal perspective and utilizes moderately loaded emotional wording such as this
[Ex-Homophobes Share What Was The Eye-Opener That Changed Their Minds](https://www.gucmakale.com/wp/ex-homophobes-share-what-was-the-eye-opener-that-changed-their-minds/). This story, like most, is published by the anonymous Vicky and is sourced to Social Media. A review of several articles indicates they do not source information properly.
