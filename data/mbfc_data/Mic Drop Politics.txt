The website lacks transparency as the [about page](https://www.micdroppolitics.com/about-us/) presents Latin dummy text, while owners, editors, and authors are not disclosed. A [mailing address](https://www.micdroppolitics.com/contact-us/) in California is the only indication the site might be from the USA.

Analysis / Bias
Mic Drop Politics does not conduct original reporting; instead, they summarize news articles or directly plagiarize them without giving credit. The website publishes sports stories, international, health, and politics from sometimes credible sources such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and Questionable sources such as [Just The News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Editorially, political-related stories favor the right and often promote misinformation regarding Covid-19. For example, they republished an article from the Gateway Pundit titled
[UK HEALTH SECURITY AGENCY RELEASES DATA SHOWS MOST COVID-19 DEATHS IN ENGLAND ARE FULLY VACCINATED](https://www.micdroppolitics.com/articles/uk-health-security-agency-releases-data-shows-deaths-england-fully-vaccinated/). This story is rated [false](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/oct/19/facebook-posts/claim-covid-19-uk-ignores-data-showing-death-more-/) by [PolitiFact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/). In another story sourced from the Questionable [100% Fed Up](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/100-percent-fed-up/), they demonstrate far-right bias in wording with this “After China Mitch McConnell came out yesterday with his back-stabbing, communist-loving, freedom-hating submission to his Chinese masters, many people wonder just what a contingency election would look like in Congress, thanks to real conservatives sending dueling electors to Capitol Hill.” In general, they routinely publish misinformation with a far-right editorial bias.
