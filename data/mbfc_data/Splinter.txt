Analysis / Bias
In review, Splinter News
[curates](http://fmg.kinja.com/fusion-media-group-to-launch-splinter-1796716100) stories from mostly left leaning sources that include: [Jezebel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jezebel/), [The Root](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-root/), [Gizmodo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gizmodo/), [Deadspin](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/deadspin/), Jalopnik, [Kotaku](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kotaku/), and [Lifehacker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lifehacker/). Splinter News uses loaded words in their headlines and [articles](https://splinternews.com/that-time-a-powerful-senator-called-the-white-house-a-d-1819261029) such as “That Time a Powerful Senator Called the White House a Day–Care Center.” They tend to source their articles well, however they sometimes source to blogs such as slowlyboiledfrog.com. Splinter also publishes stories with sensational headlines such as “After Being Kicked Out of a Christian School, Trans Teen Becomes a Homecoming King.” In general, all stories favor the left.
