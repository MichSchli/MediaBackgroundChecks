History
Founded in 2017, American Oversight is a watchdog organization that uses litigation to access documents under FOIA (The Freedom of Information Act) protections. According to their
[about page](https://www.americanoversight.org/about), they are an “ethics watchdog and is the top Freedom of Information Act litigator investigating the Trump administration.” American Oversight [targets](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/13/new-legal-watchdog-seeks-trump-administration-records-sunshine-week/99034426/) federal agencies such as Housing and Urban Development and Education departments.
Austin Evers (Former Senior Counsel under the Obama Administration) is the Executive Director and founder of American Oversight, and the senior adviser is Melanie Sloan (a former Democratic Congressional aide and founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). The website

Analysis / Bias
American Oversight consists of the following sections: Investigation, States, Documents, and News. In April 2018, they introduced its
[Parallel Investigations Initiative](https://www.americanoversight.org/investigation/parallel-investigations-initiative-amplifying-congressional-oversight-3), and under the Documents section, you can [filter](https://www.americanoversight.org/documents) through the numerous FOIA requests they file. On most days, they file multiple requests such as this: [FOIA to DOI seeking records relating to mining leases held by a subsidiary of a company owned by Ivanka and Jared Kushner’s Washington, DC landlord.](https://www.americanoversight.org/document/foia-to-doi-seeking-records-relating-to-twin-metalss-mining-leases)
In review, American Oversight uses emotionally loaded language in its headlines, such as
[“Sessions Letter Shows DOJ Acted On Trump’s Authoritarian Demand to Investigate Clinton”](https://www.americanoversight.org/sessions-letter) and [“News Roundup: Trump Administration’s Defiance of Congressional Subpoenas.”](https://www.americanoversight.org/news-roundup-trump-administrations-defiance-of-congressional-subpoenas) American Oversight utilizes credible sources such as KFGO (radio station serving the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area), [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), [The Hill,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Politico.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/)
In general, American Oversight’s sole purpose is to keep the former Trump Administration and its supporters accountable through document requests and lawsuits. In many ways, they are the left-leaning equivalent of
[Judicial Watch](https://www.americanoversight.org/american-oversight-in-the-news-countdown-to-oversight), minus the numerous failed fact checks.
