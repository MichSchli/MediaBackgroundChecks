History
[Founded in 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/usaisonline.com), USA is Online is a hyper-partisan news and opinion blog. There is zero transparency as they do not have an about page, list a location, and do not list authors or name owners.
Funded by / Ownership
USA is Online claims to be copyrighted to The Daily Post, Inc., which seems impossible. Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, USA is Online publishes news and opinions with a far right bias and frequently uses loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Team Trump Turns Tables On Dems, Accuses Them Of ‘Massive’ Crime](https://usaisonline.com/team-trump-turns-tales-on-dems-accuses-them-of-massive-crime/). Many stories are directly copy and pasted from others sources without citation (plagiarized) such as this from [The Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/): [BREAKING, Leaked Documents Show Tens Of Millions From Ukraine Paid To Kerry, Biden Jr Fund, Report](https://usaisonline.com/breaking-leaked-documents-show-tens-of-millions-from-ukraine-paid-to-kerry-biden-jr-fund-report-2/). In general, all stories on the website favor the right and in particular President Donald Trump.
