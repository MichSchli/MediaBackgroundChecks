Funded by / Ownership
Turning Point Action publishes students for Trump, a 501(c)(4) organization whose core mission is to identify, educate, and organize on principles of limited government, free markets, and fiscal responsibility. Revenue is derived through donations. There is a lack of transparency as they do not indicate large donors.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Students for Trump is a conservative advocacy organization that endorses candidates. They indicate that they have partnerships with PACS/organizations
[Freedom Works](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-works/), [America First Policies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/america-first-action-superpac/), Heritage Action for America, and Young Americans for Liberty. The website does not publish news, but they have a [petition](https://trumpstudents.org/petitionagainstwhitmer) against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer due to her handling of Covid-19 restrictions. However, they do not publish news on this website. The organization does promote false and misleading information via its social media accounts, as evidenced below.
