Analysis / Bias
In review, Freedom News Report is an opinion-based news reporting blog. There is significant use of biased loaded words in headlines such as this:
[Obama’s Elitists Comrades on the Run.](https://freedomnewsreport.com/2018/12/05/obamas-elitists-comrades-on-the-run/) Like every single article on the website, this article does not have an author name or any sourcing at all. It appears to simply be opinions rendered without evidence.
Generally, all stories on this website favor the right and denigrate the left. While some of the reporting may be true, without an author name or sourcing of any kind, it simply is not credible. With this update in 2022, we find they have not published new content since 2021. We leave this source open as their stories are still online.
