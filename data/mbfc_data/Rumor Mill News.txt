Analysis / Bias
The website links to Rumor Mill News radio and a forum where subscribers publish news stories. Most news stories are far-right conspiracy and pseudoscience related. For example, this story comes from the satire website
[Real Raw News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-raw-news/), which frequently dupes conservatives with fake news stories: [Putin Decimates Another Adrenochrome Warehouse in Ukraine](https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=217520). This QAnon conspiracy theory has been [debunked](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/feb/16/blog-posting/vladimir-putin-didnt-intercept-shipment-of-chemica/) by fact-checkers. In this story, they report on chemtrails: [Chemtrails Go Viral In Wake Of Toxic Ohio Train Derailment](https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=217491). This story is sourced back to the Very Low factual [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/).
In another fake news story, they claim:
[Kayleigh McEnany’s Father is JFK Jr.](https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=217504) [This is not true](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/20/viral-image/no-kayleigh-mcenany-isnt-jfk-jrs-daughter/). Regarding sourcing, they rely on other questionable, conspiracy, and pseudoscience sources like [X22 Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/x22-report/), [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/), and [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). Finally, most members publish news that is favorable to the right, such as this [As The Economy Implodes, Credit Card Balances Are Increasing At The Fastest Pace In U.S. History](https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=217478). In general, Rumor Mill News publishes far-right conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. While some posts are fact-based, the majority are not.
