According to the [about page](https://puck.news/the-story-of-puck/), they are a “new media company focused on the intersection of Wall Street, Washington, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood: that rarified and overlapping world filled with moguls and strivers, powerbrokers and disruptors, behind-the-scenes players and ubiquitous C.E.O.s, alike.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Puck.News produces long and short-form journalism covering economics, technology, entertainment, and politics. Articles and headlines contain emotionally loaded language, such as this
[CNN+’s Chronicle of a Death Foretold](https://puck.news/cnns-chronicle-of-a-death-foretold/). While this story references other sources, it fails to provide hyperlinks to the information. The site relies on credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/).
Editorially, more stories favor the left, such as how
[ the Trump-McCarthy Romance Ends](https://puck.news/how-the-trump-mccarthy-romance-ends/) and [The Trump-Oz-“Dave” Love Triangle Takes a Dark Turn](https://puck.news/the-trump-oz-dave-love-triangle-takes-a-dark-turn/). A quote from [another article](https://puck.news/the-right-stuff-ozs-agony-how-elon-ripped-trump-shapironomics/) frames a conservative candidate in a negative light “In recent months, he resigned from Bridgewater, moved back to the Pittsburgh burbs, slapped on a barn jacket, began tweeting Bible verses, and (presumably juiced by his wife’s old White House contacts) engaged a slew of former Trump staffers—Hope Hicks, Stephen Miller and Cliff Sims among them—to whip up some deplorable enthusiasm around his candidacy.” In general, news reporting is mostly factual and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
