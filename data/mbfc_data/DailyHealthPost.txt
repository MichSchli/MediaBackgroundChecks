History
[Founded in 2012](http://whois.domaintools.com/dailyhealthpost.com), DailyHealthPost is a website that publishes natural health information, which is often false or misleading. According to their [about page](https://dailyhealthpost.com/about/), they state “We cover a broad range of topics under the umbrella of natural health, which includes nutrition, wellness, yoga, holistic medicine, inner peace, prevention, and much more.”
DailyHealthPost completely lacks transparency by not naming authors, editors, or ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, DailyHealthPost publishes natural health news that often promotes pseudo-scientific quackery. For example, they have made
[numerous natural cancer cure claims](https://dailyhealthpost.com/search/?q=cancer+cure). The following is a short list: [Carrot Juice Cures Stage 4 Cancer](https://dailyhealthpost.com/carrot-juice-cures-stage-4-cancer/) [Man With “Terminal” Lung Cancer Cures Himself With Cannabis Oil](https://dailyhealthpost.com/cannabis-oil-lung-cancer/) [Not Even Cancer Can Stand Up To This Combination of Honey And Baking Soda](https://dailyhealthpost.com/honey-and-baking-soda-cancer-remedy/)
While all of these natural products may have some small value to health,
[there isn’t any scientific evidence that they cure cancer.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/)
DailyHealthPost also promotes quackery products such as
[detoxing foot pads](https://dailyhealthpost.com/how-to-make-deotx-foot-pads-at-home/) that they allege [draw toxins from the body](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-detoxification/). However, the [medical community reports](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/detox-foot-pads/faq-20057807) there isn’t evidence to support this. Further, they also make [false claims](https://dailyhealthpost.com/cancer-causing-foods-to-avoid/) about refined sugar being a cause of cancer, which is not supported through [direct evidence](https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2017/05/15/sugar-and-cancer-what-you-need-to-know/). Excessive sugar intake may lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for cancer, but cancer is not a direct result of sugar. Finally, they also report conspiracy theories such as this: [50 Holistic Doctors Have Mysteriously Died In The Last Year But What’s Being Done About it](https://dailyhealthpost.com/holistic-doctors-dead/)? In general, they do not hold a particular political bias.
