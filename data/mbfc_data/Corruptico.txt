Analysis / Bias
Corruptico consistently promotes anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. For example, The article titled
[ “Jewish Detection: How to Identify a Jew”](https://www.corruptico.com/2016/08/31/jewish-detection-how-to-identify-a-jew/) provides a guide on visually identifying Jewish individuals based on certain facial features and characteristics. The article exhibits a clear bias, promoting harmful stereotypes; it lacks any empirical basis, is rooted in prejudice, and encourages readers to make judgments based on appearance. The use of websites like “ [Jewwatch.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jew-watch/)” and “Jewishfaces.com” as sources further underscores the article’s prejudiced perspective.
The next article,
[ “Jew War World Order,”](https://www.corruptico.com/2023/01/31/jew-war-world-order/) uses derogatory language and unfounded claims to suggest a global conspiracy led by Jewish people. The article employs phrases like “Jew war world order” and “Jew war machine,” indicating a strong anti-Semitic bias.
Finally, the article
[ “Jewish Masonic Presidential Candidates 2020”](https://www.corruptico.com/2019/08/31/jewish-masonic-presidential-candidates-2020/) suggests that various U.S. presidential candidates are part of a Jewish Masonic conspiracy. The article lacks credible sourcing and is filled with speculative claims. Based on the analysis of the article “Jewish Detection: How to Identify a Jew” and the broader pattern of content on the Corruptico website, it appears to promote harmful stereotypes, prejudice, and potentially hate speech against Jewish individuals. The site categorizes and labels people based on their appearance, which is both scientifically unfounded and ethically questionable. Given these factors, Corruptico could be considered a hate site. Readers should exercise extreme caution and skepticism when encountering such content.
