Analysis / Bias
The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) supports policies such as drug decriminalization, marijuana legalization, and safe injection sites.
Under the Issues
[section](https://drugpolicy.org/issues) of the website, the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) has identified the following topics: Decriminalize Drugs, Invest In Health & Overdose Prevention Centers, Uproot The Drug War From Civil Systems, End Policing Caused By The Drug War, Marijuana Legalization & Regulation, Rethink The “Drug Dealer.” The issues identified by the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) are generally considered progressive or left-leaning.
In review, The “Drug Facts” section on the DPA website provides information on various drugs, including marijuana. For example, The section includes a page titled “
[10 Facts About Marijuana,”](https://drugpolicy.org/drug-facts/10-facts-about-marijuana) which addresses various facts about its effects on the body, the history of its criminalization, and the racial disparities in marijuana-related arrests. The page also addresses common misconceptions about marijuana and provides information on the medical uses of the drug.
Although the page and the
[booklet](https://drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/dpa_marijuana_booklet_january2018_0.pdf) provide factual information to help people make informed decisions about marijuana use and drug policy, and the information presented on the page is generally consistent with the available research and data on marijuana, it does not include citations to sources for each fact presented. However, research is [properly sourced](https://drugpolicy.org/issues/drug-war-statistics) from credible organizations such as the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), SAMHSA.gov, and [Cato.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/).
Editorially, the DPA also advocates for policies on the human rights implications of drug policy, and they advocate for progressive policies related to drug policy reform. DPA is reasonably fact-based though they did
[fail a fact check-in 2015](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/feb/26/drug-policy-alliance/pro-pot-group-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-repeat/). They generally hold left-leaning biases based on advocacy for progressive positions on drugs and laws.
