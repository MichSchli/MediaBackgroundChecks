Analysis / Bias
In review, The Woodstock Sentinel-Review reports local and regional news through journalists with minimal loaded words like this:
[Public asked to help locate two teenage girls reported missing in Sarnia](https://www.woodstocksentinelreview.com/news/local-news/public-asked-to-help-locate-two-teenage-girls-reported-missing-in-sarnia). The national news is derived primarily from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) and [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/), whereas world news comes from multiple sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Generally, straight news reporting is factual and presents minimal biased wording; however, story selection tends to lean right.
Editorially, there is a clear right-leaning bias with commentaries. While The Woodstock Sentinel-Review does offer opposing viewpoints, on the whole, more editorials favor the conservative right.
