History
[Founded in 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/doctors4covidethics.org) by [Professor Sucharit Bhakdi, MD](https://doctors4covidethics.org/doctors-for-covid-ethics-signatories/), Doctors for Covid Ethics is an activist organization that promotes the dangers of Covid-19 vaccines. According to their [about pag](https://doctors4covidethics.org/about/)e, “We are [hundreds of doctors and scientists](https://doctors4covidethics.org/doctors-for-covid-ethics-signatories/) from all corners of the globe. We have written three letters to the European Medicines Agency, urgently warning of short term and long-term dangers from COVID-19 vaccines, including clotting, bleeding, and platelet abnormalities.” [Read our profile on Switzerland’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/switzerland-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Doctors for Covid Ethics is an advocacy group that states its
[mission](https://doctors4covidethics.org/about/) as “we are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all experimental gene-based COVID-19 vaccines. We oppose vaccine passports, which threaten public health and violate Nuremberg and other protections. We are warning that ‘health passes’ place coercive pressure on citizens to submit to dangerous medical experimentation, in return for freedoms that once were human rights.”
The mission statement above begins with
[two falsehoods](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/the-nuremberg-code-specifically-addresses-experimentation-covid-19-vaccines-arent-experimental-and-therefore-dont-violate-the-code-candace-owens/); first, the vaccines are not experimental. Second, they do not violate the Nuremberg code as vaccine passports do not force people to get vaccinated.
The website features letters the organization wrote, such as this
[Urgent Open Letter from Doctors and Scientists to the European Medicines Agency regarding COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Concerns.](https://doctors4covidethics.org/letters/doctorsforcovidethics-letters/) They also publish blog posts such as this [On COVID vaccines: why they cannot work, and irrefutable evidence of their causative role in deaths after vaccination](https://doctors4covidethics.org/on-covid-vaccines-why-they-cannot-work-and-irrefutable-evidence-of-their-causative-role-in-deaths-after-vaccination/). This article is written by Dr. Bhakdi, who frequently publishes [misinformation](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Bhakdi) regarding vaccines. Finally, the website also publishes research and published work by member doctors. In general, they are a medical disinformation organization.
