History
Founded in 2017 by
[Shonda Rhimes](https://www.shondaland.com/about/a12258201/what-we-do/), who is the creator of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” Shondaland is described on their [about page](https://www.shondaland.com/about/a12258145/who-we-are/) as “We tell stories. All-day long. Dark or light, we use our stories for good.” In general, this is an entertainment and lifestyle website that also covers politics. Shondaland lacks some transparency as they do not name an editor and do not specify whether Shonda Rhimes is the owner.

Analysis / Bias
Shondaland publishes essays, podcasts, and news about lifestyle, entertainment, and politics in review. Most content is original with a strong focus on women. Headlines and articles are often presented with minimal bias, such as this:
[Learning Everything About Cars Changed My Life](https://www.shondaland.com/live/money/a31252923/learning-everything-about-cars-changed-my-life/). This story, like most, is appropriately sourced. Shondaland covers health and wellness as well. While they report stories that involve pseudoscience, they typically state that something is not medically accepted, such as this: [Woo-Woo Wellness Is More Popular Than Ever](https://www.shondaland.com/live/body/a31294739/woo-woo-wellness-is-more-popular-than-ever/).
Editorially, Shondaland dedicates a section called “Acts” to political activism that always favors the left. For example, they oppose Republican tax plans such as this:
[How You Can (Still) Help Fight the GOP Tax Bill](https://www.shondaland.com/act/a16574153/paul-ryan-tweet-republican-tax-bill/). They also routinely report negatively on the former Trump administration, such as this: [Yes, Donald Trump Deserved to Get Booed](https://www.shondaland.com/live/a29624499/donald-trump-booed/). Generally, news and information are reasonably factual, while there is a clear left bias editorially.
