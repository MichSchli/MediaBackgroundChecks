History
[Founded in 2018](https://www.bylinefestival.com/team) by Peter Jukes and Stephen Colegrave, the Byline Times is a political website and newspaper published monthly in the UK. The website features the tagline “What the Papers Don’t Say.” On their [about page](https://bylinetimes.com/about/), they state, “While the newspaper is not politically partisan, it is not neutral and stands against corruption, injustice and the erosion of truth and the rule of law. Accurate information is the lifeblood of a democracy and, although everyone is welcome to their own opinions, facts cannot be debated.”
The website is transparent as they name authors, editors, and ownership; however, they do not clearly disclose their liberal-leaning perspectives.

Analysis / Bias
Byline Times provides originally reported political news via the website and newspaper. Reporting is broken into the categories Fact, Argument, Reportage, and Culture. Under the Fact section, they provide evidence-based reporting using historical research, official documents, and investigation. Articles and headlines under this category often contain emotionally loaded language such as this
[Unaccountable Chaos: Scathing Lords Report Criticises Government COVID Response](https://bylinetimes.com/2021/06/15/unaccountable-chaos-scathing-lords-report-criticises-government-covid-response/). Many news stories focus on what conservative do in a negative context [Lobbyists Donated£400,000to Conservative Party in Recent Years](https://bylinetimes.com/2021/04/19/lobbyists-have-donated-400000-to-conservative-party-in-recent-years/).
Under the “Argument” section they publish op-eds that often align with the left while being critical of conservatives. For example, they tend to have a negative view of conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, where they have an entire section dedicated to Johnson’s cronyism
[BORIS JOHNSON’S CRONY CONTRACTS](https://bylinetimes.com/columns/boris-johnsons-crony-contracts/). While most articles favor Labour, they can also be critical such as this [Labour’s Lost HeartlandsA Tale of Neglect, Decline, Rage & Revolt](https://bylinetimes.com/2021/05/10/labour-lost-heartlands-a-tale-of-neglect-decline-rage-and-revolt/). On the whole, many more articles and opinions favor a liberal perspective. In general, Byline Times holds a left-leaning bias and presents information factually.
