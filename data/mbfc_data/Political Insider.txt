Analysis / Bias
In review, The Political Insider reports news and opinions with a far-right conservative bias in story selection. Virtually every story favors the right while portraying the left negatively. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Narrative Fail: Statistics Show Border Deaths Declined in Trump’s First Two Years](https://thepoliticalinsider.com/narrative-fail-statistics-show-border-deaths-declined-in-trumps-first-two-years/). This story is appropriately sourced to the right-leaning [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/). Another example of loaded wording favoring the Right (Trump) can be found here: [Trump Slams ‘Staged’ Airport Rally In Support of Ilhan Omar](https://thepoliticalinsider.com/trump-slams-staged-airport-rally-in-support-of-ilhan-omar/). Political Insider also publishes news from the factually Mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). Finally, Political Insider has [published debunked conspiracy theories,](https://thepoliticalinsider.com/seth-rich-donald-trump-jr-wikileaks/) such as the fake [Wikileaks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikileaks/) report that Seth Rich delivered documents to Wikileaks and hence was murdered and the [Obama birther conspiracy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180705173602/https://thepoliticalinsider.com/sheriff-joe-obama-birth-certificate/).
The website does not distinguish between opinion and news pieces, which can be misleading. Further, each original news story features extremely right biased commentary from their authors. In general, this website features extremely biased conservative opinions that serve as a propaganda outlet for the Republican Party. Lastly, they are also listed on
