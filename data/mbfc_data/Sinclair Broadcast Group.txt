Analysis / Bias
Sinclair has been scrutinized by multiple media outlets for consistently favoring conservative politics. They are considered a
[rival to the right biased Fox News](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/business/dealbook/sinclair-media-expansion-fox-conservative-media.html?_r=0) for the conservative audience. [The Seattle Times](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020756844_fishersinclairxml.html) has written a piece documenting Sinclair’s right-wing bias.
In March 2018, Sinclair ordered its stations to produce promos with an “anchor-delivered journalistic responsibility message” dictated by the company.

[The wording of the mandated script](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html) was criticized by some station news staff and outside pundits for its discussion of “fake news,” with some critics arguing that the message used similar language and rhetoric to that of Donald Trump. Trump responded to the promos on April 2, 2018, defending the company as being “far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.”
In 2020,
[Sinclair delayed an interview](https://newsfactsnetwork.com/2020/07/26/sinclair-broadcast-group-is-delaying-airing-an-interview-with-a-conspiracy-theorist-who-baselessly-claims-dr-fauci-created-the-coronavirus/) with conspiracy theorist and [anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) activist Dr. Judy Mikovits who promotes misinformation and false information regarding Covid-19. In the interview, she claims that Dr. Fauci created Covid-19, which is [patently false](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/the-falsehoods-of-the-plandemic-video/).
