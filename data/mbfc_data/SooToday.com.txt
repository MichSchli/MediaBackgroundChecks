Analysis / Bias
SooToday.com reports the news for the Northern Ontario region with low bias such as this
[The builder of a Dubreuilville gold mine is now an owner](https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/the-builder-of-a-dubreuilville-gold-mine-is-now-an-owner-3594605). National and world news is derived from the [Canadian Press,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) which is similar to the [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) for Canada.
SooToday does not publish op-ed’s, however, when reporting on politics more stories favor the left such as this
[Trudeau ‘appalled’ by homophobic graffiti outside Ottawa mayor’s home](https://www.sootoday.com/national-news/trudeau-appalled-by-homophobic-graffiti-outside-ottawa-mayors-home-3565893). In general, the news is reported factual and with a very slight left-leaning story selection bias.
