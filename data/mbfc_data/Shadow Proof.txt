Analysis / Bias
In review, Shadow Proof uses emotional language both in their headlines and articles such as “
[WHERE WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA’S ‘DECENCY’ WHEN HE WAS DEPORTING DREAMERS?](https://shadowproof.com/2017/09/06/where-was-obama-decency-when-dreamers-deported/)” and “ [TRUMP IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT OBAMACARE WAS MADE TO BE BROKEN](https://shadowproof.com/2017/10/18/trump-is-taking-advantage-of-the-fact-that-obamacare-was-made-to-be-broken/)” and “ [READ DEA CHIEF’S RESIGNATION MEMO ADMONISHING TRUMP FOR ENDORSING POLICE MISCONDUCT.](https://shadowproof.com/2017/10/19/read-dea-chiefs-resignation-memo-admonishing-trump-endorsing-police-misconduct/)”
Shadow Proof is a strong advocate for a single-payer health care system, and they dedicated one category solely to single-payer under the category
[“ROAD TO SINGLE-PAYER.”](https://shadowproof.com/road-single-payer/) They also focus on incarceration and prisoners’ rights under the subsection [“Prison Protest.”](https://shadowproof.com/prison-protest/) Overall, Shadow Proof uses credible media sources such as [Boston Globe,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-globe/) [NYTimes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/); therefore, we rate Shadow Proof Left Biased based on political positions and wording.
