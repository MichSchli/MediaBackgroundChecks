Analysis / Bias
According to
[Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/the-news-lens-raises-series-b-to-challenge-asias-traditional-media-companies/), The News Lens has a content partnership with [Time Inc](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/)., which allows it to translate and publish articles from Time and [Fortune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fortune-magazine/).
The political content of headlines and articles use a slight right-leaning bias with loaded words such as:
[“Trump is China’s Nightmare American President”](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/58999) and [Big Data & AI Harnessed to Perfect the Police State in China](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/75151)” The majority of articles are biased and politically oriented against China; however they maintain factual reporting and use credible sources.
When reporting on the USA, they report positively, such as this
[‘Taiwanese Americans for Progress’ Plans For Post-Trump Future](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/143477). When reporting on scientific issues, they moderately favor the left, such as this [Taiwan Lacks a Plan for Meeting Climate Change Targets](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/91249).
