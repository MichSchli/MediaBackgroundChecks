History
[Launched in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/realrawnews.com), Real Raw News is an anonymously run satire website. According to their [about page](https://realrawnews.com/about-us/), “Real Raw News (realrawnews.com) is an award-winning independent publisher dedicated to exposing political and scientific corruption.” They also disclaim, “Segments of this website may contain humor, parody, or satire. We have included this disclaimer for our protection, on the advice of legal counsel.”
The primary author appears to be Michael Baxter.
On 9/24/2021, Politifact published a lengthy investigation into Real Raw News
[Hangings, guillotines, and Gitmo: Going behind Real Raw News’ sensational (and fabricated) headlines.](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/sep/24/hangings-guillotines-and-gitmo-going-behind-real-r/) According to Politifact, who has fact-checked Real Raw News a dozen times, the satire disclaimer is misleading because it only appears on the About Page. In other words, when their fake stories are shared on social media, the person reading them does not see the disclaimer and may believe the story to be true.
Our policy states that if a site disclaims they are satire, we rate them as satire.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Real Raw News publishes satirical articles for the purpose of either duping conservatives into sharing them on social media or to entertain. We previously listed this source as an extremely right-biased questionable source; however, they now correctly indicate they are satire. Although they disclaim, they are a satire website, many fact-checkers have reviewed their claims (see below). The headlines alone provide ample evidence such as this
[Hillary Clinton Hanged at GITMO](https://realrawnews.com/2021/04/hillary-clinton-hanged-at-gitmo/). This update moves Real Raw News from Questionable to Satire based on proper disclosure that the content is satirical.
It is incredible to us that fact-checkers continue to waste time fact-checking an apparent fake satire website. These fact checks serve as a promotion for the website and expand their reach to a larger audience.
