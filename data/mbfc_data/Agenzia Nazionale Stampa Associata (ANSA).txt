Analysis / Bias
ANSA reports national news with neutral headlines such as
[“EC letter almost ready says Conte;](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2019/06/14/ec-letter-almost-ready-says-conte_c081fc75-c9b2-444e-8d48-fc993662707d.html)” however, on some issues, there is a left-leaning tone, such as [“Italian population growth due to immigrants.”](https://www.ansa.it/english/news/2013/12/19/Italian-population-growth-due-to-immigrants_7373ecec-f016-41da-9b7e-090b6668e97f.html) When reporting USA news, ANSA also uses a neutral tone in their articles, such as [“Trump says he’s sending 1,000 more US troops to ally Poland.”](https://www.ansa.it/nuova_europa/en/news/sections/news/2019/06/13/trump-says-hes-sending-1000-more-us-troops-to-ally-poland_a1d2039c-ed8a-43cb-8559-6954d05084f5.html) In general, they report the news with minimal bias, and they typically do not utilize sourcing because they are the source of the reporting as a recognized news agency.
