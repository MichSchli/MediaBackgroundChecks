[Bellingcat article](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2017/05/22/yaz-gazeteci-yaz-fact-checking-anadolu-agencys-take-erdogan-bodyguard-attack/) states that “AA as a whole can only be considered as blatant and deliberate twisting and distorting of the facts.”
In review, Anadolu Agency utilizes moderately loaded emotional language in their headlines, such as
[“Merkel slams Trump for ‘harming’ global order”](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/merkel-slams-trump-for-harming-global-order-/1142431) and [“Erdogan slams world for ‘failure’ in Jerusalem test](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/erdogan-slams-world-for-failure-in-jerusalem-test/1150289).” Anadolu Agency also poorly sources as they typically source by heavily quoting without linking to the actual story.
