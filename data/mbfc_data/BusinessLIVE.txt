Analysis / Bias
BusinessLIVE newspapers, namely the Sunday Times, have been criticized for
[publishing fake stories](https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/sunday-times-admits-to-being-manipulated-17470315). The current editor BL and former editor of the Sunday Times, Ray Hartley, responded to the claims that can be read [Here.](https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/read-former-sunday-times-editor-ray-hartleys-blistering-response-to-death-squad-criticism-20181021) Further, the Independent Online newspaper criticized the newspaper Business Day for reporting more negatively on black business owners vs. white. According to the article, “Reporting on white companies is always qualified with an excuse, while black companies are treated with contempt, disdain, and suspicion.”
In review, BusinessLIVE uses strong, emotionally loaded headlines such as this
[”Cyril Ramaphosa to tackle ‘divisive’ Jacob Zuma”](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/politics/2019-01-06-cyril-ramaphosa-to-tackle-divisive-jacob-zuma/) and [“Trump tweets about land expropriation and ‘farm killings’ in SA”](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2018-08-23-trump-tweets-about-land-expropriation-and-farm-killings-in-sa/) In general, BusinessLIVE sources their information through quotes rather than hyperlinked sourcing, however, BusinessLIVE also republishes articles from [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Editorially, a review of [opinion pieces](https://www.businesslive.co.za/opinion/) reflects a right-leaning economic perspective favoring free markets.
