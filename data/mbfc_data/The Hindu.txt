Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hindu reports Indian national and international news, business, sports, and entertainment. National news lacks transparency as they do not name authors and do not provide hyperlinked sourcing. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[India has never been part of an alliance and will never be: Jaishankar](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-has-never-been-part-of-an-alliance-and-will-never-be-jaishankar/article32142128.ece?homepage=true). International news is derived mostly from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, The Hindu frequently reports negatively on conservative Prime Minister Modi and his BJP party
[BJP leader seen with accused in Bulandshahr violence](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/bjp-leader-seen-with-accused-in-bulandshahr-violence/article32126658.ece) and this [Drink cow urine to fight virus: Bengal BJP chief](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/drink-cow-urine-to-fight-virus-bengal-bjp-chief/article32119516.ece). Further, The Hindu has been [accused](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2012-01-31/india-s-top-newspapers-battle-for-readers-hearts-and-souls-choudhury) of left-leaning bias in its articles and editorials.
