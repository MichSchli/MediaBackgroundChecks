Analysis / Bias
In review, the Punching Bag Post does not produce original news stories but rather summarizes existing stories and adds conservative commentary. For example, the story
[Biden Already Taking Credit for Trump Accomplishments](https://punchingbagpost.com/2020/12/10/biden-already-taking-credit-for-trump-accomplishments/) does not utilize a single source. In another story, they promote unproven election fraud conspiracies such as this [Dominion Voting System ‘Glitched’ in Favor of Biden](https://punchingbagpost.com/2020/11/16/dominion-voting-system-glitched-in-favor-of-biden/). In general, the news reported is mixed factual and with a moderate right-leaning bias.
