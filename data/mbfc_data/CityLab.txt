Analysis / Bias
In review, CityLab divides news into five sections. “Design” focuses on urban planning. “Transportation” reports on city transportation innovations. “Environment” focuses on pollution and climate change. “Equity” covers racism, and “Life,” writes about the city lifestyle.
Articles and headlines often use minimally loaded language such as this:
[The Cities Americans Want to Flee and Where They Want to Go](https://www.citylab.com/life/2020/01/where-to-move-most-affordable-cities-apartment-list-rentals/605371/). This story is sourced to the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). A review of sources demonstrates the use of credible sources such as census information and other .gov sites.
Editorially,
[CityLab](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=citylab&gsc.sort=) leans moderately left with concern for [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) as well frequently reporting on racism such as this: [How Racism Became a Public Health Crisis in Pittsburgh](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/01/pittsburgh-racism-health-pollution-environmental-justice/603775/). When reporting on the former Trump Administration, there is often a negative tone such as this: [Trump’s Plan to Criminalize Homelessness Is Taking Shape](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/12/trump-policy-homeless-executive-order-city-services-shelters/603670/). In general, CityLab reports news factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
