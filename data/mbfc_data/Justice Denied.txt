Analysis / Bias
In review, Justice Denied is not a true news reporting source but rather a library/database of information related to those wrongfully convicted of crimes. There are 1000’s articles dating back to 1998 highlighting the many times’ justice was denied. Justice Denied has a section on the website dedicated to publishing news stories about wrongful convictions and/or justice that utilizes minimally loaded words such as this:

Justice Denied generally sticks to their mission and covers wrongful convictions with minimal bias.
