Analysis
According to a
[Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/) [article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12/agora-huckabee-conservative-bible-cures/), “Agora’s subsidiaries have tapped into a network of conservative heavyweights, including Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, and Newt Gingrich, who sell access to their massive email lists to advertise Agora’s products.”
In review, Daily Reckoning publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as this
[“The Deep State V. Trump.”](https://dailyreckoning.com/deep-state-v-trump/) A quote from the article reads, “Donald Trump has the establishment scared out of their establishment minds. That’s exciting. I love it.” In another article, [“War on Cash: The Next Phase,”](https://dailyreckoning.com/war-on-cash-the-next-phase/) they criticize the central bank digital currency (CBDC). A quote reads, “CBDCs may be coming for the banks,” and “Governments will know your whereabouts and habits at all times simply by tracking your use of funds through the CBDC payment system.” They further state, “If cash is gone, there is only one way to escape digital surveillance of wealth — physical gold.” This article fails to provide a single hyperlinked source to support the claims.
Bias
Editorially, Daily Reckoning frequently promotes gold as an investment citing sensationalized scenarios of impending doom such as this
[“The Only Way Out of the Death Trap”](https://dailyreckoning.com/the-only-way-out-of-the-death-trap/) and this [“A Tsunami Warning Has Been Issued.”](https://dailyreckoning.com/a-tsunami-warning-has-been-issued/) Further, they have an unfavorable view of President Biden and his policies [Final Nail in the Coffin.](https://dailyreckoning.com/final-nail-in-the-coffin/) Again, this story does not offer a single supporting source.
When it comes to science, they promote misinformation regarding climate change, such as this
[The Sky Is Falling](https://dailyreckoning.com/the-sky-is-falling/). In this completely unsourced piece, they use [debunked information](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as this “The best evidence is that the planet is not warming, but it may be cooling under the influence of a periodic minimum in solar flare activity.” They also promote that reducing carbon dioxide [will harm plants](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/08/co2-friend-foe-agriculture/), which is not true. Finally, they promote [misinformation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) regarding Covid-19, especially as it pertains to [mask-wearing](https://dailyreckoning.com/the-shocking-truth-about-facemasks/) and social distancing effectiveness. In general, they promote a financial perspective that best aligns with Libertarianism and is not always factual.
