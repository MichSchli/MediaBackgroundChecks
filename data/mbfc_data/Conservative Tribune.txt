Analysis / Bias
The Conservative Tribune displays extreme right-wing/conservative bias through strongly loaded emotional wording such as, “
[Scalise Digs Up Obama Dirt, Uses It To Completely Destroy Trump’s Russia Critics.”](https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/scalise-digs-obama-dirt-uses-it-completely-destroy-trumps-russia-critics/) The CT sources their information either through videos, tweets and occasionally factually mixed sources such as the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). Story selection always favors the right while denigrating the left.
The Conservative Tribune is now a social media presence that republishes conservative news and Western Journal content.
