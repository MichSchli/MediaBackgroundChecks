Analysis / Bias
In review, Slate has a politically progressive, liberal stance throughout their political articles. They publish political news with moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“The Government Shutdown Is Going to Hurt More People Each Day It Continues”](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/government-shutdown-federal-agencies-closed-furloughs.html) and [“EPA Proposes Nixing Obama-Era Rule on Mercury From Coal Plants.”](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/e-p-a-proposes-nixing-obama-era-rule-on-mercury-from-coal-plants.html) They always source credible media outlets such as [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Bloomberg,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) [Reuters,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) [The Hill,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [New York Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) Further, they also cover a [wide variety of topics](https://slate.com/culture/2018/12/stan-ollie-steve-coogan-john-c-reilly-laurel-hardy-review.html), including reviews and articles about films.
Editorially, Slate favors the left. During the 2016 Presidential Election, the Slate Staff
[endorsed](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slate_fare/2016/11/how_slate_staffers_are_voting.html) Democrat Hillary Clinton for President. In general, Slate story selection tends to favor the left and is always properly sourced.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/slate/) found that 76% of Slate’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 14% Mixed, and 10% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience strongly prefers slate.
