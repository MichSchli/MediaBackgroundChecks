Analysis / Bias
In review, Alternative Science publishes satirical content that pokes fun at pseudoscience and in particular the Trump administration and conservatives. For example these:
[Trump: “I Could Lynch Someone on 5th Avenue, But That Doesn’t Mean I’m Racist, Does It?”](https://alternative-science.com/trump-lynch/) and [Pictures Confirm Black Hole Swallowing Charlie Kirk’s Face](https://alternative-science.com/pictures-confirm-black-hole-swallowing-charlie-kirks-face/). Although, Alternative Science does not disclaim they are a satire website, the name alone implies it.
