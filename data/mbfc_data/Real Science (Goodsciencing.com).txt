History
[Launched in November 2021,](https://whois.domaintools.com/goodsciencing.com) Real Science (goodsciencing.com) is an anonymously published pseudoscience website that often publishes misleading or false claims. According to their [about page](https://goodsciencing.com/about/), “A few people have been asking who we are, what our credentials are, and what we’re trying to prove. We are a small team of investigators, news editors, journalists, and truth seekers, now backed up by others, who are discovering pieces of information that we can investigate. It doesn’t really matter who we are. What really matters is that we care carrying on an investigation and we’re presenting the evidence we’ve found, almost all of it documented in mainstream media publications.”

Analysis / Bias
Real Science (goodsciencing.com) publishes summaries of news stories from other sources. They also sometimes link to other sources such as
[True Defender](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-true-defender/), which we rate as [Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/). The website’s primary focus is on government overreach and promoting disinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. For example, in this story, [46 Children Killed By Pfizer COVID Vaccine in USA](https://goodsciencing.com/covid/46-children-killed-by-covid-vaccines-in-us/), they utilize Vaers as a source. Vaers is [not considered reliable](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19-critical-thinking-health/dont-fall-vaers-scare-tactic) because anyone can make a claim.
In another example, they again make an unproven claim by utilizing Vaers
[1616 Athlete Cardiac Arrests, Serious Issues, 1114 of Them Dead, Since COVID Injection](https://goodsciencing.com/covid/athletes-suffer-cardiac-arrest-die-after-covid-shot/). According to fact-checkers, [this is not true](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2023/01/fact-check-goodsciencing-dot-com-list-contains-obvious-noncardiac-nonvaccine-related-cases-of-dead-or-collapsed-athletes.html). In general, the website aims to spread disinformation regarding the severity and Covid-19 and the unproven dangers of the Covid Vaccine.
