Analysis / Bias
In review, KSTP.com covers news, sports, traffic, weather, and crime for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Articles and headlines rarely use load language such as this:
[Former officer Derek Chauvin transferred from county jail to maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights](https://kstp.com/news/former-officer-derek-chauvin-transferred-from-county-jail-to-maximum-security-prison-in-oak-park-heights-/5747387/). A video accompanies many news stories from the TV station. National and international news is written by staff reporters and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, KSTP does not publish opinion pieces; however, they cover politics with minimal bias, such as this:
