Analysis / Bias
In review, the Dispatch-Argus reports on news, sports, weather, crime, and entertainment for the greater Quad Cities region. Reporters demonstrate minimal bias when reporting local news, such as this
[Iowa to change unemployment process starting Jan. 9](https://qconline.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/iowa-to-change-unemployment-process-starting-jan-9/article_278dcd50-2afd-5687-98d1-cda741d49beb.html). Further, the website publishes national and international news from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Finally, all information is sourced via first-person accounts or through credible media.
Editorially, the Dispatch-Argus News reasonably represents both sides. A review of editorial articles demonstrates a reasonable low bias; however, slightly more op-eds favor the right such as this
[WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING: A simple ask, Gov. Pritzker](https://qconline.com/opinion/editorial/what-others-are-saying-a-simple-ask-gov-pritzker/article_34fc4115-c622-5a0d-835e-cdcecce0487b.html). While more op-eds favor the right, liberal perspectives have fair representation; therefore, they earn a least biased rating on the right side of the scale. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
