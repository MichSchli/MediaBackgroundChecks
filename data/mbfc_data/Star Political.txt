Analysis / Bias
In review, Star Political uses emotional language in headlines such as this:
[CNN Host CRIES ON LIVE TELEVISION; Says Itâ€™s Because Trump is Mean](https://starpolitical.com/cnn-host-cries-on-live-television-says-its-because-trump-is-mean/). Like most information on this website, it leads to other right-leaning sites. In general, all stories here favor the right and denigrate the left.
While this source has not failed a fact check, their sources and information are questionable.
