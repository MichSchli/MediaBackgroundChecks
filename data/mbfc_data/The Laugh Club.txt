The Laugh Club completely lacks transparency by not offering an about page, and author names; however, the contact page does indicate the website is owned by Newsner and is produced by N365 Group.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Laugh Club appears to be a satire website that does not disclose they are satire. For example, this story:
[You can now buy a portable toilet, so you can poop anywhere your heart desires](https://www.thelaughclub.net/internet/you-can-now-buy-a-portable-toilet-so-you-can-poop-anywhere-your-heart-desires/). While this may be a real product, I am sure the intent is to make people laugh, but there is not a disclaimer here. They also promote far-out pseudoscience such as this: [People are claiming Greta Thunberg is a time traveler from 1898 after baffling photo](https://www.thelaughclub.net/weird/people-are-claiming-greta-thunberg-is-a-time-traveler-from-1898-after-baffling-photo/). Either way, this is a website that promotes fake news, similar to Newsner.
