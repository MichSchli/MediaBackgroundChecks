Analysis / Bias
Quds News Network is reported to have
[affiliations](https://apnews.com/article/ac9819f1d94c4733bbc54932941f509e) with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Regarding content and editorial stance, Quds News Network clearly focuses on Palestinian perspectives and issues. This is evident in the choice of stories, the framing of narratives, and the emphasis on topics that resonate with Palestinian and pro-Palestinian audiences.
Articles, such as
[ “Israel rejects swap to free all detainees](https://qudsnen.co/israel-rejects-swap-to-free-all-detainees/)” reports on a statement by an Israeli military spokesperson rejecting a proposal by Hamas for a detainee swap, which would involve the release of all Israeli detainees in Gaza in exchange for all Palestinians held in Israeli jails. It includes statements from Hamas leaders and references protests in Tel Aviv supporting the deal. This article cites WAFA as a source but does not include hyperlinks to verify its claims. However, the content seems to be based on public statements from representatives of both Israel and Hamas.
Quds News Network also republishes stories from left-leaning sources like
[Middle East Eye](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/middle-east-eye/) and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), including articles such as [“Ukraine and Palestine: How the West embraces one resistance but demonises another”](https://qudsnen.co/ukraine-and-palestine-how-the-west-embraces-one-resistance-but-demonises-another/) and [“Welcoming Benjamin Netanyahu to No 10 is an insult to British Palestinians like me.”](https://qudsnen.co/welcoming-benjamin-netanyahu-to-no-10-is-an-insult-to-british-palestinians-like-me/) In general, Quds News Network demonstrates a strong pro-Palestinian bias and engages in advocacy related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. They also frequently fail fact-checks, resulting in a low factual rating.
