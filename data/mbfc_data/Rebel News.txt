Analysis / Bias
Rebel News routinely publishes news with loaded emotional wording that favors the right, such as this:
[Why Trudeau’s Liberals are pretending THIS gun control study doesn’t exist](https://www.therebel.media/gun-control-canada-laws-study-brad-trost-firearms-sheila-gunn-reid), and this [Cops bundle up angry left-wing student in taped meltdown](https://www.therebel.media/police-arrest-antifa-student-meltdown-screaming-maga-hat). Both of these stories are linked to strongly right-leaning sources such as [Campus Reform](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/campus-reform/). In general, most stories favor the right and denigrate the left. Further, according to the right-leaning, The National, The Rebel has been accused of [stirring up anti-Muslim hate](https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/canada-s-rebel-media-causing-anti-muslim-hate-report-says-1.832726). Some writers for The Rebel have also [been profiled](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/11/07/lauren-southern-alt-right%E2%80%99s-canadian-dog-whistler) by the left-leaning [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) for promoting hatred.
When it comes to sourcing, The Rebel does hyperlink to outside sources, but they often attempt to source within their domain to increase web traffic. Finally, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have repeatedly made false and misleading claims, as evidenced in the below-failed fact checks. In general, this is a far-right media source that is not always factual.
