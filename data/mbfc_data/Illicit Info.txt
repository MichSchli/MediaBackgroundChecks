Analysis / Bias
In review, Illicit Info publishes news stories from other sources and offers opinions that are always favorable to the right and negative to the left. Headlines frequently use extremely loaded sensational language such as this:
[Ocasio-Cortez’s Financial Records Expose Her As A Total Fraud, Green Pipe Dream Pusher Is A Total Hypocrite Frequent Flyer](https://illicitinfo.com/3083/).
When choosing news stories, they often select extreme right-biased Questionable sources such as the
[Conservative Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-tribune/) and [The Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), both of which have terrible track records with fact-checkers. They also use [credible sources](https://illicitinfo.com/495/) such as [Cleveland.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-plain-dealer/) but then spin a factual story into a conspiracy narrative, such as this: “Maybe I’m channeling Danny Reagan, but the cause of death just isn’t consistent with suicide. People just don’t beat themselves to death.”
After the 2020 Presidential election, they frequently promoted fraud disinformation and false claims regarding Covid-19, such as this
