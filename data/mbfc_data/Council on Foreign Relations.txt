History
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR),
[founded in 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations), is a United States 4900-member organization, nonprofit, publisher, and think tank specializing in U.S. foreign policy and international affairs. The CFR meetings convene government officials, global business leaders, and prominent intelligence and foreign-policy community members to discuss international issues.
CFR also publishes the least biased bi-monthly
[Foreign Affairs Magazine.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-affairs/) The current President is [Richard N. Haass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_N._Haass). [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Council on Foreign Relations is funded through “member dues; annual giving by members (in recent years, over one-third of CFR members have chosen to participate);
[corporate memberships](https://www.cfr.org/membership/corporate-membership); [Foreign Affairs](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/) magazine (subscriptions, advertising, events); grants from foundations, corporations, and individuals; investment returns from its endowment; and rental income from outside use of CFR’s New York and Washington facilities.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, CFR’s mission is to be “a resource for its members, government officials, business executives, journalists, educators and students, civic and religious leaders, and other interested citizens to help them better understand the world and the foreign policy choices facing the United States and other countries.”
The CFR website reports news with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[North Korea’s Military Capabilities](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/north-koreas-military-capabilities). This story is properly sourced to [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), among other High factual sources. When reporting on the Trump administration, they tend to have a slightly negative view of President Trump’s foreign policy: [Trouble With the Facts When Trump Meets Imran Khan](https://www.cfr.org/blog/trouble-facts-when-trump-meets-imran-khan).
CFR supports the consensus of science regarding
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) when it comes to science: [Making Trade Work to Mitigate Climate Change](https://www.cfr.org/blog/making-trade-work-mitigate-climate-change).
The Council on Foreign Relations has faced criticism from conservatives due to their alleged support for
[globalism and a one world government](https://www.conservapedia.com/Council_on_Foreign_Relations). CFR has also been criticized by conspiracy theorists who feel they are a part of the [New World Order](http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/root_con.html). In general, CFR reports news accurately and with minimal bias. They do not advocate for war and generally promote peaceful solutions to foreign affairs issues.
