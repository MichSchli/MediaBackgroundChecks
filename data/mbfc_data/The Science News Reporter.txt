Analysis / Bias
From our previous review in 2019: The Science News Reporter usually publishes science-related news that is focused on environmental issues such as this:
[Bumblebee Has Officially Been Added To The Ever-Growing List Of Endangered Species](https://www.thescinewsreporter.com/2019/04/bumblebee-has-officially-been-added-to.html). This story and most science-related stories are sourced properly through quotes or hyperlinks. On the other hand, The Science News Reporter also publishes satire that is not labeled as such. While stories such as this, [Scientists: Earth Endangered By New Strain of Fact-Resistant Humans,](https://www.thescinewsreporter.com/2019/04/scientists-earth-endangered-by-new.html) should be obvious, if not appropriately labeled, and can mislead some people, such as the fact-resistant humans mentioned in this humorous article. In general, most stories are true and sourced back to factual information; however, this website is very misleading by not labeling satire stories, and there is evidence of plagiarism.
In early 2023, it appears the old content has been removed, but they still lack transparency. On the date of this review, webpages were not loading, returning error messages.
