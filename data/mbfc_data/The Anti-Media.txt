Analysis / Bias
In review, The Anti-Media publishes news that is broken into three categories: Our News, Their News, and My News. “Our News” consists of primarily original stories written by TAM. “Their News” leads to outside conspiracy sources such as Middle East Eye,
[Mint Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mint-press-news/), and [Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). The “My News” section is news stories that are shared by readers.
The Our News section best reflects the direction and bias of this website. A review of articles found here reveals numerous instances of conspiracy theories being promoted such as false flags:
[The 12 Strongest Arguments That Douma Was a False Flag](https://theantimedia.com/douma-false-flag/). This story is sourced to a combination of credible sources such as [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/) as well as full-blown conspiracy websites such as the [Corbett Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-corbett-report/). When it comes to science The Anti-Media [does not support the consensus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) with [GMOs](https://theantimedia.com/congress-literally-thinks-americans-are-too-dumb-to-have-gmo-food-labeling/) and promotes [9/11 conspiracies](https://theantimedia.com/9-11-mastermind-saudi-arabia-role/). In general, the Anti-Media reports some factual stories as well as some that are conspiracy and pseudoscience.
