Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Discord is a satire website that primarily pokes fun at right-wing conspiracy theorists. Though they don’t openly advertise their satire, they make it clear through article headlines such as this
[Former Cuomo Secretary Describes Old Boss As “Stern But Even Handed”](http://www.dailydiscord.com/?p=24302) and [The GOP Isn’t Dead, It’s Simply MAGAmorphosing](http://www.dailydiscord.com/?p=24212). While we want sources to state their mission as a satire site clearly, this source is not deceptive.
