History
[Founded in 2016](http://whois.domaintools.com/influencewatch.org), Influence Watch is a project of the conservative think tank [Capital Research Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/capital-research-center/). According to their [about page](https://www.influencewatch.org/about-us/), “Capital Research Center conceived of this project after identifying a need for more fact-based, accurate descriptions of all of the various influencers of public policy issues.” In simpler terms, Influence Watch attempts to be the right-leaning counter to the left-leaning [Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), which profiles how and where think tanks, organizations, and media are funded.
Funded By / Ownership
Capital Research Center owns Influence Watch, which in turn is funded through donations. Some of their
[top donors](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Capital_Research_Center) are Exxon-Mobil, Koch Industries, and the [Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/capital-research-center/) “CRC’s president is Scott Walter, who took office in 2016. A philanthropic consultant and former editor of publications released by the Philanthropy Roundtable and [American Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-enterprise-institute/).”
Influence Watch has also been
[directly funded](https://www.prwatch.org/news/2017/12/13310/%E2%80%98influence-watch%E2%80%99-website-launched-berman-alec-heartland-copy-cmd%E2%80%99s) by the Bradley Foundation and the John William Pope Foundation. The common theme among all donors is conservative political affiliation and ties to the fossil fuel industry.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Influence Watch profiles non-profits, for-profits, labor unions, and groups, detailing their funding and political affiliation. Where Sourcewatch tends to profile right-leaning organizations, Influence Watch profiles more left-leaning organizations, influence Watch also profiles activist groups such as
[Black Lives Matter](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/black-lives-matter-foundation/) and [ANTIFA](https://www.influencewatch.org/movement/antifa/), which they describe as “extreme left and violent.” The sourcing used for the ANTIFA profile comes from credible sources such as [The Economist](https://www.influencewatch.org/movement/antifa/) and [The Atlantic](https://www.influencewatch.org/movement/antifa/). Influence Watch also profiles movements such as the [Fight for $15 (Minimum Wage](https://www.influencewatch.org/movement/fight-for-15-minimum-wage/)), which they portray negatively, calling the idea a “radical policy.” Influence Watch also profiles [numerous organizations](https://www.influencewatch.org/?s=climate+change) that are concerned with [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Their profile of 350.org, an environmental group that opposes new oil, gas, and coal exploration, labels them “extreme left-wing policy.”
In general, Influence Watch uses strongly loaded words to describe the organizations they are profiling, often labeling them extremists. However, as biased as their words may be, the information is properly sourced, and while they may bring attention to climate change activists, they do not state denial of global warming.
