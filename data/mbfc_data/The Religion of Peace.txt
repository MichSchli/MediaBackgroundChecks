History
[Founded in 2002](http://whois.domaintools.com/thereligionofpeace.com), The Religion of Peace (TROP) is a website that reports on the negative aspects of Islam. According to The Religion of Peace [about page](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/site/about-site.aspx), they are “a pluralistic, non-partisan site concerned with Islam’s political and religious teachings according to its own texts. The purpose is to counter whitewashing and explain the threat that Islam truly poses to human dignity and freedom, as well as the violence and dysfunction that ensues as a direct consequence of this religion’s supremacist ideology.” The editor of TROP is [Glen Roberts](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/site/donation.aspx). We cannot find much information on Glen Roberts and suspect this may be a pseudonym.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Religion of Peace promotes anti-Muslim propaganda by only posting negative information about Islam, such as crimes that may not be related to one’s religion,
[such as this](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/thieves-break-into-armenian-orthodox-church-in-istanbuls-beyoglu-steal-artefacts.aspx?pageID=517&nID=118004&NewsCatID=509) where they link to a [Mixed factual source](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hurriyet-daily-news/). On the homepage, they keep a running count of terror attacks and people killed by Muslims in what they call the Jihad Report.
Along the right side of the page, they publish curated news from various sources. Some of these sources are on our questionable or conspiracy list, such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), and [MEMRI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/middle-east-media-research-institute-memri/). However, for the most part, most news links from credible right and left-leaning sources, such as the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and local newspapers, with the common theme of reporting negative news regarding Muslims.
