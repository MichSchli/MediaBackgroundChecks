Analysis / Bias
BreakingNews.ie, is owned by The Irish Times, which is known to have a left-leaning editorial bias. In terms of bias, BreakingNews.ie, uses minimal loaded language and relies on credible sources to support its news articles, such as its sister publications. Most of its local news stories, like
[“Journalists at BBC Northern Ireland vote to strike over Radio Foyle cutbacks,”](https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/nuj-members-at-bbc-northern-ireland-vote-to-strike-over-radio-foyle-cutbacks-1471383.html) are objectively presented and sourced with quotes.
However, the website occasionally shows a left-leaning bias in its political news coverage. For example, an article titled
[“Ireland may have to consider changing laws around trans prisoners – Varadkar”](https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/ireland-may-have-to-consider-changing-laws-around-trans-prisoners-varadkar-1451099.html) favors social liberal causes.
International news is also occasionally covered with a left-leaning bias, as seen in an article titled
[“Donald Trump’s return to Doonbeg a quieter affair than his presidential visit”](https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/donald-trumps-return-to-doonbeg-a-quieter-affair-than-his-presidential-visit-1471320.html) The article’s title uses the word “quieter” to describe Trump’s return, the choice in wording shows a slight bias against former President Donald Trump. In comparison a similar article on President Biden utilizes more favorable wording [“Biden’s trip to Ireland outlines ‘optimism’ ahead of expected run for second term.”](https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/irish-trip-reinforces-bidens-optimism-ahead-of-expected-run-for-second-term-1463205.html) In general, BreakingNews.ie is fact-based and holds moderate left-leaning bias.
