Analysis / Bias
In review, articles are primarily written by Jeffrey Lord or Lord Staff. Story selection always favors the right and utilizes moderate loaded language such as this
[Biden’s Monumental Monument Problem](https://thejeffreylord.com/bidens-monumental-monument-problem/). This story is sourced to the factually mixed [Mediaite](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mediaite/) and the credible [Philadephia Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/philadelphia-tribune/). Other stories are sourced to the right-leaning [American Spectator](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-spectator/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and Questionable [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/).
Thejeffreylord.com primarily publishes editorial pieces that routinely favor a conservative perspective. For instance, they never criticize former President Trump and often celebrate his accomplishments such as this:
[BOOM! Record 2.5 Million Jobs Added in May, Trump Signs Bill to Ease PPP Restrictions](https://thejeffreylord.com/boom-record-2-5-million-jobs-added-in-may-trump-signs-bill-to-ease-ppp-restrictions/), while consistently denigrating the left [In Their Guts, Americans Know The Left Has Gone Nuts](https://thejeffreylord.com/in-their-guts-americans-know-the-left-has-gone-nuts/).
Since 2020, the website has frequently promoted conspiracy theories related to Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud and Covid-19. For example, they claimed there were duplicate ballots in Arizona,
[which was not true](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/did-the-maricopa-county-audit-find). They have also falsely claimed that “influenza kills more people and children annually by 100s of thousands but who’s counting really?” [Again, not true](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu). Generally, thejeffreylord.com is a strongly right-leaning opinion site that sometimes publishes false or misleading information.
