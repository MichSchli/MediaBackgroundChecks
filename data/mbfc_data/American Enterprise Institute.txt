According to their about page: “The American Enterprise Institute is a public policy think tank dedicated to defending human dignity, expanding human potential, and building a freer and safer world. The work of our scholars and staff advances ideas rooted in our belief in democracy, free enterprise, American strength and global leadership, solidarity with those at the periphery of our society, and a pluralistic, entrepreneurial culture.”

Analysis / Bias
According to
[Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000031480&cycle=A) AEI almost exclusively supports Republican candidates through donations.
In review, AEI is closely associated with conservatism and neoconservatism, although it claims to be non-partisan. Policy-wise they advocate for lower taxes, fewer protections for consumers and the environment, and cuts to the social safety net. In articles, they use minimally loaded words and generally source properly. However, there is the moderate use of loaded words, especially when discussing climate change:
