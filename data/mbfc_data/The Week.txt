Analysis / Bias
This review covers the US edition only. The Week publishes political news with emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“How Bernie Sanders would dismantle the American empire”](https://theweek.com/articles/825202/how-bernie-sanders-dismantle-american-empire) and [“Trump apparently once burst into a White House meeting to rave about a picture of Abraham Lincoln.”](https://theweek.com/speedreads/826623/trump-apparently-once-burst-into-white-house-meeting-rave-about-picture-abraham-lincoln) Further, they source from credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Bloomberg,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [The Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-nation/). They also have a section called [“5 Things you need to know](https://theweek.com/5things/826556/trump-kim-describe-two-different-versions-summits-collapse), “ which summarizes the top 5 news stories of the day derived from credible media sources.
Editorially and politically, The Week presents opinions with left-wing bias and frequent negative reports on former President Donald Trump, such as this:
[“Donald Trump is the worst presidential negotiator in history.”](https://theweek.com/articles/826391/donald-trump-worst-presidential-negotiator-history) In general, news reporting falls within the left-center category; however, editorially, they are strongly left-biased.
