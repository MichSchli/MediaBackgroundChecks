Analysis / Bias
Transit Tomorrow publishes news and information related to Transportation Technologies. Articles and headlines are minimally biased in word choices, such as
[Transit Tomorrow: Charting the Course for Travel and Transportation Technologies](https://transittomorrow.com/transit-tomorrow-travel-transportation-tech/). Although not labeled promotional, it primarily emphasizes the product’s benefits and lacks critical balance.
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they do report on political issues related to the industry, like
[New York’s Green Transit, Green Jobs Bill: Emissions and Jobs](https://transittomorrow.com/green-transit-green-jobs-bill-new-york/). In reviewing dozens, a slight majority of politically related pieces lean slightly left in favoring a liberal perspective. In general, they are fact-based, but the content sometimes blurs the lines by not indicating which stories are promotional.
