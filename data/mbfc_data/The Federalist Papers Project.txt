History
[Founded in 2011](http://whois.domaintools.com/thefederalistpapers.org), The Federalist Papers Project is far-right news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://thefederalistpapers.org/about), the mission of the Federalist Papers Project “is to get people the power that knowledge gives to motivate them to push back at the erosion of our liberties and restore the constitutionally limited small government.” The founder and director of FPP are [Steve Straub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sstraub?trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1).

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Federalist Papers Project offers two types of content. First, they republish content from the right-leaning and factually mixed
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), and the other is original opinion pieces that utilize strongly loaded language in favor of the right. Here are some examples: [This Is The List of Every Current National Emergency And It Is A Nightmare For Dems](https://thefederalistpapers.org/opinion/list-every-current-national-emergency-nightmare-dems) and [Jim Acosta Insults Angel Moms Then Gets Owned By One](https://thefederalistpapers.org/opinion/jim-acosta-insults-angel-moms-gets-owned-one). In both of these examples, there is zero sourcing of any kind to support their claims.
Generally, every story on the Federalist Papers Project favors the right and denigrates the left. The FPP also promotes right-wing conspiracies, such as the
[Clinton’s](https://thefederalistpapers.org/opinion/bombshell-new-info-bodies-2-dead-black-men-found-home-clinton-donor) being responsible for numerous deaths and promoting [deep state conspiracies](https://thefederalistpapers.org/opinion/trump-shreds-sessions-aiding-abetting-deep-state-coup).
