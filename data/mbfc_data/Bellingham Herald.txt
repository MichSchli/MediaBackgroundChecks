Analysis / Bias
In review, the Bellingham Herald covers local news through journalists, while national and international news is provided by other Chatham publications and the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). News articles sometimes contain emotionally-charged headlines that have a critical tone toward the Trump administration, such as in the article [“Whatcom County asked Trump for $53K for Lynden rally security. A year later, no response.”](https://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/article148989564.html) However, most local news stories contain minimally biased wording such as this: [Whatcom County’s cold temperatures may be to blame in fatal trailer fire.](https://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/article239351758.html#storylink=hpdigest_local) Regarding sourcing, the Bellingham Herald often hyperlinks to itself and to credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and the University of Washington.
Editorially, the Bellingham Herald does not endorse Presidential candidates; however, in 2016, they featured editorials highly critical of then-Republican Candidate Donald Trump:
[I’m not in the mood for ‘unity.’ Trump’s still a bigot](https://www.bellinghamherald.com/opinion/article115097143.html). In general, news reporting is factual with a left-leaning editorial bias.
