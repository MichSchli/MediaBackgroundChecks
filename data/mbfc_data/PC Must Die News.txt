History
[Founded in 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/pcmustdie.com), PC Must Die News is an ultra-conservative pro-Trump news and opinion source. According to their [about page](https://pcmustdie.com/about-us/), they state “We are not a satire or fake news site”, as well as “We are comprised of Conservatives, Libertarians, and Constitutionalists who support America and our Constitution. We support the 2nd amendment, freedom of speech, and other American values.” This website completely lacks transparency as it does not provide bios for authors or disclose ownership information.

Analysis / Bias
In review, PC Must Die News does not publish original news content, but rather takes an existing story and quotes it while offering right-leaning opinions. For example, in this story,
[California says independents can vote for Democrats’ 2020 primary, but not Republicans’](https://pcmustdie.com/california-says-independents-can-vote-for-democrats-2020-primary-but-not-republicans/), which is taken almost word for word from the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-21/california-independent-voters-can-cast-ballots-for-democrats-not-trump-march-2020-primary). Basically, the website rewords news stories from other sources. Some of these sources are [not pro-science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as this: [New Finnish Study Finds No Evidence For Man-Made Climate Change](https://pcmustdie.com/new-finnish-study-finds-no-evidence-for-man-made-climate-change/). Another category on the website is called “Instant Karma”, which generally highlights minorities committing crimes while using racial slurs such as this: [Thug Trying To Mug Woman Gets Beaten Senseless, Begs Her to Call the Cops](https://pcmustdie.com/thug-trying-to-mug-woman-gets-beaten-senseless-begs-her-to-call-the-cops/). This website also supports Trump: [Pair of Anit-Trumpers try to Fight Trump Supporter and get Whooped on Video](https://pcmustdie.com/pair-of-anit-trumpers-try-to-fight-trump-supporter-and-get-whooped-on-video/) and denigrates liberals [Trevor Noah asks Hillary Clinton how she killed Jeffrey Epstein](https://pcmustdie.com/trevor-noah-asks-hillary-clinton-how-she-killed-jeffrey-epstein/).
In general, this is a source that is questionable due to fake news, extreme bias, and poor sourcing.
