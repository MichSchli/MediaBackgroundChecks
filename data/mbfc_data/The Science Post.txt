In review, The Science Post produces satirical news articles on health, science, and politics. A sample article reads
[COVID-19 officially endorses Donald Trump for President.](http://thesciencepost.com/covid-19-officially-endorses-donald-trump-for-president/) However, some articles are based on real news stories that then add a satirical twist, such as this [New law makes it legal for atheist doctors and nurses to refuse care to religious patients](http://thesciencepost.com/new-law-makes-it-legal-for-atheist-doctors-and-nurses-to-refuse-care-to-religious-patients/). In general, this is a satire website that clearly labels its intentions.
