History
Christianscience.com is a website dedicated to news about Christian Science.
[Christian Science](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Christian_Science) is a pseudoscientific and overtly religious belief system founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1866, based on the idea that Christianity is a verifiable set of beliefs. The central texts of Christian Science are the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, Science & Health With Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy. There is irony in the term Christian Science as Christianity is a set of dogmatic beliefs, which is opposed to Science which is a method that strictly avoids dogma.
