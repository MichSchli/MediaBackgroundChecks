History
[Founded in 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Security_Policy), The Center for Security Policy (CSP) is a Washington, D.C.-based national security think tank that has been widely accused of engaging in conspiracy theorizing by a range of individuals, media outlets, and organizations. Its activities are focused on exposing and researching perceived jihadist threats to the United States. The [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) has described it as “a conspiracy-oriented mouthpiece for the growing anti-Muslim movement in the United States.”
The founder and President is
[Frank Gaffney, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gaffney,_Jr.), [described](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/4-conspiracy-theories-promoted-by-cruz-s-new-adviser-1.5419391) as an “American anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The CSP publishes news related to USA security, focusing on the dangers of Islam. News headlines are somewhat sensationalized and often demonize Islam, such as this:
[Gaffney: Christian persecution taking place around the world is “simply unimaginable](https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2019/10/30/gaffney-christian-persecution-taking-place-around-the-world-is-simply-unimaginable/).” This story was published on the Questionable [Breitbart News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Editorially, CSP favors former President Trump, such as this:
[The Anti-Trump Conspiracy Probe Goes Criminal](https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2019/10/25/the-anti-trump-conspiracy-probe-goes-criminal/), and denigrates the left: [AOC’s Weak Attempt to Paint Trump’s Criticism of Rep. Schiff as “Anti-Semitic.”](https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2019/10/09/aocs-weak-attempt-to-paint-trumps-criticism-of-rep-schiff-as-anti-semitic/) This last story is properly sourced.

In general, CSP favors a neoconservative policy that is hawkish toward Islam.
