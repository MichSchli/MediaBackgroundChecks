Funded by / Ownership
[Autoblog](https://www.autoblog.com/about-us/) was initially owned by Weblogs, Inc., a company co-founded by Jason Calacanis and Brian Alvey. [Verizon Media](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/03/verizons-aol-trial-has-expired/), a former subsidiary of Verizon Communications, later acquired it. Only Verizon Media, not the entire Verizon company, is now owned by [Apollo Global Management](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/29/yahoo-apollo-renaissance-jim-lanzone/) and operates under the Yahoo name. However, Autoblog does not transparently disclose this ownership information. [Advertising](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/dashboard/index.html) generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
For our analysis, we examined several articles from Autoblog, many of which were republished from other outlets such as
[Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). In terms of articles either published directly by Autoblog or its parent company, Yahoo, the piece titled [“Trump’s Latest Villain: Electric Vehicles”](https://www.autoblog.com/2023/09/26/trumps-latest-villain-electric-vehicles/) contains emotionally loaded language and adopts a critical tone against [Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/).
The article includes emotionally loaded language such as “The EV attack is a classic Trump tactic,” “Nobody makes enemies like Donald Trump,” and “The absurd embellishment is Trump’s claim about all the EVs coming from China.” Sources cited are
[Wired](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired/), [WhiteHouse.gov,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/) [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). It also portrays Biden’s plans for EVs in a positive light.
Another article,
[“Here’s the car that sparked a massive 1,500-vehicle fire at London airport car park”](https://www.autoblog.com/2023/10/12/heres-the-car-that-sparked-a-massive-1500-vehicle-fire-at-london-airport-car-park/), discusses a fire incident at Luton airport’s parking lot near London. The article aims to clarify that the massive fire at a London airport car park was caused by a diesel-powered car, not an electric vehicle (EV), dispelling any misconceptions about EV safety. It cites [The Independent UK](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/), which has a Mixed factual, left-center bias rating, and factually low sources, such as [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), which has a Right bias rating. In general, Autoblog is mostly fact-based and holds left-leaning editorial biases through story selection.
