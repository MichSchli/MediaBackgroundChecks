History
[Founded by Bob Livingston in 2003](http://whois.domaintools.com/personalliberty.com), Personal Liberty is an ultra-conservative news and opinion website. The website is a product of [The Bob Livingston Letter](http://www.boblivingstonletter.com/?utm_source=PL&utm_medium=whoIs&utm_campaign=bobWhoIs&SC=B20174842), founded in 1969. Bob Livingston [claims](https://personalliberty.com/about-bob-livingston/) to have had 4 heart attacks 45 years ago but never had surgery due to alternative health practices, which makes him a supposed health expert.

Analysis /Bias
In review, Personal Liberty could easily be classified as both a conspiracy and pseudoscience website, however, the content is also highly political favoring the right. For example, they frequently rail against globalists and praise President Trump such as this
[The conspiracy to kill Trump](https://personalliberty.com/conspiracy-kill-trump/). Like most stories, this is completely unsourced and is the opinion of the author. When it comes to science this is not a reputable source on any level. They deny human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as this [Climate scientists: Alarm over global warming ‘based on nonsense’ and ‘irrational at best’](https://personalliberty.com/climate-scientists-alarm-global-warming-based-nonsense-irrational-best/) and promote [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) [Vaccination 101: Why vaccines are useless, inefficient and dangerous](https://personalliberty.com/vaccination-101-why-vaccines-are-useless-inefficient-and-dangerous/). Finally, there are ample conspiracy theories found here such as the Clintons murdering people, [Hillary is a deranged sociopathic war criminal who should be indicted for conspiracy and murder](https://personalliberty.com/hillary-deranged-sociopathic-war-criminal-indicted-conspiracy-murder/), and labeling the Coronavirus a hoax, as seen here [The coronavirus hoax](https://personalliberty.com/the-coronavirus-hoax/).
In general, Personal Liberty is an extreme right-biased website that promotes conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience, and is very poorly sourced.
