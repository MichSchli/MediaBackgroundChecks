Analysis / Bias
In review, Listverse produces lists that are designed to be clickbait for the purpose of social media sharing. Lists are submitted by users as well as written by staff. Lists typically have sensational headlines such as this:
[10 Disturbing Facts About The Rostov Ripper, Andrei Chikatilo](https://listverse.com/2020/01/07/10-disturbing-facts-about-andrei-39the-rostov-ripper39-chikatilo/). While these facts may be credible, there isn’t a single source used to verify their accuracy.
Listverse also creates lists based on politics that cover both sides, such as
[10 Reasons Democrats Shouldn’t Want Joseph Biden Nominated](https://listverse.com/2019/10/19/ten-reasons-democrats-shouldnt-want-joseph-biden-nominated/) and this [10 Dark Secrets Of Donald J. Trump](https://listverse.com/2016/09/24/10-dark-secrets-of-donald-j-trump/). However, when reviewing numerous political lists, the majority are positive toward conservatives and negative toward liberals such as this: [10 Biggest Scandals Of The Obama Presidency](https://listverse.com/2019/11/07/obama-presidency-scandals/). This story is properly sourced to various credible outlets such as [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/). At the same time, this next story reads like a white nationalist’s checklist: [10 Indications That Western Society Is Collapsing](https://listverse.com/2018/04/13/10-indications-that-western-society-is-collapsing/).
Listverse also frequently creates lists based on conspiracy theories and pseudoscience; however, these lists are not an endorsement but rather information about those topics.
