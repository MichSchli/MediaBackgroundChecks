History
Founded in early 2020 by Steven Hayes (
[Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/)) and Jonah Goldberg ( [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/)), The Dispatch is a news and opinion newsletter, podcast, and website reporting from a conservative perspective. According to their [about page](https://thedispatch.com/about?utm_source=menu-dropdown), “We are a digital media company providing engaged citizens with fact-based reporting and commentary on politics, policy, and culture—informed by conservative principles. We deliver that work in newsletters, articles, and podcasts.” Steven Hayes serves as CEO and editor, while Jonah Goldberg serves as Editor-in-Chief.
On May 15, 2020, The Dispatch became a
[signatory](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/) of the International Fact-Checking Network, which sets uniform standards for fact-checkers to abide by. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Dispatch provides a daily newsletter to subscribers, several podcasts, and a website that displays free news and opinion content, including fact checks. Articles and headlines often use moderately loaded emotional language:
[Bernie Sanders and the Rise of Woke Marxism](https://thedispatch.com/p/bernie-sanders-and-the-rise-of-woke). This story, like most, is well written and adequately sourced to credible media outlets such as the [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/).
Editorially, story selection often favors the more centrist right with stories moderately negative toward Democrats, such as this
[Why Is the Democratic Party Even Having Another Debate?](https://thedispatch.com/p/why-is-the-democratic-party-even), while at the same time not consistently reporting favorably on former President Trump, such as this: [Trump Has a Chance to Unite Americans on Coronavirus](https://thedispatch.com/p/trump-has-a-chance-to-unite-americans). A quote from the article reads, “It appears finally to have been enough for Donald Trump. The president, who in recent weeks has frequently downplayed the severity of the coronavirus, addressed the nation about the crisis Wednesday night.”
We do not review podcasts; however, we reviewed The Dispatch’s fact checks and found them credible and accurate. A review of their fact checks demonstrates that they check both Democrats and Republicans, such as this:
[Has Donald Trump ‘Always Known’ Coronavirus ‘Is a Pandemic’?](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/has-donald-trump-always-known-coronavirus) and [Did Joe Biden Really Say ‘We Can Only Re-Elect Donald Trump’?](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/did-joe-biden-really-say-we-can-only) (The Dispatch is a signatory of the International Fact-Checking Network, which MBFC uses to fact-check sources) In general, The Dispatch reports news factually with a moderate conservative bias in story selection and editorial content.
