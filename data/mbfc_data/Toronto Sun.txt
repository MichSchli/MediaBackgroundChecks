History
The Toronto Sun is a daily newspaper based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
When
[The Toronto Evening Telegram](https://torontoist.com/2012/10/historicist-the-sun-rises-the-telegram-sets/) folded, then foreign correspondent of the telegram, [Peter John Vickers Worthington](https://torontosun.com/2013/05/13/toronto-sun-founding-editor-peter-worthington-dead-at-86/wcm/d766370c-a571-4981-a696-88ef36a346d0), and former employees founded the Toronto Sun in 1971. Worthington was editor-in-chief at the Sun for 12 years and helped launched the Sun’s sister publication, the Ottawa Sun, in the late 1980s.
The Toronto Sun covers national news, politics, entertainment, sports, and life. The Sun’s sports coverage is typically from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and they also publish a daily [Sunshine Girl](https://torontosun.com/category/sunshine-girls), similar to British Tabloids.

Funded by / Ownership
The Toronto Sun is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees.
[Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his involvement in hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a
[downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Toronto Sun reports news with emotionally loaded words and right-leaning bias, such as
[“Trudeau blunders will sink one-term wonder boy.”](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/marin-trudeau-blunders-will-sink-one-term-wonder-boy) The Sun also publishes bikini news such as [“Will ‘duct-tape’ bikinis make a splash at the beach?”](https://torontosun.com/life/fashion-beauty/will-duct-tape-bikinis-make-a-splash-at-the-beach/wcm/636d7f31-07c8-443c-9ee8-e1f69401614d) and their daily [Sunshine Girls](https://torontosun.com/sunshine-girls/top-sunshine-girls-who-were-the-most-popular-models-in-november) section, which is adapted from [British tabloids.](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/01/20/end-of-an-era-uk-sun-drops-topless-page-3-girls.html)
The Sun re-publishes articles from credible sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/); however, they poorly source their news. When they do, they utilize their sister publications, such as the [Calgary Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/calgary-sun/), and rarely use hyperlinks.
Editorially, CEO Paul Godfrey ordered all 16 major Postmedia papers, including the Toronto Sun, to
[endorse](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/11/09/postmedia-let-down-readers-by-dictating-election-endorsements-honderich.html) Stephen Harper of the Conservative Party in the 2015 federal elections. Further, when it comes to opinion pieces on science, The Sun [casts doubt](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/oliver-climate-alarmism-lurks-behind-covid-19) on human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).
