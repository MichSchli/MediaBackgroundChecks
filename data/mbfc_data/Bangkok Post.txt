Analysis / Bias
The Bangkok Post covers the world and local news, business, and opinion reporting. Articles and heading do not use loaded language such as this
[Three EOD squad members blown up defusing militant bomb](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2258907/three-eod-squad-members-blown-up-defusing-militant-bomb). This story, like many others, only references the Bangkok Post as a source. World News is republished from other sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/).
Media censorship is prevalent in Thailand, which results in the Bangkok Post not covering the full story, especially when it relates to criticism of the Thai Royal Family and the government. As a result, they report favorably on the right-wing populist ruling party Palang Pracharath Party. This creates a right-leaning bias in the promotion of pro-government propaganda.
