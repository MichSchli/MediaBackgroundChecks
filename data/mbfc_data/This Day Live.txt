Analysis / Bias
This Day Live covers a wide variety of news, with local news reporting being low-biased, such as this
[Rivers Attorney General, Adangor Resigns](https://thisdaylive.com/index.php/2023/12/14/rivers-attorney-general-adangor-resigns). This story, like most reviewed, does not rely on hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, the paper favors right-leaning President Bola Tinuba with articles such as this
[BOLA TINUBU’S RENEWED HOPE 2023](https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2022/10/26/bola-tinubus-renewed-hope-2023) and [Our Challenges Present Opportunity to Innovate, Grow](https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2023/12/10/tinubu-our-challenges-present-opportunity-to-innovate-grow). This last article suggests that Tinubu has a profound understanding of political economy and describes his economic plan as a progressive policy platform that could lead Nigeria back to economic development. In general, This Day Live holds slight right-leaning biases and is mostly fact-based due to a lack of sourcing.
