Analysis / Bias
In the context of media freedom, Turkey, where TRT Afrika is based, ranks low globally, as highlighted by
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/).
TRT Afrika, focusing primarily on African news, exhibits a straightforward reporting style in its international coverage, with minimal sensationalism or biased language, such as this

However, the broader TRT network, to which TRT Afrika belongs, has been noted for its
[pro-government stance in Turkish national news](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trt-world/), suggesting a potential bias in how national issues might be covered. While TRT Afrika’s content on African and international news appears relatively unbiased, the site’s lack of transparency in sourcing and the overarching influence of TRT’s editorial practices in Turkey indicate a need for caution. Readers should be aware of these factors when evaluating the credibility and bias of the content, especially regarding Turkish political news.
