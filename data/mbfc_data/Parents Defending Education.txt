The organization emphasizes the role of parents as the primary custodians and authorities of their children.

Funded by / Ownership

Analysis / Bias
The website features an “Indoctrination Map” that lists perceived indoctrination incidents at schools around the country. When you click on the map, you are brought to a news story that describes the incident, such as this
[Pitt County Schools classroom lesson describes Democrats as “blue collar” and “secular” and Republicans as “white collar” and “religious.”](https://defendinged.org/incidents/pitt-county-schools-classroom-lesson-mentions-gender-ideology-appears-to-push-students-in-how-to-believe-regarding-political-issues/) This story is sourced from a political lesson quiz, presumably from the school.
Under the investigations section, they provide stories such as this
[List of School District Transgender – Gender Nonconforming Student Policies](https://defendinged.org/investigations/list-of-school-district-transgender-gender-nonconforming-student-policies/) and [‘Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action’ lesson plans feature Drag Queen Story Hour for elementary students and a “privileged or oppressed?” worksheet for middle schoolers](https://defendinged.org/investigations/black-lives-matter-at-school-week-of-action-lesson-plans-feature-drag-queen-story-hour-for-elementary-students-and-a-privileged-or-oppressed-worksheet-for-middle-schoolers/). This last story is reasonably sourced from the advocacy group [Black Lives Matter at School](https://www.blacklivesmatteratschool.com/).
Editorially, most information favors a conservative perspective through opposition to the teaching of Critical Race Theory, Black Lives Matter, and general anti-racist teachings that they view as indoctrination. Further, news stories often portray Republicans/Conservatives as victims through indoctrination like this
[Buffalo Public Schools uses 1619 Project as part of the curriculum; teaches students that Republicans used voter ID requirements to target black voters](https://defendinged.org/incidents/buffalo-public-schools-uses-1619-project-as-part-of-the-curriculum-teaches-students-that-republicans-used-voter-id-requirements-to-target-black-voters/). Finally, Parents Defending Education relies on a variety of sources; however, many are on our Questionable list, such as [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), and [The Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/).
