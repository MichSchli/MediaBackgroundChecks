Analysis / Bias
In review, Vaccine Impact publishes health-related news stories that they state are alternative. Our analysis concurs that they are certainly an alternative to conventional science and medicine. They are fiercely anti-vaccine with articles such as this:
[Vaccine Awareness Week: Fighting the Vaccine Culture War and Opposing Mandatory Vaccines](https://vaccineimpact.com/2017/vaccine-awareness-week-fighting-the-vaccine-culture-war-and-opposing-mandatory-vaccines/). They also promote misinformation regarding Covid-19, such as this [California ER Physicians: Sheltering in Place Does More Harm than Good – Lowers Our Immune System](https://vaccineimpact.com/2020/california-er-physicians-sheltering-in-place-does-more-harm-than-good-lowers-our-immune-system/). In general, this is an [anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) website that the discredited [Health Impact News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-impact-news/) owns.
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Vaccine Impact published false and misleading claims.
