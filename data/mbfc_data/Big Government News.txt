Analysis / Bias
In review, Mike Adams is known as the
[Health Ranger](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/NaturalNews), according to [Rationalwiki](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rationalwiki/). However, they point out dozens of cases where his claims are false. Besides promoting pseudoscience, Big Government News is an extreme right-wing biased source that frequently promotes Donald Trump propaganda such as these: [Secret trials, secret witnesses, secret proceedings… “impeachment,” nothing but a deep state kangaroo court like you’d see in a Third World country](https://biggovernment.news/2019-10-14-impeachment-deep-state-kangaroo-court-third-world.html). This article is sourced to the highly questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and has failed numerous fact checks. In this conspiracy story, there is zero evidence. Hence, it is a conspiracy: [Death camps, mass starvation, and forced obedience to govt may follow open borders, free health care for illegals & the total destruction of the US Constitution if Democrats win in 2020](https://biggovernment.news/2019-10-14-total-destruction-of-the-us-constitution-if-democrats-win-in-2020.html).
In general, politically, all of Mike Adam’s stories favor the right and promote pseudoscience such as
[chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), the Sandy Hook shooting being a false flag: [Sandy Hook was theater! Actor who played law enforcement sniper was recorded walking around carrying rifle by the magazine](https://www.newstarget.com/2016-07-07-sandy-hook-was-theater-actor-who-played-law-enforcement-sniper-was-recorded-walking-around-carrying-rifle-by-the-magazine.html). Further, they routinely publish [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and conspiracy theories. Lastly, this source denies the consensus on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) without evidence, as seen here: [Climate change cultists are now taking over your local weather forecast.](https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-05-09-climate-change-cultists-are-now-taking-over-your-local-weather-forecast.html)
