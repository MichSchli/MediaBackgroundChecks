Analysis / Bias
Immunity Journal is a hybrid (some open-access) journal that publishes information and research on the immune system. The journal primarily publishes research such as this:
[Single-cell protein expression profiling resolves circulating and resident memory T cell diversity across tissues and infection contexts](https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(23)00262-5).
Cell Press is an open-access/hybrid publisher of scientific journals. There are two types of Open Access Journals, legitimate and predatory, both of which charge the author for publication.
[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Immunity Journal is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, Cell Press has been criticized for [retracting some studies.](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cell/)
Although Cell Press has retracted some studies in other publications, Immunity Journal publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
