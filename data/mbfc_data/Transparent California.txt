History
[Founded in 2012](https://whois.domaintools.com/transparentcalifornia.com) by Robert Fellner, Transparent California claims to be the largest public pay and pension database for California. According to their [about page](https://transparentcalifornia.com/pages/about/) “Transparent California is provided by the [Nevada Policy Research Institute](http://npri.org/) as a public service and is dedicated to providing accurate, comprehensive and easily searchable information on the compensation of public employees in California.”
Robert Fellner writes for the Libertarian-leaning
[Mises Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/), which has been labeled factually mixed due to the promotion of pseudoscience. According to his [Mises profile](https://mises.org/profile/robert-fellner), he has been “published in the [Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/las-vegas-review-journal/), the [Los Angeles Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), the [Los Angeles Daily News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/los-angeles-daily-news/), the [Providence Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-providence-journal/), the [San Diego Union-Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-diego-union-tribune/), the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), and on the [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) and [RealClearPolicy websites](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/). He typically writes for right-leaning publications. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Nevada Policy Research Institute publishes Transparent California. According to their
[website](https://www.npri.org/about/), “The Nevada Policy Research Institute fights for your personal right to be free from the constraints and abuses of an ever-growing crony government, by conducting fact-based research and grassroots education that holds government accountable and transparent to the very people it is designed to serve.” NPRI is an IRS 501(c) (3) organization funded through donations from individuals, corporations, foundations, and family trusts. Ironically, the NPRI website and hence Transparent California lacks transparency as they do not disclose funders. The left-leaning [Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/) details how they are funded.
