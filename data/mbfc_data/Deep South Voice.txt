Analysis / Bias
In review, Deep South Voice reports a mix of original content and republished stories that primarily focus on Mississippi politics. Story selection always favors the left and often uses moderate loaded emotional language in headlines such as this:
[While Kids Died at Saugus High, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith Blocked Background Check Bill](https://deepsouthvoice.com/index.php/2019/11/14/while-kids-died-at-saugus-high-senator-cindy-hyde-smith-blocked-background-check-bill). This story’s only source is a tweet. In another story “ [Republican Who Argued for Tossing Out Black Votes Wins Job Overseeing Mississippi Elections”](https://deepsouthvoice.com/index.php/2019/11/05/republican-who-argued-for-tossing-out-black-votes-wins-position-as-top-mississippi-election-official), there isn’t any sourcing at all. The stories that do offer sourcing often link to credible outlets such as the [Jackson Free Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jackson-free-press/) and .gov sites.
Editorially, the Deep South Voice endorses Democratic candidates in Mississippi such as this:
[Mike Espy Kicks Off 2020 U.S. Senate Campaign Against Hyde-Smith: ‘This Time, We’ll Win’](https://deepsouthvoice.com/index.php/2019/11/12/mike-espy-kicks-off-2020-u-s-senate-campaign-against-hyde-smith-this-time-well-win). They also frequently report negatively on conservatives and President Trump such as this: [Trump Embraces Pat Buchanan, Who He Once Called “A Hitler Lover”](https://deepsouthvoice.com/index.php/2019/01/14/trump-embraces-pat-buchanan-who-he-once-called-a-hitler-lover). In general, Deep South Voice reports factual information with a consistent left wing bias in story selection and wording.
