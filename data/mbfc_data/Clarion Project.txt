Analysis / Bias
In review, The Clarion Project produces films that have been described as
[anti-Islamic propaganda](https://web.archive.org/web/20170531123019/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/01/iranium.html). The website features a [map](https://clarionproject.org/extremist-organization/) that lists extremist groups in each state. The map only provides what they perceive as Islamic Extremist and do not include such organizations as the KKK or other right-wing extremist groups. The Clarion Project also offers a news section that provides commentary and analysis from a right-leaning perspective. Articles and headlines utilize moderately loaded language that is derogatory toward Muslims: [Is Muslim Reform Even Possible?](https://clarionproject.org/is-muslim-reform-even-possible/) When it comes to sourcing, they rely on a mix of credible sources and poor sources such as [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) and [Jihad Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jihad-watch-correction/).
