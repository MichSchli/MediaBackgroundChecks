The website lacks transparency as they do not openly disclose ownership. An online shop that sells products and merchandise generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Eluxe Magazine publishes plenty of legitimate articles pertaining to natural products and health news. However, we found examples of Eluxe promoting conspiracies and pseudoscience in reviewing the website. In one article, they
[report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) on the [dangers of Chemtrails](https://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/dangers-of-chemtrails/) sourced from [Geoengineering Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geoengineering-watch/), which we have rated as Tin-Foil Hat on the conspiracy scale.
In another article, they promote anti-vaccination propaganda while sourcing from the pseudoscience websites of
[Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) and [Collective-Evolution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/collective-evolution/). Finally, they also [promote](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) [anti-GMO propaganda](https://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/omg-gmo-trees-are-coming/) that Joseph Mercola writes. Again, Eluxe Magazine does produce a lot of beneficial and accurate information; however, due to publishing some questionable information, we rate them strong for both Conspiracy and Pseudoscience.
