[live cameras](https://www.borderreport.com/live-cameras/) pointing at sections of the border wall. BorderReport breaks the news down by geography such as California, Texas, Arizona, etc., and by hot topics such as immigration, migrant centers, the border wall, and border crime.

Articles and headlines are presented with minimal bias in wording and editorializing, such as this
[DHS rolls out new Alternatives to Detention pilot program with expanded migrant services](https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/immigration/dhs-rolls-out-new-alternatives-to-detention-pilot-program-with-expanded-migrant-services/).
