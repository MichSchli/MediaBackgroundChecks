History
[Founded in 2017](https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/bitchute/) by Ray Vahey, BitChute is an online video hosting platform that publishes far-right conspiracy theories and videos banned by Youtube for content violations. Some notable publishers on BitChute are conspiracy theorists [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and [Lauren Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Southern). The website lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page, and anybody uploads videos. They claim to use a peer-to-peer network to prevent censorship.

Funded by / Ownership
Bit Chute Limited owns the website, with revenue derived through membership sales and donations. Virtually all payment processors such as
[Paypal](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/14/bitchute-youtube-alternative-cries-foul-over-appar/) have banned BitChute, and advertisers have rejected them due to offensive content.
Analysis / Bias
In review, BitChute publishes user-uploaded videos that often contain extreme, misleading, or fake far-right content. For example, they publish videos from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones such as this
[UN Propaganda Prepares Pacific Islanders For The Rise of the New World Order](https://www.bitchute.com/video/MBiSrQjlyFl1/). Based on the content’s offensive and often false nature, we will not provide more hyperlinks to their website. They generally promote illegal content and hate speech that has been banned from other services. Other topics frequently found on the website are neo-Nazism, white supremacy, Qanon conspiracies, and pro-Trump propaganda.
According to the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/01/11/problem-epik-proportions), “BitChute, is a low-rent YouTube clone that carries an array of hate-fueled material, including white nationalist podcasts, propaganda linked to a murderous neo-Nazi group, and a parody song called “N—– Babies,” which chortles at the idea of slaughtering and then eating black infants.” Further, during the Coronavirus pandemic, they have frequently published disinformation, such as the banned video [Plandemic](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/plandemic-recirculates-after-platforms-say-they-took-it-down/), riddled with false claims. In general, this is a website that offers disinformation and offensive content. Put another way, it is the 4-Chan or 8-Chan of video. It is not credible on any level.
