[USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), owns The Herald News. In August 2019, [Gatehouse Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/08/06/gatehouse-gannett-to-merge-for-1-4b-build-newspaper-giant/) purchased and merged with Gannett becoming the largest newspaper chain in the USA. After the merger, the companies retained the Gannett name. Advertising and paid subscriptions generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Herald News covers local news through original reporting by journalists and with minimal bias, such as this:
[Pilgrim nuclear power plant workers prep for shutdown after 47 years](https://www.heraldnews.com/news/20190529/pilgrim-nuclear-power-plant-workers-prep-for-shutdown-after-47-years). National News is primarily derived from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) as well as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and other Gannett publications.
Editorially, the paper tends to cover both sides without any evidence of extremism; however, more op-eds tend to slightly favor the left. The paper has not recently endorsed Presidential candidates. In general, The Herald News reports news with minimal bias, and editorials are reasonably balanced.
