Analysis
In review, Quillette is a right-leaning blog that features lengthy, well-written articles. Headlines occasionally utilize loaded language such as this:
[Cowardice at Columbia](https://quillette.com/2019/04/19/cowardice-at-columbia/). This story is also properly sourced to credible local media and provides video evidence. In another article, [Jordan Peterson, And the New Chivalry](https://quillette.com/2019/04/12/jordan-peterson-and-the-new-chivalry/), they [report favorably](https://quillette.com/2017/12/01/defence-jordan-b-peterson/) on Jordan Peterson, who has made several anti-feminist statements and has called for “ [enforced monogamy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html),” and “The people who hold that our culture is an oppressive patriarchy, they don’t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.”
Editor-in-Chief and Founder Claire Lehmann are considered a part of the
[Intellectual Dark Web](https://intellectualdarkweb.site/vanguards-of-the-intellectual-dark-web/), a term used to [describe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_dark_web) a “group of public personalities who oppose what they see as the dominance of progressive identity politics and political correctness in the media and academia.” The primary mission of the IDW is to reject political correctness and embrace a free-thinking discussion of controversial topics. Further, [according](https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/05/14/conservatives-cheer-the-latest-right-wing-supergroup-the-intellectual-dark-web/) to the left-leaning [Village Voice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-village-voice/), Claire Lehmann, believes “ [nationalism is the antidote to racism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpmoAnvnbTw)” and [claims to have been “blacklisted” for “criticizing feminism”.](https://twitter.com/zei_nabq/status/985960593705365504)
Bias
In general, Quillette promotes right-leaning positions such as
[anti-feminism](https://quillette.com/2018/01/02/no-one-cares-feminist-theory/) and questionable viewpoints regarding racism. For example, in this [article](https://quillette.com/2019/01/25/how-real-is-systemic-racism-today/), they state, “Racist attitudes of whites towards blacks have long become socially unacceptable in America, although the reverse, racism of a minority directed at the white majority, is still tolerated or even encouraged.”
Reverse racism is controversial and disputed by some. It is certainly possible for minorities to be prejudiced against Whites; however, some believe racism
[requires](https://quillette.com/2019/01/25/how-real-is-systemic-racism-today/) “systematic oppression built into the government, institutions and social structures. Without this factor of systematic oppression, there cannot be racism.” This article also talks at length about IQ differences between whites and blacks and, while not definitively stating it, repeats over and over that genetics are a factor in racial IQ differences (hereditarianism, which is a pseudoscientific viewpoint).
Further, on May 29, 2019,
[Quillette published](http://archive.is/fQMWj#selection-313.0-313.12) an article by [Eoin Lenihan](https://archive.is/o/fQMWj/https://quillette.com/author/eoin-lenihan/), claiming “connections between anti-fascist activists and national-level reporters who cover the far-right.” [According](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/quillette-antifa-journalist-smear-campaign.php) to [Columbia Journalism Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-journalism-review/), Lenihan “identified himself as an online extremism researcher, despite having no association with any previously known organization that researches extremism. In reality, Lenihan was already an established right-wing troll, now blanket banned for ‘violating rules against managing multiple Twitter accounts for abusive purposes.’” When asked by CJR if the information contained in the story was fact-checked, Quillette declined to comment.
