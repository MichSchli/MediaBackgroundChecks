History
[Founded in 2018](https://whois.domaintools.com/electroverse.net), Electroverse is a news and opinion website that promotes human-influenced climate change denial. The website completely lacks transparency as there is not an about page, the contact page does not provide the location, the only author named is Cap Allon, who does not provide a biography, and ownership is not disclosed.
According to their
[Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/electroverse), “Electroverse has been set up to wade against the mainstream propaganda and accurately document Earth Changes as two world-altering climatic events unfold simultaneously.”
Funded by / Ownership
Electroverse does not disclose ownership; however, it is assumed to be owned by Cap Allon. A search for Cap Allon does not verify if this is a real name. Revenue is derived through a donation to a Patreon account.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Electroverse offers the tagline “DOCUMENTING EARTH CHANGES DURING THE NEXT GSM AND POLE SHIFT.” All stories published are from the same person named Cap Allon, in which we do not know his credentials as it relates to
[climate science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). The premise of the website is that humans do not influence climate change.
The author uses fallacious (strawman) arguments such as frequently pointing out regional cold spells as a way to refute global warming such as this
[JUST COUNT THE COLD-RECORDS THAT FELL OVER THE PAST 24HRS](https://electroverse.net/just-count-the-cold-records-that-have-fallen-over-the-past-24hrs/). Regional cold snaps have [nothing](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/01/climate-change-colder-winters-global-warming-polar-vortex/) to do with global warming. The website also promotes the Solar Minimum as a cause for the upcoming cooler weather in the late 2020s, which has merit, but does not negate global warming [GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM AND THE SWING BETWEEN EXTREMES](https://electroverse.net/grand-solar-minimum-and-the-swing-between-extremes/). Another fallacy (cherry-picking) deployed by this website is to quote scientists from 50 years ago to prove they were wrong about their predictions. This is a poor argument as science evolves and changes with new information. What we know today is far more accurate than what we knew in 1972: [NASA (EARLY 1970S): “CO2 WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE 10 TIMES TO ACHIEVE A 2.5-DEGREE RISE IN TEMPERATURE”](https://electroverse.net/nasa-co2-would-have-to-increase-10-times-to-achieve-a-2-5-degree-rise-in-temp/). Please see [NASA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nasa/) for [current information](https://climate.nasa.gov/) on climate change. In general, Electroverse publishes misinformation regarding climate change that does not align with the consensus of science.
