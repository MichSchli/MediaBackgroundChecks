Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is reported by journalists on the ground and national news through a combination of local journalists and large national sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). There is minimal use of loaded language and all information is properly sourced. Editorially, there is a reasonable balance of right and left views, with perhaps a small favoring to the right. A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=daily%20journal%20illinois&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals the Daily Journal has never failed a fact check.
