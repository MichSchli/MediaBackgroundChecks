History
Founded in 2020 by Mark Slapinski, Toronto Today is a news and opinion website that has published fake news. According to their
[about page](https://www.torontotoday.net/about-us/) “Toronto Today tells you what biased, corporate media won’t. Working-class, Indigenous, and African-Canadian people are underserved by the media. Let’s change that. Those in positions of authority and those that work in the mainstream media need to stop lying.” [Read our profile on Canadian media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canada-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Toronto Today reports news with sensational headlines such as this
[Is Trudeau the Worst Prime Minister? According to many, yes](https://www.torontotoday.net/2020/08/15/is-trudeau-the-worst-prime-minister-according-to-many-yes/). While this article is clearly against the left-leaning Trudeau, they also appear to support the left with articles such as this [BLM protesters attacked by hockey-stick wielding racist in Winnipeg.](https://www.torontotoday.net/2020/07/05/blm-protesters-attacked-by-hockey-stick-wielding-racist-in-winnipeg/) This story is sourced to tweets. In another story, which appears on our failed fact checks list, they claim that Vladimir Putin’s daughter died due to taking a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The sources for this story are unnamed sources within the Kremlin and a Tarot Card Reading from Youtube. In general, information is poorly sourced and may have a left-leaning bias, but it is hard to determine based on the routine publication of fake news.
