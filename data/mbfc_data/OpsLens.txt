Analysis / Bias
The contributors to the website are all former intelligence or military people with a strong right-wing bias in story selection. This source is also highly pro-Trump in reporting. OpsLens republishes stories from
[far-right sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lifezette/) such as [LifeZette](http://www.opslens.com/2017/05/31/white-house-readies-total-war-fake-news-media/), which offers low credibility for factual reporting. Besides publishing biased news stories, OpsLens also has an online store that sells pro-Trump T-shirts and accessories. OpsLens does not use excessive loaded words but often links to far-right and mixed sources for factual reporting, such as [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/) and [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/).
Since our original review in 2017, they have promoted election fraud conspiracies such as this
[GA’s SoS Raffensperger Gave Hackers Roadmap To Infiltrate Machines A Year Before Election](https://opslens.com/gas-sos-raffensperger-gave-hackers-roadmap-to-infiltrate-machines-a-year-before-election/). They have also promoted Covid-19 misinformation such as this [IO Episode 51 – Interview With Dr. Peter McCullough On The ‘Vaccines’](https://opslens.com/io-episode-51-interview-with-dr-peter-mccullough-on-the-vaccines/). Peter McCullough has made [numerous false claims](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/vaccines-are-a-safer-alternative-for-acquiring-immunity-compared-to-natural-infection-and-covid-19-survivors-benefit-from-getting-vaccinated-contrary-to-claims-by-peter-mccullough/) about vaccines and is not considered a credible source by his peers in the field.
Failed Fact Checks
- Third parties have not directly fact-checked them. See above.
Overall, this is a very attractive and professional-looking website that can be misleading as its content is far-right biased and often poorly sourced. Therefore we rate OpsLens as mixed for factual reporting with a strong right-wing bias that is borderline questionable. (M. Huitsing 8/24/2017) Updated (10/07/2022)
