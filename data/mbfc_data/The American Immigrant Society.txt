Analysis / Bias
The content and activities of AIS strongly emphasize a positive view of immigration and its role in American society. The narrative is consistently pro-immigrant, focusing on the
[contributions of immigrants](https://www.americanimmigrantsociety.org/our-message.html) to the U.S. This perspective aligns with a pro-immigrant, left-leaning bias, emphasizing diversity, multiculturalism, and the benefits of immigration.
Key points from the AIS content suggest a narrative that counters anti-immigrant sentiments and highlights the historical significance of immigration in the U.S. The organization’s digital efforts and events aim to foster a supportive community for immigrants and promote understanding among the general public. Using
[immigrant stories](https://www.americanimmigrantsociety.org/upload-your-own-story.html) and historical references humanizes and contextualizes the immigrant experience, countering stereotypes and misinformation.
The mention of a series like
[“Enrique’s Journey”](https://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-fg-enriques-journey-sg-storygallery.html) in the [Los Angeles Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) further indicates a focus on personal, empathetic narratives that challenge readers’ perceptions of immigration.
In general, The American Immigrant Society exhibits a clear pro-immigrant stance, emphasizing the positive aspects of immigration in America. Its approach is educational and advocacy-based, using digital platforms and storytelling to promote its message. This bias is consistent with organizations focused on immigrant rights and advocacy, and it provides a counter-narrative to anti-immigrant sentiments prevalent in certain segments of the media and political discourse.
Despite the presence of board members like
[Dr. Mehmet Oz](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/dr-oz-claims-that-eating-classified-documents-was-essential-to-trumps-healthy-diet) with known right-leaning political affiliations, the American Immigrant Society’s messaging, which emphasizes the positive contributions of immigrants to the U.S., can be perceived as leaning towards the left in the current political context. However, based on the available information, including the year-old updates on their [ X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/iam1immigrant?lang=en) account and the lack of recent event details on their website, it is not clear if the American Immigrant Society is currently active in hosting events or engaging in other activities.
