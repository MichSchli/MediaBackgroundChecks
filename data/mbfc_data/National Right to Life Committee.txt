Analysis / Bias
In review, the National Right to Life Committee primarily reports on anti-abortion and pro-Evangelical Christian issues such as euthanasia and assisted suicide. Editorially, they support Republicans and oppose Democrats
[“Democrats Unapologetically Advocate for Abortion up until Birth and beyond](http://www.nrlpac.org/). They also [fund](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pac2pac.php?cycle=2020&cmte=C00111278) “Texans for Ronny Jackson” (Ronny L. Jackson is a former White House physician running for Congress as a Republican in Texas). When reporting on the issues, they are passionate about; they utilize factually mixed sources such as [first things](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/first-things-magazine/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/).
The website also provides a link to their news website called
[NRL News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nrl-news-today/), which strongly endorses President Trump, such as this [A glorious day to remember: November 8, 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/2019/11/a-glorious-day-to-remember-november-8-2016-when-donald-trump-was-elected-president/). Read our dedicated review of NRL News. In general, they advocate for anti-abortion legislation and a pro-conservative agenda while sometimes publishing false information, as seen below.
