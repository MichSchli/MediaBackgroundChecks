Analysis / Bias
Latin Times covers news for a Latin American audience. Almost all stories include videos from credible local news outlets such as this
[Homeless Man Named Moses Confesses To Murdering 67-Year-Old Roommate In Brooklyn](https://www.latintimes.com/homeless-man-named-moses-confesses-murdering-67-year-old-roommate-brooklyn-477199). This story is properly sourced.
Editorially, there is a mix of stories and no op-eds published; however, more stories favor the left overall. The Latin Times is left-leaning and factual based on proper sourcing of information to local outlets.
