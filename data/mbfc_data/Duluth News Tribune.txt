Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered via journalists, while national/international news is derived from outside sources such as the
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). There is minimal use of biased language in straight news reporting. Editorially, the Duluth News Tribune leans right in opinion and editorial content. Up until the 2016 election, the DNT has always [endorsed Republican Presidential candidates](http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/4142665-non-endorsement-time-president-none-above). In 2018, they endorsed [slightly more Democratic candidates](https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/4520512-our-picks-election-endorsements) for local seats. There is also use of loaded emotional language in opinion pieces such as this: [Immigrant-bashing began with Founding Fathers — not with Trump](https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/columns/4524793-local-view-immigrant-bashing-began-founding-fathers-not-trump).
In general, editorials are reasonably balanced with a mix of right-center and left-center opinions.
