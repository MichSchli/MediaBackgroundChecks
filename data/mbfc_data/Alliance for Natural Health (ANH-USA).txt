History
Founded in 1992, The Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH-USA), formerly known as the American Association for Health Freedom, is a 501(c)4 nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting
[alternative medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) and is associated with the libertarian [health freedom movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_freedom). According to their [about page](https://anh-usa.org/about/who-we-are/), “The Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH-USA) is the largest organization in the US and abroad working to protect your right to utilize safe, effective, and inexpensive healing therapies based on high-tech testing, diet, supplements, and lifestyle changes. We believe a system that is single-mindedly focused on “treating” sick people with expensive drugs, rather than maintaining healthy people, is neither practical nor economically sustainable.”
ANH-USA has been a plaintiff in several significant lawsuits against the
[Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) related to suppressing health claims for dietary supplements. You can view a list of their accomplishments [here](https://anh-usa.org/accomplishments/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, ANH-USA lobbies the government, files lawsuits, and comments on proposed rulings on behalf of consumers, medical practitioners, and companies in the natural health industry. The website also provides news and information related to holistic medicine and the health industry, with articles that are fiercely against FDA, such as this
[FDA Allows Carcinogens In Popular Drugs](https://anh-usa.org/fda-allows-carcinogens-in-popular-drugs/). ANH is [opposed to GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and utilizes loaded emotional headlines to validate their position: [Want Holes in Your Stomach? Eat More GMOs](https://anh-usa.org/want-holes-in-your-stomach-eat-more-gmos/). This has been [debunked](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/will-gmos-hurt-my-body/) as junk science. ANH also promotes [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and conspiracy theories such as this: [Autism-Vaccine Cover-up Snowballs as Whistleblower’s Identity is Revealed—LATEST UPDATES](https://anh-usa.org/autism-vaccine-cover-up-latest-updates/). At this time, the consensus of science indicates there is not a link between [Autism and Vaccines](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). Finally, during the Coronavirus pandemic, they have frequently [promoted misinformation](https://anh-usa.org/covid/).
