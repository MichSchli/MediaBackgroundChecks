History
[Founded in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PragerU) by Dennis Prager and Allen Astrin, PragerU, short for Prager University, is a non-profit organization that creates videos on various political, economic, and philosophical topics from a conservative or right-wing perspective. PragerU is not an academic institution. It is strictly a conservative [Youtube video channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWlSUNDvCCS1hBiXV0zKcA) and news website. The following disclaimer is located at the bottom of the website: PRAGER UNIVERSITY IS NOT AN ACCREDITED ACADEMIC INSTITUTION AND DOES NOT OFFER CERTIFICATIONS OR DIPLOMAS. BUT IT IS A PLACE WHERE YOU ARE FREE TO LEARN.
Dennis Prager is a Neoconservative radio host and columnist for the far-right and questionable
[WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/). Prager believes that Christianity is under threat from secular leftist universities and therefore created PragerU to counteract them. PragerU has developed [two partnership programs](https://rewire.news/article/2015/04/30/conservatives-spend-millions-proselytizing-school-children/) to help cultivate relationships with educators. PragerU’s Educator Program supplies teachers with lesson plans and study guides accompanying their videos. Additionally, secondary school teachers and college professors can register for their classes through PragerU’s Academic Partnership program, which lets students sign up and allows teachers to monitor their students’ progress.

Funded by / Ownership
PragerU is a non-profit
[funded by donors](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/prager-university) such as hydraulic fracturing billionaires [Dan and Farris Wilks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_and_Farris_Wilks) and the [Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynde_and_Harry_Bradley_Foundation), advocating for low immigration and human-influenced [climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Other large donors all hold conservative views as well. The organization has a $10 million annual budget, of which it spends more than 40% on marketing.
Analysis / Bias
In review, PragerU publishes well-produced videos that appeal to a conservative audience. The most frequent topics covered are
[anti-immigration](https://www.prageru.com/video/illegal-immigration-its-about-power/), [human-influenced climate change denialism](https://www.prageru.com/video/what-they-havent-told-you-about-climate-change/), [Pro-Christian](https://www.prageru.com/video/the-worlds-most-persecuted-minority-christians/) and [anti-Muslim](https://www.prageru.com/video/radical-islam-the-most-dangerous-ideology/) themes, advocacy for free-market capitalism, and [harsh criticism of socialism](https://www.prageru.com/video/democratic-socialism-is-still-socialism/). Further, there are many videos in support of [President Trump.](https://www.prageru.com/video/democratic-socialism-is-still-socialism/) Most videos are less than 5 minutes and come from prominent conservatives like Dennis Prager. Some have very poor track records with fact-checkers such as [Tucker Carlson Bias Rating](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/)Tucker Carlson, Michelle Malkin (Anti-Islam), and [Steven Crowder](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/louder-with-crowder/). Further, the right-leaning [Cato Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/) has [criticized PragerU](https://www.cato.org/blog/pragerus-nation-immigrants-video-has-serious-problems) for publishing misleading and false information regarding immigration. In general, all videos favor the right and denigrate the left using poor sources.
The website also contains an “In The News” section which curates news from other sources such as the
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and [Forbes.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) However, they also list stories from far-right biased sources and questionable ones such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/), and [FrontPage Mag](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontpage-magazine/). All news stories are related in some way to PragerU, such as this: [The Southern Poverty Law Center’s Smear Campaign Against PragerU](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/06/19/splc-smear-campaign-against-prageru/). This particular story is a reaction to the [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/07/prageru%E2%80%99s-influence) calling PragerU an “indispensable propaganda device for the right.” They further state, “PragerU seems to be yet another node on the internet connecting conservative media consumers to the dark corners of the extreme right.”
In general, PragerU frequently promotes misinformation related to Climate Change, Race, and Covid-19. (See failed fact checks below)
