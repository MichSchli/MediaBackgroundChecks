Analysis / Bias
In review, MeidasTouch mainly releases viral
[ads](https://www.dailykos.com/tags/MeidasTouch) criticizing Donald Trump and his administration. For example, an ad was released on July 8, 2020, criticizing the President with a headline that reads [“Creepy Trump”](https://www.meidastouch.com/post/creepy-trump) and another ad with the headline [‘Trump Emptied Stadiums](https://www.meidastouch.com/post/exclusive-new-video-meidastouch-presents-trump-emptied-stadiums).’ A strongly emotional quote from the text summary of the “Creepy Trump” video reads, “Donald Trump is a disgusting and creepy individual whose predatory behavior is well-documented. Trump and his crumbling regime of scoundrels and liars seek to use the label on others, but there is no one creepier than Donald Trump.”
MeidasTouch also publishes essays such as
[“Trump’s Weakness: Narcissistic Personality Disorder.”](https://www.meidastouch.com/post/trump-s-weakness-narcissistic-personality-disorder) In this essay, they source credible media outlets such as the [Mayo Clinic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mayo-clinic/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Typically, they report on the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, and VP nominee Kamala Harris favorably, such as [here](https://www.meidastouch.com/post/exclusive-new-video-meidastouch-presents-prosecute-trump). Finally, MeidasTouch also [partners](https://www.meidastouch.com/post/vote-proud-partnership-lgbtq-enough-is-enough) with LGBTQ+ Political Org, where together they released the ad “Enough is Enough.” In general, MeidasTouch creates political ads with a strong left-leaning bias that negatively portrays Donald Trump. While the information presented is rooted in fact, utilizing Trump’s own words, it is often completely one-sided and misleading due to a lack of context.
