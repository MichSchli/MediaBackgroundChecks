Analysis / Bias
CyberScoop publishes articles that maintain a professional tone and rely on facts and expert opinions. For instance, in the article
[“A year after Russia’s invasion, the scope of cyberwar in Ukraine comes into focus](https://cyberscoop.com/ukraine-russia-cyberwar-anniversary/),” the reporting is balanced. The language used is neutral, such as “Russian cyberattacks have been less impactful than initially feared.” The article cites sources like sentinelone.com and [zdnet.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zdnet/).
Another article,
[“GitHub disables pro-Russian hacktivist DDoS pages,”](https://cyberscoop.com/russia-hacktivist-noname-github-ddos/) cites sources like cisa.gov and sentinelone.com and uses neutral words with phrases like “GitHub has disabled accounts belonging to a pro-Russian hacktivist group.” The article is well-sourced, referencing actions by GitHub and detailing the activities of the hacktivist group.
Finally, the articles are generally well-sourced, referencing cybersecurity experts, company spokespeople, and government officials. The language used in the articles is neutral, avoiding emotionally charged words or sensationalism, which indicates a low level of bias.
