Analysis / Bias
In review, Conscious Life news publishes news stories related to holistic healing,
[alternative medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/), and spiritual news. For example, they cover [chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), [astrology & numerology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/), [aliens](https://consciouslifenews.com/category/realtys-edge/ets-ufos-crop-circles/), and [cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/): [The Over-the-Counter Cancer Cure You’re Not Supposed to Know About](https://consciouslifenews.com/the-over-the-counter-cancer-cure-youre-not-supposed-to-know-about/11103623/). In general, this website promotes information that is considered pseudoscience by definition: According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on [Science and Pseudoscience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/?utm_source=instantmagazine&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=OImrt19), “Philosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their views on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in the community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of demarcation. There is a widespread agreement, for instance, that creationism, astrology, [homeopathy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-homeopathy/), Kirlian photography, dowsing, ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian catastrophism, and [climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) are pseudosciences.“
Politically, Conscious Life news favors the progressive left and denigrates the right, such as
