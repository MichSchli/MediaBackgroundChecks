History
Newsmax is an American conservative biased news and opinion website founded by Christopher Ruddy in 1998 and based in West Palm Beach, Florida. Christopher Ruddy is the president and CEO of Newsmax Media. According to an
[Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/how-chris-ruddy-became-the-medias-favorite-friend-of-trump/519168/), Ruddy is also a close friend of Donald Trump. The website is divided into four main sections: Newsmax, Newsmax Health, Newsmax Finance, and Newsmax World, divided into various subsections. Newsmax Media also [operates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax_Media) a print magazine called Newsmax and the cable news [channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax_TV) Newsmax TV.
On 4/30/2021, Newsmax
[apologized](https://newsfactsnetwork.com/2021/05/01/newsmax-apologizes-for-vote-manipulation-claims-against-dominion-leader/) to Dominion Voting Systems for claims that they manipulated voting machines and counts to thwart the re-election of President Donald Trump. The statement reads, “Newsmax has found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so,” it said in a statement. “Nor has Newsmax found any evidence that Dr. Coomer ever participated in any conversation with members of ‘Antifa,’ nor that he was directly involved with any partisan political organization.”
Through this apology, Dominion Voting Systems
[dropped](https://www.businessinsider.com/newsmax-settles-dominion-executive-eric-coomer-defamation-lawsuit-and-apologizes-2021-4) the defamation lawsuit against Newsmax. [On 10/20/2022](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-cbs-news-reporter-lara-182506452.html), Newsmax Banned Lara Logan from the network after promoting racist conspiracy theories and Qanon disinformation. The network states: “Newsmax condemns in the strongest terms the reprehensible statements made by Lara Logan, and her views do not reflect our network,” the network said in a statement. “We have no plans to interview her again.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Newsmax is owned by Christopher Ruddy, who is the CEO of Newsmax Media. Newsmax is funded through advertising and via a paid subscription to their platinum plan, allowing more access to content.
Analysis / Bias
Newsmax has a category on their sidebar called Around the Web, which is deceptive advertising. It looks like news links and leads to fake pseudo-science information and products. For example: “
[Suffer with Low Energy, Weight Gain & Fatigue](http://energyatanyage.com/)” leads to a new website promoting products. In another category called Specials, they publish news with sensational headlines resulting in headlines such as these: “Nobel Prize-Winning Discovery Makes Your Cells Nearly “Immortal” SPECIAL: New way to grow biologically younger,“ which again leads to an advertisement.
When reporting real news, Newsmax uses minimally loaded words in their headlines and articles such as “
[NYT: Growing Puerto Rican Population Could Offset GOP Cubans](http://www.newsmax.com/US/florida-puerto-ricans-cubans-voting/2017/10/06/id/818265/)” and moderately loaded: [“FEMA’s Long: No Time For San Juan Mayor’s ‘Political Noise](http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/brock-long-fema-working-puerto-rico-criticism/2017/10/08/id/818387/).’ Newsmax also aggregates news stories from credible sources such as [Reuters](http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/moscow-russia-media/2017/10/08/id/818386/) and the [AP](https://www.newsmax.com/US/US-Ivana-Trump-Book/2017/10/07/id/818302/). Newsmax holds a strong [right editorial bias](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sean-spicer-bias-rating/). The majority of editorials favor conservatives, such as “Could Google Lose the Left?” which [first appeared](https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/could-google-actually-lose-the-left) in the right-biased [Conservative Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-review/).
Newsmax does not always align with
[experts’ consensus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) in the given field when it comes to science. For example, they often promote “ [no global warming](https://www.newsmax.com/MKTNews/global-warming-hoax-facts/2014/10/17/id/601458/),” which is simply [untrue](https://climate.nasa.gov/). Further, they have promoted [misinformation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) regarding [vaccines’ safety](https://www.newsmax.com/health/dr-blaylock/flu-vaccine-pregnancy-inflammation-autism/2019/12/26/id/947420/), [chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), [CoronaVirus conspiracies](http://archive.is/JeuNY), and unproven [2020 election fraud disinformation](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/philadelphia-polling-violation/).
In general, Newsmax is not a credible source with a strong right-leaning editorial bias. They violate all basic journalistic standards for credibility and reliability.

We rate Newsmax Right Biased and Questionable based on the promotion of conspiracy theories and pseudoscience as well as numerous failed fact checks. (
