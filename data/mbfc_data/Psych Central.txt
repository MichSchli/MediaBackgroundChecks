Analysis / Bias
In review, Psych Central publishes information regarding a variety of psychological conditions as well as news related to psychology. For example, they provide information on
[ADHD](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/), [PTSD](https://psychcentral.com/ptsd/), [Schizophrenia,](https://psychcentral.com/schizophrenia/) [Addiction](https://psychcentral.com/addiction/), and many more. They also publish quizzes that can be used as an informal diagnosis, such as this: [Depression Test](https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/depression-quiz/). News articles are always properly sourced to credible media outlets or scientific journals and use minimally loaded language such as [Symptoms of Antisocial Personality Disorder in Children](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/childhood-behavioral/2019/12/symptoms-of-antisocial-personality-disorder-in-children/), and this [Study Finds Genetic Link Between Disorders](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/12/14/study-finds-genetic-link-between-disorders/).
Editorially, Psych Central presents with a left-leaning bias as they frequently analyze former President Trump’s personality and behavior, such as this:
[Donald Trump and the Narcissistic Illusion of Grandiosity](https://psychcentral.com/lib/donald-trump-and-the-narcissistic-illusion-of-grandiosity/). This story is well-sourced and evidence-based.
