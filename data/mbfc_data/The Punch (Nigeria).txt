Analysis / Bias
In review, The Punch reports news summaries and commentary on Nigerian and international news. Articles and headlines often contain minimally loaded emotional wording. Punch covers the center-right PDP and governing center-left party APC neutrally, such as here “
[My suspension by Delta PDP laughable, says Nwaoboshi”](https://punchng.com/my-suspension-by-delta-pdp-laughable-says-nwaoboshi/) and [“APC dismisses Obaseki’s sedition threat against 14 absentee lawmakers.”](https://punchng.com/apc-dismisses-obasekis-sedition-threat-against-14-absentee-lawmakers/) However, The Punch sources poorly, rarely using hyperlinks, and often utilizing quotes.
They also report on US politics neutrally. For example, their coverage of former Republican President Trump
[“US to place visa restriction on Nigeria, others”](https://punchng.com/us-to-place-visa-restriction-on-nigeria-others/) and current Democrat President Biden [“Human rights abuse, others may work against Nigeria under Biden – Ex-US envoy, others.”](https://punchng.com/human-rights-abuse-others-may-work-against-nigeria-under-biden-ex-us-envoy-others/) In general, story selection is balanced; however, a review of opinion pieces reveals a left-leaning editorial bias [Mr. President, there is hunger in the land!](https://punchng.com/mr-president-there-is-hunger-in-the-land/) And [Imperatives of realising education aspiration for Nigerian children](https://punchng.com/imperatives-of-realising-education-aspiration-for-nigerian-children/). Finally, the paper endorses [gender equality and concern for human-influenced climate change.](https://punchng.com/unveiling-national-action-plan-on-gender-and-climate-change/)
