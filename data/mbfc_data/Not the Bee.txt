Analysis / Bias
In review, Not the Bee publishes original stories from a right biased and often sarcastic perspective. Articles and headlines contain emotionally loaded language that often denigrates the left, such as this
[Nancy Pelosi, who is worth $114M and owns a $24,000 fridge, laments “the disparities in income and equity in our country](https://notthebee.com/article/nancy-pelosi-who-is-worth-114m-and-owns-a-24000-fridge-laments-the-disparities-in-income-and-equity-in-our-country-).” Articles also hold a strong Christian perspective such as this [The leading cause of death globally in 2020 was ABORTION … over 42 MILLION people killed](https://notthebee.com/article/the-leading-cause-of-death-in-2020-was-abortion). This story is correctly sourced to [Worldometers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/worldometer/).
Editorially, stories are written to be humorous while being rooted in fact. All stories reviewed favored the right and, in particular, a Christian perspective.
