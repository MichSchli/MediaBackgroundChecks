[banned from Twitter](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-has-permanently-banned-the-corporate-my-pillow-account-after-founder-mike-lindell-posted-from-it-11612286764) due to the promotion of false election fraud conspiracies.

Analysis / Bias
Lindell TV publishes three videos featuring Mike Lindell claiming widespread election fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election. He believes that his personal friend, former President Donald Trump won the election but lost due to election fraud and coordinated efforts by Democrats. The three videos are titled: Scientific Proof, Mike Lindell on his Election Investigation, and Absolute Proof, which has been widely debunked as baseless conspiracy theories. In general, Lindell TV serves as a portal for Mike Lindell’s election conspiracy videos. Virtually everything on this website is false or misleading.
