History
[Founded in 2018](https://whois.domaintools.com/tbdailynews.com), TB Daily News is a news and opinion website that reports from a conservative perspective. The website lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page, mission statement, disclose author names, or who owns the website. Thanks to Google, we were able to track some information down. Articles are published by Uncle Turtleboy, who is Aiden Kearney from Worcester, Massachusetts. Aiden Kearney is a former teacher who is the sole owner of Worcester Digital Marketing LLC, which previously did business as Turtleboy Digital Marketing LLC. In 2019, the [ACLU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-civil-liberties-union-aclu/) defended Aiden Kearney in [a libel suit](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190808/rhode-island-aclu-defends-turtleboy-against-libel-lawsuit).

Analysis / Bias
In review, TB Daily News primarily covers local news in eastern Massachusettes with a strong right-leaning bias. There is the frequent use of emotionally loaded wording that usually denigrates the left, such as this
[46 Year Old Man Rod Webber Who Lives With Mom In Needham Burns American Flag In Quincy After Crying To Police When First Attempt Failed](https://tbdailynews.com/46-year-old-man-rod-webber-who-lives-with-mom-in-needham-burns-american-flag-in-quincy-after-crying-to-police-when-first-attempt-failed/).
Although most articles reviewed strongly oppose Democrats, they will also call out Republicans, such as this
[Mass GOP Holding Fundraiser At Home Of Accused Child Sex Abuser Luke Noble and Republican Candidates Called To Denounce](https://tbdailynews.com/mass-gop-holding-fundraiser-at-home-of-accused-child-sex-abuser-luke-noble-republican-candidates-called-to-denounce/). When it comes to sourcing, they typically use credible local media such as the [Boston Globe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-globe/) and the [Worcester Telegram](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/telegram-gazette/).
In national politics, they often side with former President Trump and defend him from the opposition, such as this
[Harrington Hospital Nurse Wishes Death Upon President Trump Several Times, Calls Him A Prick And Supporters “Arse Lickers” In Facebook Posts](https://tbdailynews.com/harrington-hospital-nurse-wishes-death-upon-president-trump-several-times-calls-him-a-prick-and-supporters-arse-lickers-in-facebook-posts/). In general, the primary aim of this blog is to sensationalize and agitate readers. In the article [New Bedford Anti-Vaxxer Mom Live Streams Herself Barging Into Hospital To Prove That No One Is Sick From Coronavirus](https://tbdailynews.com/new-bedford-anti-vaxxer-mom-live-streams-herelf-barging-into-hospital-to-prove-that-no-one-is-sick-from-coronavirus/) they open with a bizarre quote equating [anti-vaxxers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and atheists that reads like this “Anti-vaxxers, like atheists, are mostly attention-seeking narcissists whose sole purpose is to tell you how dumb you are and how smart they are by citing thoroughly debunked garbage that they read on 4 Chan.” In summary, Many articles appear to be written to trigger an emotional response from the reader that often favors the right.
