History
[Sovren Media](https://isegoria.com/) (previously known as [ISE Media](https://isegoria.com/ise-media-is-becoming-sovren-media/)) is a video streaming and social media platform founded by Ben Swann in 2021. The platform claims to be “uncensored, blockchain-based, decentralized news and entertainment.” However, Sovren Media has come under scrutiny for hosting conspiracy-related content, including [COVID-19 and monkeypox conspiracies](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/08/russian-media-organ-agrees-to-pay-millions-to-u-s-conspiracy-theorist-for-kremlin-propaganda/). According to [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/), Swann’s credibility has faced scrutiny due to his association with conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and [Kremlin propaganda](https://www.axios.com/2022/08/09/russia-propaganda-ben-swann-conspiracy) involvement. [The Dayton Daily News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dayton-daily-news/) has also reported on Swann’s involvement in [alt-right-related reports.](https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/national/atlanta-news-anchor-fired-after-secretly-trying-revive-alt-right-based-reports/069ihocOfqVw6iayr96cjK/) It’s worth mentioning that Swann also owns [“Truth in Media.”](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-in-media/) [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Sovren Media, a platform known for its alternative media content, often presents perspectives that diverge significantly from mainstream narratives. For example, in the video
[“The COVID Awakening: When Doctors Started Asking Questions,”](https://sovren.media/video/the-covid-awakening-when-doctors-started-asking-questions-4199.html) Sovren Media exhibits a strong bias towards alternative health narratives and skepticism of mainstream science, particularly on COVID-19 vaccines. It focuses on distrust of “big science” and “big Pharma,” discussing adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and promoting treatments like [Ivermectin](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/miscellaneous-drugs/ivermectin/#:~:text=Ivermectin%20is%20not%20approved%20by,CoV%2D2%20in%20cell%20cultures.), which lacks mainstream medical endorsement.
Another Sovren video,
[“Fed Lays Groundwork for ‘Digital Dollar’ That Would Give Gov’t Unprecedented Control’](https://sovren.media/video/fed-lays-groundwork-for-lsquo-digital-dollar-rsquo-that-would-give-gov-rsquo-t-unprecedented-control-676.html) suggests government overreach with a digital dollar, aligning with conspiracy theories. It suggests a scenario where the government could directly intervene in personal finances, a recurring notion in anti-government conspiracy theories. These theories often center around fears of excessive governmental control and the erosion of individual liberties. While concerns about privacy and governmental power in the digital age are valid, framing these concerns in a way that implies nefarious intentions without substantial evidence can veer into conspiracy theory territory. Sovren Media’s content often challenges established scientific and political narratives, appealing to audiences interested in alternative views and risking misinformation.
In general, Sovren Media, influenced by Ben Swann, positions itself as a platform for alternative perspectives, often challenging mainstream scientific and political consensus. Its focus on conspiracy theories and alternative health narratives provides a niche for audiences seeking such content but requires careful consideration and fact-checking by consumers, given the sensitive and often controversial nature of the topics covered.
