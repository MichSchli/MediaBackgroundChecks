Analysis / Bias
In review, The Cato Institute is a right-leaning Libertarian think tank that advocates for privatizing many aspects of Government, such as
[schools](https://www.cato.org/education-fight-map) and [social security](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19782-2005Feb12.html). Cato is also opposed to [Campaign Finance Reform](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/Citizens_United_v_FEC.pdf) and often is criticized for human-influenced [climate change denial](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/senators-call-out-web-of-denial-blocking-action-on-climate-change). While Cato advocates for right-wing economic policies, they support socially liberal positions such as [Gay Marriage](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/federal-marriage-amendment-unnecessary-antifederalist-antidemocratic), [Marijuana Legalization](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/thinking-about-drug-legalization), and [liberalized immigration](http://web.archive.org/web/20050123040340/http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb109/hb_109-65.pdf).
Cato Institute uses moderately loaded language in its headlines and articles such as this:
[The Myth of the Cyber Offense: The Case for Restraint.](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint) Sourcing and proper research are the norms for articles. However, the website’s sidebar offers curated news from other sources that generally lean right, such as the [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/) and the factually mixed [Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/). Story selection typically revolves around limited government issues, emphasizing [free-market capitalism.](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/how-market-failure-arguments-lead-misguided-policy)
In the past, Cato published misleading or
[false information](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/cato-institute/cato-institutes-claim-global-warming-disputed-most/) regarding climate science. Here is [Cato’s current position](https://web.archive.org/web/20180119232157/https://www.cato.org/research/global-warming) on Global Warming: “Global warming is indeed real, and human activity has been a contributor since 1975. But global warming is also a complicated issue that can provoke a very unwise policy in response to political pressure. Although there are many different legislative proposals for substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, there is no operational or tested suite of technologies that can accomplish the goals of such legislation. Fortunately, and contrary to much of the rhetoric surrounding climate change, there is ample time to develop such technologies, which will require substantial capital investment by individuals.” This position has led to [criticism](https://www.desmogblog.com/cato-institute).
