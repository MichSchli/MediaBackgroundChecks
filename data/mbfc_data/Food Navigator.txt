Bias
Food Navigator covers news related to the food industry. News is broken down into the categories science, market trends, business, policy, views, food safety & quality, and promotional features. They also have a section dedicated to food business sectors and resources on different types of food.
Food Navigator publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as
[“Returns Gone Sour: The impact of carbon pricing on the dairy sector,”](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/07/08/Returns-Gone-Sour-The-impact-of-carbon-pricing-on-the-dairy-sector) which is sourced from [The Guardian,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) [stuff.co.nz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stuff/), and [The Irish Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-irish-times/).
They often report on politics as it relates to the food industry with minimal bias such as this
[“President Biden: “Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, employers are competing with each other to attract workers.”](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2021/07/06/President-Biden-Instead-of-workers-competing-with-each-other-for-jobs-that-are-scarce-employers-are-competing-with-each-other-to-attract-worke) This story is properly sourced. However, during the presidency of Donald Trump, they reported negatively on some of his policies, such as this [Safe Food Coalition condemns President Trump’s ‘bean-counting standard.’](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/01/Industry-slams-President-Trump-s-executive-order-on-regulation?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright)
Analysis
When reporting on science, Food Navigator sometimes promotes pseudoscience. For example, they sometimes promote questionable natural cures such as this
[Coronavirus: ‘Significant link’ found between dietary selenium and cure rate](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/05/04/Coronavirus-Significant-link-found-between-dietary-selenium-and-cure-rate?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright). While selenium is known to benefit the immune system, [there isn’t any evidence](https://factcheck.afp.com/list-unproven-covid-19-treatments-debunked-health-experts) that it aids in curing Covid-19. They have also promoted that garlic and onions may prevent cancer [Garlic, onions may offer wide-ranging cancer protection](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2006/12/06/Garlic-onions-may-offer-wide-ranging-cancer-protection?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright). Like above, there are some benefits found in consuming garlic and onions, but [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366009/) have not been able to verify if they are the true cause of the benefits related to cancer.
Further, the Magazine frequently reports on GMOs. Some articles point out the benefits of GMOs such as this
[“GM crops may soon be permitted in EU as study hails health and sustainability benefits of genetic modification techniques,”](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/04/29/GM-crops-may-soon-be-permitted-in-EU-as-study-hails-health-and-sustainability-benefits-of-genetic-modification-techniques) while others promote facts surrounding GMOs such as this [GMA launches GMO Facts website: ‘Ingredients grown using GM technology require fewer pesticides, less water and keep production costs down’](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2013/09/19/GMA-launches-GMO-website-says-GM-food-safe-for-humans-and-planet?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright). Other GMO articles focus on labeling and the industry in general and usually support the consensus of science. In general, Food Navigator holds left of center political bias and supports the consensus of science; however, we did find instances where they lightly promoted pseudoscience. For the most part, they are a pro-science source.
