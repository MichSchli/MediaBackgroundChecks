History
[Founded in 2011](https://whois.domaintools.com/patriotreport.com), the Patriot Report is a conservative news and opinion website that publishes video clips with a short commentary.
There is a total lack of transparency as there is not an about page, names of authors, or disclosure of ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
The Patriot Report does not disclose ownership, however, under the
[terms of service page](https://www.patriotreport.com/terms-of-use/#.XuIuENVKhhE), they copy verbatim the terms of service page from the now-defunct Donald Trump Report. It literally reads the same: “BY USING OR VISITING THIS WEBSITE, DonaldTrumpReport.com and all mobile websites and applications associated therewith (collectively, the “Site“) and content available through the [http://www.DonaldTrumpReport.com](http://www.DonaldTrumpReport.com) domain name and any other affiliated domain name, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO BOTH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the “Terms of Use”).” They do not appear to generate revenue at this time.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Patriot Report republishes right-leaning video clips with the addition of a few lines of biased commentary. There is significant use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Stacey Abrams wants illegal aliens to be able to vote because it would balance “white people”](https://www.patriotreport.com/stacey-abrams-wants-illegal-aliens-to-be-able-to-vote-because-it-would-balance-white-people/#.XuIuoNVKhhE). This headline is completely misleading as Stacey Abrams is talking about school districts and not federal elections. Other articles contain blatant emotional wording such as this [Nervous Nancy has to be Corrected by a Reporter After Mispronouncing Words](https://www.patriotreport.com/nervous-nancy-has-to-be-corrected-by-a-reporter-after-mispronouncing-words/#.XuIvBNVKhhE). In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left with the use of misleading headlines that do not match the content of video clips. This is not a credible source on any level.
