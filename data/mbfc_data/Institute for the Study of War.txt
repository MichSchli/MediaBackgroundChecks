History
Founded in May 2007,
[the Institute for the Study of War (ISW)](https://www.understandingwar.org/who-we-are) is a non-profit (501(c)(3)) [neoconservative](https://militarist-monitor.org/profile/frederick-kagan/) public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to defense and foreign affairs research. While its mission is to foster an informed understanding of military affairs, ISW has been characterized as [“hawkish”](https://swampland.time.com/2013/09/17/the-rise-and-fall-of-elizabeth-obagy/) and referred to as [“The Institute for the Promotion of War.”](https://books.google.com/books?id=SU_TEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT19&lpg=PT19&dq=the+Institute+for+the+Study+of+War+(ISW)+hawkish+neocon&source=bl&ots=G14kVrwZne&sig=ACfU3U3IkWeB5ZkoC6Qi1TKabzHmgVClrg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS6ZuMoO6BAxUNm2oFHb7HBW8Q6AF6BAgrEAM#v=onepage&q=the%20Institute%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20War%20(ISW)%20hawkish%20neocon&f=false)
Board members include General Jack Keane, a regular national security analyst on
[Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), who also serves as chairman of both the Institute for the Study of War and AM General, a manufacturer of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (Humvee) and Dr. William Kristol, a political analyst known for advocating American military power.
Further, a
[Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/) [article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/07/washington-isw-ukraine-russia-war-open-source-intelligence/) outlined critiques of ISW, noting that some experienced military analysts viewed ISW’s reports as overly positive about the [Ukrainian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/) military’s capabilities. The article also mentioned the young age and inexperience of some ISW analysts and their use of open-source intelligence, notably from platforms like Telegram, which may contain misinformation.

Analysis / Bias
ISW provides daily updates on the 2022
[Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://www.understandingwar.org/). Additionally, the Iranian military’s regional influence is covered in reports like “ [Iran’s Two Navies](https://www.understandingwar.org/report/irans-two-navies)” and [“The Iran Crisis Updates](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Iran%20Crisis%20Update%2C%20October%2017%20PDF.pdf),” including a report on Iran’s influence in various countries produced by the Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-enterprise-institute/) with support from ISW.
We examined the article
[“Iran Update, October 9, 2023”](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-9-2023) which consistently portrays Hamas and Palestinian militias as always initiating attacks on Israel while depicting Israel’s actions as defensive responses. This perspective aligns with the neoconservative views of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). While the article cites some reputable sources, its interpretation is influenced by these institutional biases.
Cited sources include the
[Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) (Right-Center Bias, mostly factual reporting), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) (Least Biased, Very High factual reporting), and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) (Left-Center Bias, Mixed factual reporting).
In general, The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) claims to be non-partisan but is widely regarded as having close ties to neoconservative ideologies. The organization is known for advocating military interventions. Due to these factors and the influence that its affiliations and contributors may have on its focus and framing, we rate the ISW as editorially right-leaning and mostly factual in reporting due to one-sided reporting.
