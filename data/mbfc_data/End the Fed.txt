History
[Founded in 2015](http://whois.domaintools.com/endthefed.org), End the Fed is a website that advocates for ending the Federal Reserve. The website does not have an about page; however, they state on their [Why Should I Care](http://endthefed.org/why-should-i-care/) page, “Because you’re being systematically robbed and enslaved.” They further state on this page: “If you cherish truth, freedom, justice, and want to leave behind a better world for your loved ones, then you must…END THE FED! A free market, where each individual has the freedom to choose what form of money to use rather than one being forced on them, must be allowed to function in its place.”
The End the Fed website completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page, disclose ownership, or name authors.

Analysis / Bias
In review, End the Fed lays the argument for ending the Federal Reserve while advocating for a free market economy. The website provides
[educational videos](http://endthefed.org/short-videos/), [Documentaries](http://endthefed.org/documentaries/), [recommended books](http://endthefed.org/books/) such as Ron Paul’s End the Fed book, [Lectures](http://endthefed.org/youtube-channels/), and [Youtube Channels](http://endthefed.org/youtube-channels/). Further, they provide a list of recommended websites, with most either on our conspiracy or Questionable source list. Below are a few of their recommended websites.
[Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/)(Conspiracy) [Storm Clouds Gathering](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/storm-clouds-gathering/)(Conspiracy) [Truth in Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-in-media/)(Questionable) [We Are Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/we-are-change/)(Conspiracy) [Lew Rockwell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/)(Questionable) [Oath Keepers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oath-keepers/)(Questionable/Hate Group)
End the Fed also features a blog that has not been updated since 2020. Blog post headlines utilize loaded emotional language such as this:
[WARNING: THE BUBBLE IS ABOUT TO POP](http://endthefed.org/warning-the-bubble-is-about-to-pop/). This story is only sourced from previous blog posts. Finally, the website promotes conspiracy theories, as evidenced by this [statement](http://endthefed.org/why-should-i-care/): “the Fed’s counterfeiting finances the tools of the government’s oppression over you: the militarization of the police, the surveillance apparatus, and the endless wars.” While this could possibly be true, there is no evidence to support such a claim; therefore, it is a conspiracy theory until such evidence exists.
In general, End the Fed is Libertarian biased and utilizes very poor sources, as evidenced above. This update indicates that they rarely publish new content, so therefore the rating remains unchanged.
