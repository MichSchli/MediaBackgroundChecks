Analysis / Bias
In review, Mercola and colleagues advocate many unproven
[alternative health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) notions, including [homeopathy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-homeopathy/), while [promoting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) [anti-vaccine positions](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/02/27/vitamin-d-better-than-flu-vaccine.aspx). Further, in 2011, Joseph Mercola donated [1 million dollars](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/03/05/vaccinate-or-not/) to an organization that opposes vaccinations. They also claim [increased cancer risks](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/style/could-wearable-computers-be-as-harmful-as-cigarettes.html?_r=0) from mobile devices, labeled pseudoscience by scientists’ consensus. In general, they frequently promote pseudoscience and make false claims.
