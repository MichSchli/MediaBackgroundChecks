Analysis / Bias
Truth Press does not appear to produce original news reporting but rather republishes news stories from other sources. The stories are often reposted in full without giving credit to the original source. For example, in this story from the Far-Right Biased and Questionable
[Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), they republish the story in full without giving credit or providing a hyperlink to the source [Former CDC Director Fires Back At Fauci’s ‘Natural’ Claim](https://truthpress.com/news/former-cdc-director-fires-back-at-faucis-natural-claim/). Not giving credit to the source is a form of plagiarism and copyright infringement.
Under the Video tab, they publish videos from
[Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) Host [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/), such as this [Tucker Carlson: The Great Replacement Is An Electoral Strategy](https://truthpress.com/videos/tucker-carlson-the-great-replacement-is-an-electoral-strategy/). Tucker Carlson has a poor track record with [fact checkers](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Tucker%20Carlson) and often promotes conspiracy theories beneficial to the right. Other sources used by Truth Press include the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [USSA News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ussa-news/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and often promote conspiracies such as this from
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) [FBI Sabotaged Hunter Biden Evidence To Derail Investigation: Whistleblowers](https://truthpress.com/news/fbi-sabotaged-hunter-biden-evidence-to-derail-investigation-whistleblowers/) and pseudoscience related to vaccines such as this [Studies Link Incurable Prion Disease With Covid Vaccines](https://truthpress.com/news/studies-link-incurable-prion-disease-with-covid-vaccines/). This claim is [false](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-checking-claims-that-covid-vaccines). In general, Truth Press republishes conservative news from mostly poor sources and lacks credibility due to zero transparency and frequent promotion of misinformation.
