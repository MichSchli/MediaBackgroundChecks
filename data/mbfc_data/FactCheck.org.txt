Funded by / Ownership

[ The Annenberg Foundation](https://annenberg.org/). The website is [fully transparent](https://www.factcheck.org/our-funding/) in listing all funding from sources over $1,000.

*In our last review, we indicated that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated to the Annenberg Foundation. This was in error, as that donation went to the
[California-based Annenberg](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2018/09/opp1196708), which is not connected to Factcheck.org.
