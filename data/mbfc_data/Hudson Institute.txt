Analysis / Bias
In review, the Hudson Institute’s website publishes news and research from a conservative/libertarian perspective. Under the research category, they publish articles with minimally loaded language, such as this:
[Coronavirus and the Chinese Economy: Watching for Signs of a Further Slowdown](https://www.hudson.org/research/15790-coronavirus-and-the-chinese-economy-watching-for-signs-of-a-further-slowdown). This research piece is properly sourced to such publications as the [Wall Street Journal.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) The website also features a section where they provide links to other sources where Hudson Institute members/staff are mentioned.
Regarding scientific issues such as
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), the Hudson Institute supports the consensus of science that climate is influenced by human activity; however, they disagree with Government regulation in favor of free-market solutions: [An American Way to Tackle Climate Change and Battle Global Warming](https://www.hudson.org/research/15763-an-american-way-to-tackle-climate-change-and-battle-global-warming).
Editorially, they have an unfavorable view of Democratic policy while generally supporting the former Trump administration:
[Trumpism, Nationalism, and Conservatism](https://www.hudson.org/research/14831-trumpism-nationalism-and-conservatism). In general, research and reporting are factual, with a strong right-leaning conservative bias.
