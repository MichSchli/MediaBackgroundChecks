Analysis / Bias
Determining a news aggregator’s bias differs from a single source that produces original content. DollarCollapse.com aggregates news and opinions from
[RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) (Rated Questionable), [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/) (Rated Least Biased), [Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/#google_vignette) (Rated Least Biased), [Daily Mail ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/)(Rated Questionable), [Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) (Rated Conspiracy-Pseudoscience). However, the website also features “Articles,” where they publish guest posts.
The articles cover various topics, including debt, economy, inflation, monetary policy, and precious metals. Each article is attributed to guest posts by various authors on different platforms, with the majority being right-leaning, such as
[ Mises Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/), [Real Clear Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/), and [Brownstone Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brownstone-institute-bias/), indicating a right bias.
In the article
[“Unicoin: Universal Monetary Unit Paves the Way to Global Currency,”](https://dollarcollapse.com/unicoin-universal-monetary-unit-paves-the-way-to-global-currency/) the author discusses the potential implications of a global digital currency, specifically Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The article’s wording suggests skepticism towards CBDCs and centralized control. Phrases like “CBDCs are a danger to freedom” and “We don’t have to stumble into the New World Order blindly” indicate a critical stance. The article praises politicians like [Florida Governor Ron DeSantis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ron-desantis-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and Texas Senator Ted Cruz for speaking out against CBDCs. It also discusses concerns about massive government surveillance and control, suggesting a tendency to promote conspiracy theories.
In the second article, “
[David James: The Global War on Thought Crime, “](https://dollarcollapse.com/david-james-the-global-war-on-thought-crime/) the author criticizes laws banning disinformation and misinformation. The article argues that such laws are a form of censorship and an attack on free speech. Phrases like “Governments often make incorrect claims, and made many during Covid” and “In their push to cancel unapproved content, out-of-control governments are seeking to penalize what George Orwell called ‘thought crimes'” indicate a skeptical view of government actions and a tendency to question official narratives, which aligns with a right-leaning or libertarian perspective.
