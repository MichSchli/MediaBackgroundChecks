Analysis / Bias
In review, Bust Magazine covers lifestyle news from a feminist perspective. Politics is not heavily covered; however, there is a strong left-leaning bias with frequent use of loaded wording such as this:
[Why Some Male Politicians Won’t Be Alone With Women — And Why That’s F*Cked Up](https://bust.com/feminism/196246-billy-graham-rule-politicians-avoid-women.html). Like most on the website, this story is correctly sourced to High and Mostly Factual left-leaning sources such as the [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [Huff Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/) [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), and [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/).
Bust Magazine also does not report favorably on the right and the former Trump administration, such as this:
[Trump’s Racism Has Always Been Indisputable, Now It’s Becoming Even More Blatant.](https://bust.com/general/196221-trump-s-racism-has-always-been-indisputable-now-it-s-becoming-even-more-blatant.html) Editorially, there is a strong left bias in political advocacy for liberal causes.
Failed Fact Checks
