Analysis / Bias
In review, all articles favor the right through strong emotional wording and story selection. Conservative Today sources information, but many times they select right biased factually mixed sources such as
[The Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and [The Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). Further, they have promoted the debunked [Clinton uranium conspiracy](https://conservativetoday.com/tables-turned-now-democrats-russia-problem/). As of 2020, they are minimally publishing new content and therefore we maintain their rating.
