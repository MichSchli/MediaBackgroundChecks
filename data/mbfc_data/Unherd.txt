History
Founded in 2017, Unherd is a British news and opinion website providing analysis and essays on current topics. According to their
[about page](https://unherd.com/about-unherd/), “We are not aligned with any political party, and the writers and ideas we are interested in come from both left and right traditions. But we instinctively believe that the way forward will be found through a shift of emphasis: towards community, not just individualism, towards responsibilities as well as Rights, and towards meaning and virtue over shallow materialism.” [Read our profile on UK media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Unherd about page claims its mission is to “push back against the herd mentality with new and bold thinking and to provide a platform for otherwise unherd ideas, people and places.” The content of the website consists mainly of opinion pieces.
Unherd publishes essays, analyses, and opinions under the themes Capitalism, Flyover Country, Global Affairs, Groupthink, and Faith and Meaning. Articles and headlines often use emotionally loaded wording such as
[Why the Tories love a clown show](https://unherd.com/2022/07/why-the-tories-love-a-clown-show/), and [The West needs to grow up](https://unherd.com/2022/07/the-west-needs-to-grow-up/). Articles are usually properly sourced from credible outlets such as [Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/) and the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/).
Editorially, Unherd covers both sides and is critical of the left and right. However, in reviewing dozens of articles, more favor the right and are critical of the left, such as this
[Red alert: the childish fad for socialism](https://unherd.com/2019/07/red-alert-the-foolish-fad-for-socialism/) and [Joe Biden brought a sponge to a knife fight](https://unherd.com/2020/09/joe-biden-brought-a-sponge-to-a-knife-fight/). Regarding science, they hold right-leaning views on climate change, [The great climate change fallacy](https://unherd.com/2021/11/the-great-climate-change-fallacy/). Further, when reporting on Covid-19 and vaccines, some opinions are hesitant, and others are not, but none are opposed to the consensus of science. In general, Unherd is primarily factual in reporting and holds a right-leaning editorial bias.
