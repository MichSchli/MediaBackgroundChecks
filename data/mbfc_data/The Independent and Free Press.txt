In review, The Independent and Free Press uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[‘Shots fired’: Police arrest 9 in Georgetown shooting that leaves 3 hospitalized](https://www.theifp.ca/news/shots-fired-police-arrest-9-in-georgetown-shooting-that-leaves-3-hospitalized/article_d0b813f8-4da2-5c4c-9e67-cb55dc44ae9e.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
