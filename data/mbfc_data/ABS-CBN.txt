Analysis / Bias
Reporters without Borders (RSF) has ranked the Philippines among one of the worst-ranked countries for 2023 at 132th place out of 180 countries and indicates that “The Philippines continues to be one of the most dangerous countries for the media. Private militias, often hired by local politicians, silence journalists with complete impunity.”
Regarding the political stance of ABS-CBN, according to a
[Manila Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-manila-times/) [article](http://www.manilatimes.net/duterte-threatens-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal/324591/), President Rodrigo Duterte threatened to block the ABS-CBN franchise renewal as he claimed the network did not show his political ads during the 2016 campaign. However, his campaign team had paid for the air time.
In review, on national news ABS-CBN utilizes neutral or minimally biased language both on headlines and articles; however, they tend to use large quotes instead of linking the source. International news coverage is syndicated directly from
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), which we rate as least biased.
