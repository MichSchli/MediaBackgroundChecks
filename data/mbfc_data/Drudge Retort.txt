The site was designed in a similar style and releases news in a similar way. The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose an about page or ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Drudge Retort does not produce original content but rather serves as a news aggregator for mostly left-leaning media sources. A quick review of sources reveals the following:
[The Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/)(Left) [Courier-Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-courier-journal/)( Left-Center) [MSN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msn-com/)(Left-Center) [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)( Least Biased) [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)(Left-Center)
Besides these sources, they sometimes aggregate sources that have failed fact checks, such as
[Raw Story](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/raw-story/), [Alternet](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/alternet/), and the [Daily Kos](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-kos/). The website also provides links to liberal-leaning blogs and pundits such as Rachel Maddow, Robert Reich, and Paul Krugman. In general, most news published on the Drudge Retort leads to factual sources; however, some do not; therefore, we cannot rate them High for factual reporting.
