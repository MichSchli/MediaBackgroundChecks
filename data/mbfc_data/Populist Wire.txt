Funded by / Ownership
Again, the website does not have an about page to disclose ownership, and the
[domain](http://whois.domaintools.com/populistwire.com) is registered privately. Populist Wire is funded through online advertising, donations and a [store](https://www.populistwire.com/store/) that sells merchandise with its branding.
Analysis / Bias
The Populist Wire is a news and opinion website/blog that publishes stories with strong emotional wording such as this:
[[Video] Jim Ascosta of CNN accosts the President of the United States again.](https://www.populistwire.com/media/video-jim-ascosta-of-cnn-accosts-the-president-of-the-united-states-again/) In general, stories tend to favor the right through story selection and wording. Populist Wire always sources their information, however they sometimes use [poor sources](https://www.populistwire.com/media/liberty-series-setting-brushfires-for-liberty-on-americas-last-july-4th-alex-jones/) such as conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones](https://www.populistwire.com/media/liberty-series-setting-brushfires-for-liberty-on-americas-last-july-4th-alex-jones/). During the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, Populist Wire promoted misinformation such as this [COVID-19 Really?](https://www.populistwire.com/culture/covid-19-really/) and [Should the media and politicians be held responsible for fraudulent hydroxychloroquine reports?](https://www.populistwire.com/politics/should-the-media-and-politicians-be-held-responsible-for-fraudulent-hydroxychloroquine-reports/)
