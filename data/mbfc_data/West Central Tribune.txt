Analysis / Bias
In review, the West Central Tribune publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as
[“Rumors swirl around Minnesota state rep taking part in citizen patrol during Floyd protest in Bemidji.”](https://www.wctrib.com/news/crime-and-courts/6517751-Rumors-swirl-around-Minnesota-state-rep-taking-part-in-citizen-patrol-during-Floyd-protest-in-Bemidji) There is also a right-leaning political bias as most stories favor the right such as this [“Ruben Navarrette: I’ll let you in on a little secret: Latinos don’t like Biden.“](https://www.wctrib.com/opinion/6499727-Ruben-Navarrette-Ill-let-you-in-on-a-little-secret-Latinos-dont-like-Biden) A quote from the article reads, “Joe Biden’s weak and pathetic relationship with Latinos is all about geography.” However, they also republish editorial pieces from their sister papers such as the Grand Forks Herald in favor of democratic politicians such as [“Minnesota Opinion: Joe Biden should put Amy Klobuchar on 2020 ticket”](https://www.wctrib.com/opinion/editorials/6499684-Minnesota-Opinion-Joe-Biden-should-put-Amy-Klobuchar-on-2020-ticket).
On the issues such as immigration, the West Central Tribune reports with balance:
[“The economy of immigration: New Americans motivated to be a part of the economy.”](https://www.wctrib.com/news/4625913-economy-immigration-new-americans-motivated-be-part-economy) Further, they also support the consensus of science regarding [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/): [Scientists try to plant forests of the future in a fast-warming Minnesota](https://www.wctrib.com/news/science-and-nature/6473792-Scientists-try-to-plant-forests-of-the-future-in-a-fast-warming-Minnesota).
