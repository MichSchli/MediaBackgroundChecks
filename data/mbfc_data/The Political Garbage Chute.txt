Analysis / Bias
In review, The Political Garbage Chute appropriately disclaims they are satirical on every page with this line “All work is satirical, Billy.” Most satire is political and generally mocks the right with stories such as this
[Fauci Confirms Rand Paul is a ‘Flaming Douchebag With Absolutely Shitty Hair,’ Medically Speaking](https://www.politicalgarbagechute.com/fauci-rand-paul/) or this [Hannity: “If Trump Had Been President During the Civil War, We Would’ve Won It.”](https://www.politicalgarbagechute.com/hannity-trump-civil-war/) In general, this is a transparent satire website.
