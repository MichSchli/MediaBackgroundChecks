Analysis / Bias
In review, Ethnikos Kyrix headlines are moderately emotional in a tone such as this
[“Erdogan’s plans for the first prayer in Hagia Sophia.”](https://www.ekirikas.com/ellada_politiki/arthro/ta_sxedia_tou_erntogan_gia_tin_proti_proseuxi_stin_agia_sofia-594245/) The article is sourced to factually mixed Right biased German paper [Bild](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bild/) and Italian Newspaper Il Messaggero, and local Greek news sites such as Efimerida ton Syntakton through quotes.
Typically stories are sourced with large quotes and, politically, lean right. For example, when covering Greece, they use moderately emotionally loaded headlines that favor
[Center-Right](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48902766) New Democracy party leader and current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis [“Avramopoulos: Kyriakos Mitsotakis created a positive future for citizens and the economy](https://www.ekirikas.com/archive_politics/arthro/abramopoulos_o_kyriakos_mitsotakis_dimioyrgise_thetiko_mellon_gia_tous_polites_kai_tin_oikonomia-144734/).” On the other hand, they critically cover former Prime Minister and left-wing Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras, such as [“Alexis Tsipras: Absent.”](https://www.ekirikas.com/archive_politics/arthro/aleksis_tsipras_apon-143864/) A quote from the article reads, “Greek voters, however, a month and a half ago seem to have punished him for these behaviors as well. Unless he wants to admit it.”
Ethnikos Kyrix covers world and USA news through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). In general, they report international news factually while presenting Greek news with poor sourcing techniques and moderate right-leaning editorial bias.
