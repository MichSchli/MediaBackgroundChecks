Analysis / Bias
In review, Stuppid implies that the news they publish is satirical or at the very least stupid “Stuppid.com reports stupid news we find around the web and from other sources. We aim to publish the stupidest, craziest stuff we can find.” A typical story reads
[Man Hires Hookers, Daughters Show Up To Room](http://stuppid.com/man-hires-hooker-daughters/). A review of numerous stories indicates some are satire and some are real, but all are crazy and stupid as they disclaim.
