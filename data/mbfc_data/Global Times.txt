Analysis / Bias
In review, the Global Times publishes news regarding China and internationally with a pro-Chinese government bias. While many stories are factual and low biased, there is a significant bias by omission where they do not report negatively on the Chinese Government nor positively on western news. For example, they often use loaded emotional language to describe the United States:
[US disgraceful to undermine WTO](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1172882.shtml), while often celebrating President Xi Jinping such as this [Amazed to witness China’s rise first hand](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1173000.shtml). It is not that the Global Times is reporting false information; they are not reporting all factual information and promoting pro-Chinese propaganda.
[According](https://qz.com/745577/inside-the-global-times-chinas-hawkish-belligerent-state-tabloid/) to [Quartz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quartz/), the Global Times is “China’s most belligerent tabloid and is certainly a one-of-a-kind publication. The Chinese- and English-language news outlet is published by the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) paramount mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, but it goes much further than China’s typically stodgy state news. The Global Times is best known for its hawkish, insulting editorials—aggressive attacks that get it noticed and quoted by foreign media around the world as the “voice” of Beijing, even as the party’s official statements are more circumspect.”
