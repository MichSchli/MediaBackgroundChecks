Analysis / Bias
In review, the Miami Herald covers South Florida news through journalists and with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[The price of gas in Florida may go down this week. Here’s why](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article232399167.html). National and international news is derived primarily from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/).
Editorially, the Miami Herald has
[endorsed Democratic Presidential candidates](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/) since 2000. Further, most editorials favor the political left and sometimes utilize loaded emotional language such as these: [The Invading Sea: Democrats in debate must focus on solutions to climate change](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article231917868.html), and [Reprehensible immigrant round-ups in Miami postponed — for now, | Editorial](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article231870293.html). In general, straight news reporting is low biased and factual, while editorially, there is a moderate liberal bias in story selection and policy preferences.
Failed Fact Checks
[Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “used [a] fake news site (Babylon Bee) to raise cash.”](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-is-the-babylon-bee-a-fake?s=r)– Misleading (The [Babylon Bee](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/babylon-bee/)is a clearly labeled satire site.)
