History
Culture Watch News is a hyper-partisan conservative news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://culturewatchnews.com/about/), “America’s culture is rapidly descending into a cesspool. The totalitarian Left now shouts down conservatives in the public square, on college campuses, and runs them out of restaurants. The Left’s war on Christianity is growing.”
The website otherwise lacks transparency as the authors are not named, the domain is registered privately, and ownership is not revealed.

Analysis / Bias
Culture Watch News does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left, such as this:
[Marjorie Taylor Greene ripped one Trump-deranged actress who made a shocking threat](https://culturewatchnews.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-ripped-one-trump-deranged-actress-who-made-a-shocking-threat/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on the information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Leftists are seething after Hollywood Republicans flexed their strength with this audacious move](https://culturewatchnews.com/leftists-are-seething-after-hollywood-republicans-flexed-their-strength-with-this-audacious-move/), and [Hate-filled Nashville leftists put their derangement on full display in fury over Aldean speech](https://culturewatchnews.com/hate-filled-nashville-leftists-put-their-derangement-on-full-display-in-fury-over-aldean-speech/). In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing conspiracy theories and propaganda, sometimes using poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
