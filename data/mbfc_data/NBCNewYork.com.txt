Analysis / Bias
In review, NBCNewYork.com primarily covers news related to New York City and the immediate suburbs of the city. Local news is usually delivered in video format with text written content derived from journalists and reporters. Local news is covered with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[Four Sleeping Homeless Men Beaten to Death Early Saturday Morning in NYC’s Chinatown; 1 in Custody: Police](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Four-Homeless-Men-Beaten-to-Death-Early-Saturday-Morning-in-NYCs-Chinatown-562257851.html). National and world news is delivered through the left-leaning [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/). The website also features investigations from the I-Team that focus on local corruption and crimes, such as this: [Question Authority: Inside NYC’s Public Housing Crisis](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/NYCHA-Question-Authority-podcast-NBC-4-investigations-560905441.html).
NBCNewYork.com does not publish op-eds; however, story selection, in general, tends to slightly lean left.
