History
Launched in 1887,
[Le Soir](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148689/le-soir) is a French-language Belgian daily newspaper based in Brussels, Belgium. Emile Rossel founded the paper as an independent news source, and to maintain independence, Rossel decided to finance the paper through commercial advertising. As a result, he founded the“Agence Rossel,” the First advertising agency in Brussels. Le Soir is also a part of the Leading European Newspaper Alliance (LENA), and they provide selected articles to this joint platform under plus.lesoir.be (subscription required). Le Soir covers the world and national news, political analysis, sports, and culture. [Béatrice Delvaux](https://twitter.com/beadelvaux?lang=en) is the editor-in-chief of Le Soir.

Analysis / Bias
In 2021,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Belgium 11/180 in their [Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/belgium). The Prime Minister of Belgium is [Alexander De Croo](https://www.voanews.com/europe/7-parties-agree-belgian-government-led-liberal-de-croo), who leans center-right (The [coalition government](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-parliamentary-elections-archive-elections-3bf390ed4a780673027c937fe2f164da) consists of Liberals, Socialists, and Greens).
[Le Soir’s](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148689/le-soir) political orientation is defined as Liberal, which is the center-right in Belgium. Le Soir columnists are known experts in their areas, such as [Jean-Paul Marthoz](https://plus.lesoir.be/5626/dpi-authors/jean-paul-marthoz), a Columnist for “Soir,” covering national politics. He also teaches international journalism at the [Université Catholique de Louvain](https://www.journalismfestival.com/speaker/jean-paul-marthoz). He has been European press director for [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/) and an EU correspondent for the Committee to Protect Journalists.
In review, Le Soir reports political news in a neutral tone with minimally loaded language in their headlines, such as
[“Crisis center: “Your behavior during the holidays will be decisive](https://www.lesoir.be/341268/article/2020-12-02/centre-de-crise-votre-comportement-durant-les-fetes-sera-determinant-infographie).” They also often use Belga (Belgium news agency) as their source and the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). When covering USA news/world news, Le Soir generally relies on the [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), such as this [“US presidential election: Justice Minister did not “see enough fraud” to invalidate Biden’s victory.”](https://www.lesoir.be/341193/article/2020-12-01/presidentielle-americaine-le-ministre-de-la-justice-na-pas-vu-de-fraude)
Editorially, some articles are only available to subscribers; therefore, our analysis is limited to their free articles. However, the op-eds we were able to review were reasonably balanced with more leaning left, such as this
[Cevipol’s carte blanche: “Women politicians: leaders like no other?”](https://plus.lesoir.be/341271/article/2020-12-02/la-carte-blanche-du-cevipol-femmes-politiques-des-leaders-pas-comme-les-autres) and this [In France, it is urgent to build an exemplary police force](https://plus.lesoir.be/340731/article/2020-11-30/en-france-il-est-urgent-de-batir-une-police-exemplaire). Since we were unable to read enough op-eds to make a qualified determination of editorial bias, we are moderately confident that Le Soir falls on the left side of least biased and highly factual in reporting based on our small sampling.
