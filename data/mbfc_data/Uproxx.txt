Analysis / Bias
In review, Uproxx is almost exclusively an entertainment and culture website; however, they do occasionally publish politics-related news. When covering politics, they present with a left-leaning bias through the use of loaded words such as this:
[Stormy Daniels Showed Jimmy Kimmel Which Mushroom Looks Most Like Donald Trump’s Junk,](https://uproxx.com/tv/stormy-daniels-trump-penis-jimmy-kimmel/) and this: [Brett Kavanaugh’s Former Classmates Are Coming Out Of The Woodwork To Call BS On Him About His ’80s Behavior.](https://uproxx.com/news/brett-kavanaugh-friends-classmates/) Although the headlines use [strongly loaded wording](https://uproxx.com/viral/gop-candidate-bigfoot-porn-denver-riggleman/), the content of the articles is sourced properly. In general, when it comes to politics, Uproxx has a left-leaning editorial bias.
