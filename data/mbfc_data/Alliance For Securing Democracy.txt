History
The
[Alliance for Securing Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Marshall_Fund) is a transatlantic project that states its mission as “Democracies worldwide are under assault. Concerted efforts by malign actors to undermine democratic processes and erode democratic institutions pose a foundational threat to the United States and its democratic partners in Europe, Asia, and beyond. External threats from authoritarian governments have coincided with internal challenges from domestic actors to weaken democratic norms and institutions.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

The Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD), a

Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the blog portion of this website, I found it well-sourced and stuck to the topic of misinformation campaigns in elections. All information was well-sourced to mostly mainstream credible news sources that ranged from Left-Center to Right-Center in bias. The Alliance for Securing Democracy has also developed a tool called
[Hamilton 68](http://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/) that tracks Russian propaganda on Twitter. We cannot verify the accuracy of this tool, but the information is interesting and delivered without comment. The Intercept has also criticized the Alliance for Securing Democracy for presenting a [right-leaning hawkish viewpoint](https://theintercept.com/2017/07/17/with-new-d-c-policy-group-dems-continue-to-rehabilitate-and-unify-with-bush-era-neocons/).
Editorially, we found a slightly right-leaning bias that favors a more interventionist perspective, but not enough to move this source out of the least biased category.
