History
According to their
[about page](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Wikispooks:About), “WikiSpooks was established in 2010 as a collaborative space for the joint re-examination of recent history. We research people and [groups](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Group) not subject to proper scrutiny by corporate media and as such, poorly treated by [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/). WikiSpooks is particularly focused on those [official narratives](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Official_narrative) which do not seem to fit the facts, such as the [9/11](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/9/11) [event](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Event) and [concepts](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Concept) such as the “ [war on terror](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/War_on_terror)” or the “ [war on drugs](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/War_on_drugs).”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Wikispooks claims to be a source of deep politics, with a forum that publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience like this
[Bilderberg/Effect](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Bilderberg/Effect).
In 2022, they publish misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccines, such as
[this](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Vaccine), where they claim covid-19 vaccines are self-spreading. [This is false](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-225957174726). They also have a page dedicated to the 2020 Presidential Election, where they allege voting fraud conspiracies. This is not a credible source.
