Analysis / Bias
EuroWeekly News focuses on community news and issues relevant to expatriates living in Spain. It claims to deliver news with a social conscience. The paper does not exhibit a strong political or ideological bias.
The first article we reviewed, “
[Holly Willoughby Kidnap Threat](https://euroweeklynews.com/2023/10/06/holly-willoughby-kidnap-threat/?utm_source=breaking&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=promoted-stories),” reports on a kidnap conspiracy against TV presenter Holly Willoughby. It cites credible and factually mixed sources, including [The Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/), and maintains a neutral tone. However, the article also includes an unnamed “insider” as a source, which could be seen as tabloid-like reporting.
The second article we reviewed is “
[Meghan Markle: From Royal Duchess to U.S. Politics](https://euroweeklynews.com/2023/10/04/meghan-markle-from-royal-duchess-to-us-politics/),” which discusses Meghan Markle’s rumored entry into U.S. politics, mainly the speculation around her potentially filling a vacant Senate seat. It cites Angela Levin, a Royal Family author, and refers to an article from the [Daily Express](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-express/) with a Right-Center bias. Overall, the article provides factual information but includes some elements that could be interpreted as editorializing.
The last article we reviewed, “
[The Internet Hilariously Takes Down Sunak’s New Approach to Net Zero](https://euroweeklynews.com/2023/10/03/the-internet-hilariously-takes-down-sunaks-new-approach-to-net-zero/),” critiques UK Prime Minister [Rishi Sunak](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rishi-sunak-united-kingdom-facts-and-bias/)‘s net-zero strategy through satire and social media reactions. Citing the UK government’s [Net-Zero Strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1033990/net-zero-strategy-beis.pdf) document, the article leans towards a left-center bias, given its critical view of right-center Sunak.
