History
[Founded in 2015](http://whois.domaintools.com/thelibertybeacon.com) by Roger Landry, The Liberty Beacon is a far-right conspiracy and pseudoscience website. According to their about page, “TLB has a close association with approximately about 500 groups and pages of like mind on FaceBook and is partnered with about two dozen independent (true) media and Holistic health or health tyranny websites. We also benefit highly from contributions and close personal contacts with many professionals, authors, media personnel, and journalists in many countries across the globe that provide us (as active contributors) with real-time information you won’t see or hear on the mainstream media.” [Read our profile on USA media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Liberty Beacon routinely publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience information. When it comes to pseudoscience, they
[promote](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) [anti-GMO propaganda](http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/what-are-gmos-the-ultimate-killing-machine/) and [anti-Vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) fear-mongering. They also report on the Government’s use of [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) as a means of [GeoEngineering](http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/new-geoengineering-initiative-a-nurse-talks-about-chemtrails-a-new-documentary/). Regarding conspiracies, they report on the dangers of the so-called [New World Order](http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/?s=new+world+order), the [Clintons as murderers](http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/clinton-foundation-cfo-i-know-where-all-the-bodies-are-buried/), and numerous claims of [false flags,](http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/?s=false+flag) including 9-11.
Regarding sourcing, virtually all of them are either Questionable, fellow conspiracy sites, or far-right biased. Here are some sample sources we found:
[Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), and [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/). Finally, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have promoted false and misleading claims.
