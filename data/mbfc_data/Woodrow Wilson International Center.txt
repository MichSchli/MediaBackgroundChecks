Funded by / Ownership
The Center is a public-private partnership. Approximately one-third of the Center’s operating funds come annually from an appropriation from the U.S. government, and the Center itself is housed in a wing of the Ronald Reagan Building, a federal office building where the Center enjoys a 30-year rent-free lease. The
[remainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_International_Center_for_Scholars) of the Center’s funding comes from foundations, grants and contracts, corporations, individuals, endowment income, and subscriptions.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars generally advocates for left-leaning positions such as concern for
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), as seen here: [Climate Change: Is Urgency for Action Growing?](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/climate-change-urgency-for-action-growing) The organization also appeals to left-leaning positions such as [human rights](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/issue/human-rights) and the conservation of resources. They also favor pro-immigration measures that are evidence-based.
In general, this is a left-center, evidence-based source.
