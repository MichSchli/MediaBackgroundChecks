- Fiscal Responsibility: The emphasis on reducing national debt and responsible budgeting is a common conservative viewpoint.
- Energy Strategy: Advocating for an all-encompassing energy strategy, including clean energy development, shows a balanced approach but leans right due to the inclusion of traditional energy sources.
Left-Leaning Positions:
- Women’s Reproductive Rights: Striking a balance in protecting women’s rights over their reproductive health is a stance more commonly associated with liberal views.

- Support for Small Businesses: Encouraging the growth of small businesses and reducing regulatory barriers is a pragmatic approach often favored by moderates.
