History
[Founded in 2014](https://whois.domaintools.com/newsheist.com), News Heist was a news curation website that does not produce original content. However, in 2023 they simply link to a variety of sources placed in different categories such as News & Politics, Tech, Finance, and Cryptocurrency. The website completely lacks transparency as there is zero information on anything.
Funded by / Ownership
News Heist does not disclose ownership or a revenue model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, News Heist is a news link portal that links to other sources. The majority of sources they endorse fall along the extreme right, conspiratorial, and low factual categories. The website also displays an icon of
[Pepe the Frog](https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/pepe-the-frog) as their browser avatar, which is a symbol of racist, antisemitic, sexist, or other bigoted themes. Some of the sources they link to are the Questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [OANN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/), and [Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bongino-com/), as well as conspiracy sites [True Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/true-pundit/) and [Zero Hedge,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) to name a few. Not much else to report here. They link to poor sources who routinely fail fact checks and mostly have a strong right-leaning bias.
