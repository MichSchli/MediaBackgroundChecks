Analysis / Bias
In review, Black America Web
[republishes](https://blackamericaweb.com/category/news/top-news/) news stories from credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). They also frequently use moderate, emotionally loaded language in their headlines, such as [“Barack Obama Takes Aim At Donald Trump’s Response To Coronavirus Pandemic.”](https://blackamericaweb.com/2020/04/01/barack-obama-takes-aim-at-donald-trumps-response-to-coronavirus-pandemic/) When it comes to entertainment news, they typically publish news related to African American actors and artists.
Under the section uplifting news, they publish a list of black-owned businesses such as this
[“#BuyBlack: 121 Black-Owned Fashion, Style, Beauty, And Hair Businesses”](https://blackamericaweb.com/2020/06/09/black-owned-fashion-style-beauty-and-hair-businesses/). Further, the website promotes radio shows such as political activist [Al Sharpton’s](https://www.biography.com/activist/al-sharpton) syndicated radio show, [“Keeping it Real with Al Sharpton Show](http://www.reachmediainc.com/sharpton.html).”
When reporting on politics, they frequently favor the left and denigrate the right such as this: “
[Stacey Dash Officially Files For Divorce, Makes $2500 A Month”](https://blackamericaweb.com/2020/06/17/stacey-dash-officially-files-for-divorce-she-makes-2500-a-month/). A quote from the article reads, “The GOP flunkie and ‘Karen”’ wannabe has filed for divorce from her fourth husband; now we’re not usually into wallet shaming, but considering Dash is a Team MAGA Trump supporter, she’s going to have to hold this slander.” This quote was sourced from the factually mixed source [TMZ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tmz/). In general, story selection consistently favors the left and is mostly factual due to the occasional use of poor sources such as TMZ.
