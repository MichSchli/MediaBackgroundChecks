History
The Gateway Pundit publishes extremely right-biased news and commentary that promotes conspiracy theories and the routine publication of falsehoods (see analysis). The website was founded by
[Jim Hoft](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/13/jim-hoft-conservative-blogger-comes-out-as-gay-aft/) in 2004 to “speak the truth” and to “expose the wickedness of the left.”
According to their about page, “The Gateway Pundit is one of the top political websites. It is consistently
[ranked](https://directorblue.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-top-150-conservative-websites-june.html) as [one of the top political blogs](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2011/10/thank-you-for-your-support-october-was-a-record-month/) in the nation. TGP has been cited by [Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hannity-com/), [Rush Limbaugh](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/), [The Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/), [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), Mark Levin, [FOX Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), and several international news organizations.”
On 6/6/2021, The Gateway Pundit was moved to Very-Low factual reporting based on failed facts on a
[near-daily basis](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=gateway%20pundit).
On 6/20/2021, The Gateway Pundit wrote a negative article about Media Bias Fact Check –
[Bogus Fact-Check Site Used by Google Lists All Conservative Outlets as “Low Credibility” – But Lists All Far Left and Liberal Mainstream Outlets as High Credibility](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/06/bogus-fact-check-site-used-google-lists-conservative-outlets-low-credibility-lists-far-left-liberal-mainstream-outlets-high-credibility/). A usual this is full of misinformation. First, we have numerous left-biased sources listed as questionable and low credibility. Further, as far as we know we are not used by Google. [On 12/2/2021](https://newsfactsnetwork.com/2021/12/02/georgia-election-workers-suing-conspiracy-website-over-campaign-of-lies/), it was announced that two election workers in Georgia are suing The Gateway Pundit for conducting “a campaign of lies” that “instigated a deluge of intimidation, harassment, and threats that has forced them to change their phone numbers, delete their online accounts, and fear for their physical safety.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Gateway Pundit demonstrates extreme right-wing bias in story selection that always favors the right and denigrates the left. There is significant use of loaded emotional language in headlines such as this:
[President Trump RIPS INTO Peter Strzok After He’s Fired – Calls For Hillary ‘Sham Investigation’ to be ‘Properly Redone](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/08/president-trump-rips-into-peter-strzok-after-hes-fired-calls-for-hillary-sham-investigation-to-be-properly-redone/).’ The Gateway Pundit is also fiercely dedicated to the [promotion of Donald Trump.](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/08/ttrump-and-the-commies-anti-communist-donald-trump-vs-commie-sympathizing-anti-trumpers-brennan-nellie-ohr-steele-comey/) TGP always sources their information but sometimes utilizes questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and [Mike Cernovich](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/04/cernovich-google-hired-contractors-de-list-infowars-search-index/), who have terrible track records with fact-checkers.
The Gateway Pundit has published numerous false or conspiracy stories such as
[Hillary Clinton](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/01/24/the-right-is-building-a-new-media-upside-down-to-tell-trumps-story.html) having a seizure, identifying an innocent person in the [Las Vegas mass shooting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/02/how-far-right-trolls-named-the-wrong-man-as-the-las-vegas-shooter/), and identifying the wrong person after the motor vehicle homicide at the [White Supremacist rally](http://www.joemygod.com/2018/02/17/homocon-jim-hoft-chuck-c-johnson-paul-nehlen-others-sued-falsely-naming-teen-killer-driver/) in Charlottesville, Virginia. Further, [TGP claimed](https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/02/20/right-wing-media-david-hogg/) the “FBI received tips well in advance of the Florida school shooting and decided, for whatever reason, not to act.” Finally, based on publishing false information, TGP has [faced lawsuits](https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/02/17/gotnews-disreputable-sites-sued-naming-innocent-teen-charlottesville-killer/) for defamation and damages to innocent individuals. In general, The Gateway Pundit holds extreme right viewpoints and publishes false or misleading information on a near-daily basis.
According to
[Open Feedback](https://open.feedback.org/Media/LM) The Gateway Pundit frequently makes false and misleading claims regarding science. This indicates a heavy promotion of pseudoscience especially as it relates to Covid-19 and vaccines.
