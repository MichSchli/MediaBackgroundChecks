Analysis / Bias
For our analysis, we examined a number of articles from FairPlanet to better understand its journalistic standards and ideological orientation. We’ll focus on two articles to illustrate these points. “Green Financing, Kenyan Style” and “Should We Eat Roadkill?”.
The framing in the article
[“Green Financing, Kenyan Style”](https://www.fairplanet.org/editors-pick/green-financing-kenyan-style/) leans toward a positive perspective on [Kenyan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kenya-media-profile/) banks’ sustainable and green financing initiatives. However, it also mentions the challenges of implementing these initiatives effectively. The tone is more informative than laudatory, aiming to provide a balanced view. Regarding the use of sources, It cites multiple credible sources, such as the [Sustainable Finance Initiative](https://sfi.kba.co.ke/) and an academic paper from [USIU Africa](https://erepo.usiu.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11732/7199/Gachanjah%20Evelyn%20Wanjiru%20MIR%202022.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
On the other hand, the article
[“Should We Eat Roadkill?”](https://www.fairplanet.org/story/should-we-eat-roadkill/) leans toward advocating for the consumption of roadkill as an ethical and sustainable food source. The article provides reasons supporting this viewpoint, such as reducing waste and lowering the environmental impact of meat production, but does not extensively cover opposing perspectives, which suggests a more advocacy-oriented approach rather than a neutral presentation of the topic.
Further, There are some issues with hyperlinking. For instance, the word “Scaled globally” redirects to an unrelated book on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55927090), which could be misleading. Nevertheless, the article cites credible sources, such as a scientific paper on [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457620/), UK [government statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/road-lengths-in-great-britain-2022/road-lengths-in-great-britain-2022#headline-figures-in-this-release), [ResearchGate,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/researchgate/) [Scientific American](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/scientific-american/), and [Atlas Obscura](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/atlas-obscura/). One common issue in both articles is the invisibility of hyperlinks due to the lack of color differentiation, making it hard for the reader to identify cited information readily.
Finally, when reporting on political news, they strongly oppose former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as this [TRUMP AND GOP RISK AMERICAN DEMOCRACY](https://www.fairplanet.org/editors-pick/trump-and-gop-risk-american-democracy/). In general, FairPlanet is mostly fact-based and holds left-leaning progressive views.
