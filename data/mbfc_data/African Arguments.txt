Analysis / Bias
In review, African Arguments use loaded language in their headlines and the body of articles such as:
[“Tillerson didn’t do much for Africa. Pompeo could well be worse.”](http://africanarguments.org/2018/03/19/tillerson-didnt-do-much-for-africa-pompeo-could-well-be-worse/) They typically utilize credible sources such as Inter Press Service (IPS), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), parliament. Uk, [Transparency International](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/transparency-international/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and national news sources specific to the country they are reporting about such as [www.nation.co.ke](http://www.nation.co.ke) for Kenya, [Vanguard (Nigeria)](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/03/one-election-far-nullified-watch-inec-chairman/), and [www.thecitizen.co.tz](http://www.thecitizen.co.tz) for Tanzania.
When it comes to US politics, their word choices are anti-Trump, such as
[“Trump’s Africa policy: Unclear and uncertain.”](http://africanarguments.org/2017/02/01/trumps-africa-policy-unclear-and-uncertain/) In general, they are fact-based with a left-leaning editorial bias.
