Analysis / Bias
Classifying this website is difficult because it relies heavily on science, which led me to classify them as a Pro-Science source initially. In reviewing more articles, I began to see that the writers tended to interject many subjective opinions regarding the information they were sourcing. Exposing the Truth does source from credible information, and they use minimal emotional words. The primary reason for a left-center classification is that most of the articles published tended to lean left based on the covered issues, such as climate change, sustainability, etc.
This source has not appeared active since 2019, but the content remains online, keeping them listed.
