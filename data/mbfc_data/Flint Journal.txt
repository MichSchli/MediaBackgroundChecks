Analysis / Bias
The Flint Journal publishes local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this
[2 dead after murder-suicide at Davison home, police say](https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2023/01/2-dead-after-murder-suicide-at-davison-home-police-say.html). National and international news is reported through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other Advance publications.
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion content from a wide, but never extreme, and reasonably balanced perspective. The Bay City Times is a reliable, low-biased, and factual source of information for Michigan News.
