The website features a tagline that reads “THE FIRST IN DECENTRALIZED MEDIA & NEWS.” The RedPill Project lacks transparency as they do have an about page. However, they list the hosts and names of the podcasts they serve. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The RedPill Project lacks transparency as they do not clearly disclose ownership. The copyright marker at the bottom of the pages reads Success Systems | Redpill Project Media. Advertising, donations, and an online shop that sells branded merchandise generate revenue.

The website also features republished news from other sources. Most of the sources they use are either extreme
[right biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right/), [questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/), or [conspiracy/pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/). Some sources they use are [One America News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/) (Questionable), [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/) (Questionable), [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) (Conspiracy-Pseudoscience), and [Just The News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/) (Questionable).
As seen from the list above, they frequently promote conspiracy theories; however, they also promote pseudoscience and medical misinformation related to Covid-19. For example, they report
[CDC Data Reveals Vaccines Are Killing Far More Children Than China Virus Itself](https://www.redpillpodcasts.com/post/cdc-data-reveals-vaccines-are-killing-far-more-children-than-china-virus-itself). This story is false as the vaccines [have not been linked](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/18/fact-check-covid-19-vaccines-not-linked-deaths-children/8584681002/) to Child mortality. In general, the RedPill Project is a far-right biased conspiracy and pseudoscience website that routinely promotes misinformation.
