Analysis / Bias
In review, USAFacts provides statistics and data on various topics ranging from Covid-19, Healthcare, Immigration, and several other topics. Low-biased sourcing from government sources and agencies is the norm. USAFacts does not use any other data, as they explain on their
[FAQ page](https://usafacts.org/faq/) “We rely solely on government data for consistency and to screen for bias. Data curated by think tanks, academics, or any outlet expressing a viewpoint about the data is not reliably nonpartisan.”
The wording used in headlines and reports is low-biased and neutral such as this
[There was one new COVID-19 case for every 76 Americans in November](https://usafacts.org/articles/there-was-one-new-covid-19-case-for-every-76-americans-in-november/). During the Covid-19 pandemic, USAFacts has provided accurate, fact-based statistics that are credible such as this [COVID-19 Impact and Recovery](https://usafacts.org/covid-recovery-hub/). Generally, the information provided is highly factual and reported with minimal bias.
