History
The Independent Voter Network was founded in 2012. From the IVN
[about page](https://independentvoterproject.org/our-work/inform-voters): “The purpose of IVN.us is to provide unfiltered political news and policy analysis across the political spectrum. Unlike traditional media outlets and elsewhere in the “blogosphere” where the diversity of viewpoints is often reduced into partisan circles, IVN actively encourages writers and readers of different political tendencies to engage in a constructive dialogue.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, IVN publishes news and opinion on US politics. Topics include elections, campaigns, healthcare, legislation, and more. The website also publishes podcasts and articles from
[The Fulcrum](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-fulcrum/). Articles and headlines are focused on appealing to the independent voter, sometimes with loaded emotional wording such as this [Joe Biden Can’t Bring Voters Together, But There’s One Reform That Can](https://ivn.us/posts/joe-biden-cant-bring-voters-together-but-theres-one-reform-that-can) and this [Guilty Parties: Our Elections Have Been Stolen; Just Not How You Think](https://ivn.us/posts/guilty-parties-our-elections-have-been-stolen-just-not-how-you-think).
Editorially, op-eds are generally balanced, with opinions from both the right and left. For example, this op-ed leans left
[OPINION: The Best Antidote to Trumpism is More Democracy](https://ivn.us/posts/opinion-the-best-antidote-to-trumpism-is-more-democracy), and this that leans right [Opinion: Justin Amash Is The Adult They Won’t Let On The Debate Stage](https://ivn.us/posts/opinion-justin-amash-is-the-adult-they-wont-let-on-the-debate-stage). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a reasonable left-right editorial bias.
