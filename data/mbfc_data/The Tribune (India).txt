Analysis / Bias
When covering Indian national news, The Tribune (India) tends to be critical of left-leaning opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. In a recent article titled “
[India is not Ukraine, Rahul’s statement violates Nehru’s policy and abandons Indira’s legacy,”](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/india-is-not-ukraine-486796) the paper analyzes a statement made by Rahul Gandhi during his UK visit, where he compared India to [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/) and [Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) to [China](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/). However, the article does not provide a direct link to the speech or any other source quoting Rahul Gandhi’s comparison of India to Ukraine. In comparison, another article explains the same incident by Left-Center Indian news and media website [The Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-wire-india/): [ “What Rahul Gandhi Said in the UK and Why It Hit a Raw Nerve of the BJP’s,”](https://thewire.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-uk-bjp-modi-rajnath-singh) provides details and sources the information.
The Tribune (India) presents positive coverage of the right-leaning PM Modi, as seen in their article titled “
[India shining on world stage, natural for anti-national forces to unite: PM Modi.”](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-only-pan-india-party-today-amidst-family-run-political-outfits-pm-modi-492067) The Tribune (India) also reports on news critical of the ruling party, such as [“Congress slams PM Modi over ‘suicide note’ joke, calls it ‘insensitive,”](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-slams-pm-modi-over-suicide-note-joke-calls-it-insensitive-501536) with sourcing done through quotes without hyperlinking. In general, more stories favor the right and utilize poor sourcing techniques.
