History
[Founded in 2012](https://whois.domaintools.com/federalistpress.com), The Federalist Press is a conservative news opinion website. According to their [mission page](http://federalistpress.com/mission), “Federalist Press is dedicated to providing its readers with up-to-date political commentary and analysis on a wide variety important issues facing our nation, with such analysis being based on classic founding principles as outlined in The Constitution of the United States of America, The Federalist Papers, and other explanations supplied by the Founding Fathers of the Republic.”
The website lacks transparency as it does not disclose the editor, authors, owners, or funding.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Federalist Press anonymously publishes news and information loosely related to the constitution. The website posts the Federalist Papers, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. They also publish news that always favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this:
[Maddow Called Trump’s Claim About Navy Medical Ships ‘Nonsense.’ Wrong Again](http://federalistpress.com/maddow-called-trumps-claim-about-navy-medical-ships-nonsense-wrong-again.php). This story is properly sourced to [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) and [NPR.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) Another example of emotionally loaded language that favors the right is [BOMBSHELL: FBI Discussed Interviewing Michael Flynn ‘to get him to lie’ and ‘get him fired,’ Handwritten Show.](http://federalistpress.com/bombshell-fbi-discussed-interviewing-michael-flynn-to-get-him-to-lie-and-get-him-fired-handwritten-notes-show.php) Again, this story is reasonably sourced. In general, story selection always favors the right and sometimes uses factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). However, there is zero information about this website or the authors of the content.
