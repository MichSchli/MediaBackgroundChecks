Analysis / Bias
In review, AL DÍA uses emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Bolton symbolizes U.S. arrogance towards Latin America”](https://aldianews.com/articles/politics/opinion/bolton-symbolizes-us-arrogance-towards-latin-america/55429) and “ [Trump, Kushner and the new anti-immigrant agenda.”](https://aldianews.com/articles/politics/immigration/trump-kushner-and-new-anti-immigrant-agenda/55475) The body of this article contains a strong anti-Trump tone such as this:
“While the president keeps the country obsessed with the Mueller Report, his closest advisers – and relatives – decide on the new immigration policies in the country.”
In another article, there is a neutral headline that reads
[“Bernie Sanders’ strategy to engage Latino voters,”](https://aldianews.com/articles/politics/elections/bernie-sanders-strategy-engage-latino-voters/55473) however, the author clearly favors Bernie Sanders:
“Medicare-For-All, tuition-free education, a Green New Deal … these proposals, which in the past would have been discarded at first glance, have become the bread and butter of a United States deeply divided among those who still believe in the Republican format and those who demand a Democratic Party up to the new challenges.”
When it comes to sourcing information, straight news articles are properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). However, opinion pieces often lack proper sourcing or link back to other Al DIA articles. Editorially, most op-eds are left-leaning, and Al DIA does not have a separate category for opinion pieces but rather publishes them side by side with straight news. This is confusing and misleading as op-eds are always strongly left-biased and one-sided.
