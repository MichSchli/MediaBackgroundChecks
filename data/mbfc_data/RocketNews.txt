Funded by / Ownership
Murray Owen owns RocketNews through Murray Owen LLC. The website does not display ads; however, revenue is derived through sponsored content or what they refer to as “commercial news posts.”
[Commercial Posts](https://www.rocketnews.com/services/) typically advertise a product or website that is pre-paid at $100 for one article, $200 for three articles, and $300 for six articles. RocketNews disclaims, “We reserve the right to refuse service to websites we deem inappropriate, objectionable, or used for spam or other questionable ethical purposes other than best practices defined by the major search engines. If your content is deemed inappropriate, we’ll refund your money in full.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, RocketNews features two primary sections, one dedicated to aggregated news from other sources and the other to “features articles,” which lists commercial posts. Aggregated news comes primarily from
[Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/) and [Yahoo News,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/) which we rate Left-Center Biased. Other sources used less frequently are the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and local news affiliates.
Paid Commercial Posts generally promote services or products through articles such as this:
[What Materials Are Needed to Repair a Roof?](https://www.rocketnews.com/2020/06/what-materials-are-needed-to-repair-a-roof/) While the article is informative and helpful, the purpose of this article is to drive traffic to a [roof repairs service](https://legacyusa.com/blog/roofing-repair-and-replacement-services/) website. Although most of the content is harmless and informative, some do not provide a source and advocate unproven claims such as this: [5 High Protein Vegetables For Weight Loss](https://www.rocketnews.com/2019/05/5-high-protein-vegetables-for-weight-loss/). This article does not source scientific evidence that the claims made have been proven. In general, RocketNews does not express editorial positions; however, most news sources fall along the left-leaning spectrum.
