Analysis / Bias
In review, I Heart Intelligence is a website that publishes a combination of real scientific/technology news and questionable pseudoscience. For example, they will publish a feel-good true story such as this:
[Bon Jovi Opens Third Community Restaurant To Serve Food To People In Need](https://iheartintelligence.com/bon-jovi-opens-third-community-restaurant-serve-food-people-in-need/) or a credible science-based article [Eggs From The Last Two Northern White Rhinos Successfully Fertilized](https://iheartintelligence.com/eggs-from-last-two-northern-white-rhinos-successfully-fertilized/).
Although there is credible information on this website, there is also a moderate amount of pseudoscience. For example, they promote
[natural cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) such as this [Why Un-Boiling An Egg Could Be The Cancer Treatment Breakthrough Of The Decade](https://iheartintelligence.com/unboiling-egg-cancer-treatment/). They also frequently publish [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/); in fact, they have an [Anti-Gmo tag](https://iheartintelligence.com/tag/anti-gmo/) to filter stories. In general, I heart Intelligence publishes mostly credible information; however, some content does not align with the consensus of science and is considered pseudoscience.
