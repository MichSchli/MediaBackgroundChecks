Analysis / Bias
In review, the Babylon Bee clearly identifies themselves as satire through their tagline. In general, the satire on this website is directed at Christians and Conservatives such as this:
[Local Man Fires Off Flare Gun Inside Hobby Lobby To Locate Wife](https://babylonbee.com/news/local-man-fires-off-flare-gun-inside-hobby-lobby), and this [Local Christian Squeezes In Quick, Silent Prayer Before Telling Friend, ‘I’m Praying For You](https://babylonbee.com/news/local-christian-squeezes-in-quick-silent-prayer-before-telling-friend-im-praying-for-you).’ They also enjoy poking fun at former President Trump: [Trump Announces Illegal Immigrant Gladiator Games](https://babylonbee.com/news/trump-announces-illegal-immigrant-gladiator-games). On the whole, they would most appeal to a Christian/conservative audience; however, those of a secular bent will also enjoy the irony implied here.
