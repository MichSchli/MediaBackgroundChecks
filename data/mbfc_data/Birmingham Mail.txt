Analysis / Bias
In review, the Birmingham Mail uses loaded language in its headlines and articles. They poorly source or don’t provide links such as:
[“Campaign to ban Donald Trump from Birmingham resumes after President shares extremist anti-Muslim propaganda.](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/campaign-ban-donald-trump-birmingham-13975113)” They use factually mixed sources such as the [Daily Mirror when they link to sources.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mirror/) Many of the headlines are highly sensationalized, such as this: “ [XXXX rated study claims sex in old age could make you more intelligent](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/sex-xxxx-active-old-age-13224155).”
Politically, more articles favor the left than the right, such as this
[Boris Johnson was accused of squeezing thigh of woman at boozy lunch](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/boris-johnson-accused-squeezing-thigh-17002656). Story selection and editorial positions favor the left and utilize strong, loaded wording; however, news reporting is generally factual.
