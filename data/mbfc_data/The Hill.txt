Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hill covers both sides on the political spectrum and generally sources information properly; however, they sometimes rush stories and have to change them after the fact. The Hill rarely uses loaded words in their headlines and articles such as this:
[Trump says he won’t sign GOP’s compromise immigration bill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/392439-trump-says-he-wont-sign-gops-compromise-immigration-bill). All news stories are sourced from either journalists or credible media sources.
The Hill features editorial commentaries that provide a reasonably balanced group of columnists that consists of the following:
[Brent Budowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Budowsky)( [Leans Left](https://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/463931-brent-budowsky-deep-throats-defending-our-democracy)) [Lanny Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanny_Davis)( [Leans Left](https://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/462680-lanny-j-davis-what-about-the-facts-about-hunter-biden)) [John Feehery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Feehery)( [Leans Right](https://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/452091-feehery-the-lefts-patriotism-problem)) [Mark Mellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Political_Consultants)( [Slightly Left](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/437788-trump-is-all-bark-no-bite-on-repairing-crumbling-roads-and-bridges)) [Katie Pavlich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Pavlich)( [Leans Right](https://thehill.com/opinion/katie-pavlich/463930-katie-pavlich-the-frauds-of-the-climate-change-movement)) [Bill Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Press)( [Leans Left)](https://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/462679-bill-press-ukraine-is-the-final-straw-for-trump) [David Webb](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Webb_(writer)&action=edit&redlink=1)( [Leans Right](https://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/455418-webb-trump-delivers-sharpton-does-photo-ops))
The Hill also features other outside opinion contributors such as Newt Gingrich, among other prominent figures. The general overall tone of all op-eds is currently balanced after dominant right-leaning voice John Solomon left the paper in October 2019.
The Hill has faced criticism for the hiring of John Solomon. He is described as a strong supporter of President Trump and a
[conspiracy theorist](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-invention-of-the-conspiracy-theory-on-biden-and-ukraine), with his previous opinion columns [under review](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/18/the-hill-review-john-solomon-ukraine-pieces-071345) for false content. Further, [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/media/jimmy-finkelstein-the-hill-ukraine/index.html) indicate that owner Jimmy Finkelstein “kept a watchful eye on the newspaper’s coverage to ensure it is not too critical of the President.”
News reporting is generally balanced and factual with a reasonably balanced Op-Ed page.
Failed Fact Checks
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=thehill&gsc.sort=) reveals The Hill has not failed any fact checks. However, they have rushed to publish breaking news that needed to be corrected or removed in the past. The Hill also published editorial commentary that has been labeled conspiratorial by other sources; however, this columnist is no longer with the paper.
