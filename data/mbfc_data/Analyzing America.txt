Analysis / Bias
In review, Analyzing America publishes summarized news stories from other sources. It utilizes loaded emotional headlines like
[GOP Red: ‘People Are Getting Hurt’ Because of de Blasio’s ‘Feckless Leadership](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/gop-red-people-are-getting-hurt-because-of-de-blasios-feckless-leadership/).’ This story completely lacks hyperlinked sourcing. Story selection always favors the right and often denigrates the left, such as [INSANE: Liberals Blame Trump for Rise in Antisemitism in Wake of Hanukkah Stabbing Attack](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/insane-liberals-blame-trump-for-rise-in-antisemitism-in-wake-of-hanukkah-stabbing-attack/). This story is sourced to the questionable [Breitbart News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Regarding sourcing, they sometimes do not provide hyperlinks and, in other cases, use
[far-right biased](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/bombshell-paul-pelosi-nancys-son-under-scrutiny-for-shady-dealings-in-ukraine/), questionable sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). Analyzing America also promotes [conspiracy theories](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/watch-hillary-clinton-laughs-creepily-after-trevor-noah-asked-her-how-she-killed-jeffrey-epstein/) regarding the Clintons and [pro-Trump propaganda](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/ex-nfl-player-says-black-awakening-will-help-trump-win-in-2020/). In general, this is a far-right biased website that lacks credibility.
