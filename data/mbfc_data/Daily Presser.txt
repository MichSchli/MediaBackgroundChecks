Analysis / Bias
The Daily Presser is an extreme Alt-Right news and opinion blog. Every article favors the right and denigrates the left. Daily Presser uses
[loaded words](http://www.dailypresser.com/2017/08/12590/) in headlines and in the articles themselves. Although Daily Presser attempts to source information, it usually comes from right wing sources or questionable sources such as [Freedom Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-daily/) or the Questionable [American Patriot](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-patriot-daily/). In [one particular article](http://www.dailypresser.com/2017/08/lies-liberals-confederate-flag-civil-war-kkk/) they make the claim that the Civil War was fought over states rights and not slavery. This has been [thoroughly debunked](https://qz.com/378533/for-the-last-time-the-american-civil-war-was-not-about-states-rights/) by historians as the states right’s they were primarily fighting for was to continue slavery with each [constitution](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp) of the Confederate States mentioning this.
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=dailypresser.com&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals the the Daily Presser has never been fact checked, this is due to the fact that they usually republish stories and offer little original content. The sources used by the Daily Presser have a very poor track record with fact checker and are all far or extreme right in bias.
