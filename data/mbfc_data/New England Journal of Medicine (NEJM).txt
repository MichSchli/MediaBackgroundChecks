[Osimertinib Adjuvant Therapy in EGFR-Mutated NSCLC Y.-L. Wu and Others](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027071?query=featured_home) and [ Neutralizing-Antibody Therapy in Covid-19 P. Chen and Others](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2029849?query=featured_home).
The New England Journal of Medicine also publishes editorials that favor science and consensus. For example, in October 2020, the journal
[published an editorial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/health/new-england-journal-trump.html), signed by all 34 editors, in which they condemned the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that “they are dangerously incompetent” and that “they have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.” This is the first time the journal has ever supported or condemned a political candidate and only three other times in history has an editorial been signed by all the editors. Further, they sometimes publish special reports that involve politics, such as this: [Implications of the 2020 Election for U.S. Health Policy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr2031592?query=featured_home). In general, all information published by NEJM is Highly Factual.
