Analysis / Bias
In review, Intrepid report publishes news through independent authors with a strong liberal bias in reporting. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language that denigrates the right such as this:
[Trump’s POS labor secretary, Acosta, out; POS number 2, linked to Abramoff, to fill role](http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/27587). Despite the use of highly biased language, the article itself is well written and properly sourced to High factual sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and [Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/).
Editorially, the Intrepid Report always favors the left through
[policy endorsement](http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/20669) and word choices. When it comes to science, they support the consensus on [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but [do not](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) regarding the [safety of GMO’s](http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/25188). They generally report news and opinions from a left-leaning perspective 100% of the time.
