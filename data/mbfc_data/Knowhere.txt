Analysis / Bias
In review, Knowhere presents daily news stories written as Impartial (without loaded wording – covering both sides fairly), Left and Right-leaning. They also provide links to other sources of varying biases that are reporting the same story. The impartial stories are dry and factual as one would expect, while the right and left-leaning interpretations of the story are more colorful and unbalanced. The concept of the site is unique and serves to educate media consumers of the difference between biased (spinned) media reporting and that which is not.
