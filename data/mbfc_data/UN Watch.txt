History
[Launched in 1993](https://www.unwatch.org/about-us/mission-history/), UN Watch is a non-governmental organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, that monitors the performance of the United Nations and its adherence to its charter. Ambassador Alfred H. Moses serves as Chair for Un Watch, and Hillel Neuer is the Executive Director.
UN Watch was founded by
[Morris Berthold Abram,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Berthold_Abram) civil rights activist and former U.S. Honorary President of the American Jewish Committee, [focusing on](http://secure.unwatch.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1314451&ct=1766305) “monitoring the continuing discriminatory treatment of Israel in the UN system and attitudes toward Jews in the world body as well as those matters which concern American interests.“ [Read our profile on Switzerland’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/switzerland-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
According to
[Sourcewatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/UN_Watch#cite_note-4), the UN Watch lobby is for the removal of UN personnel who are considered critical of Israel: [“US calls for resignation of UN’s Richard Falk Special rapporteur for Palestinian territories said NGO UN Watch should be investigated to ensure it’s not controlled by Israel”](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-calls-for-resignation-of-uns-richard-falk/) Further, according to Sourcewatch, UN Watch also is funded by the [American Jewish Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee) since 2001.
Analysis / Bias
A former UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, praises UN Watch. The
[Economist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economist/) describes UN Watch as a “ [Geneva-based pro-Israeli monitor](https://www.economist.com/news/international/21722827-despite-its-flaws-organisation-helps-make-world-better-place-un-human-rights).” In contrast, [Right web](http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/un_watch/) describes UN Watch’s political stance as “UN Watch has repeatedly been accused of having a staunchly “pro-Israel” bias and an outlook on Middle East peace that is closely aligned with that of Israel’s right-wing Likud Party.”
In review, UN Watch has a strong use of loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles, such as
[“UN Clash: China Fails to Silence UN Watch Dissident Yang Jianli](https://www.unwatch.org/chinas-un-rep-spies-dissident-interrupts-un-testimony-three-times/)” and “ [U.N. in Shock: Heads Turn in Stunned Disbelief as Palestinian Exposes PLO Lies, Watch heads turn & eyes bulge](https://www.unwatch.org/donate/)!”
UN Watch utilizes credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and usun.state.gov; however, they also utilize factually Questionable sources such as [Cnsnews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/) and the [Daily Wire.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/) Story selection mostly favors Israel and holds the same positions as the former right-wing [government of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud).
