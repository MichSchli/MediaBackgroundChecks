Analysis / Bias
In review, McClatchyDC covers Washington DC and national politics using McClatchy reporters. A review of articles shows that many headlines contain moderately loaded language that tends to favor the left such as these:
[California Republicans fear even bigger trouble ahead for their wounded party](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article223378470.html), and [Trump administration wants huge limits on food stamps — even though Congress said ‘no’.](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article223327800.html) All stories published use proper hyperlinked sourcing to credible media and/or Government information. McClatchyDC does not have an actual editorial page; however, they do have an [editorial cartoon page](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/opinion/editorial-cartoons/) that almost always paints former President Trump and the GOP negatively.
