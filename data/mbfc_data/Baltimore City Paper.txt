Analysis / Bias
Baltimore City Paper reports on concerts, visual arts, restaurants, and events, focusing on Baltimore City and Baltimore County. There are also several political and advice columns. Its editorials generally tend to lean left utilizing loaded headlines such as “
[Charlottesville](http://www.citypaper.com/bcpnews-charlottesville-and-the-shattering-of-america-20170813-story.html) and the shattering of America.” The Baltimore City Paper primarily writes left-leaning opinion pieces and offers very little sourcing to support their claims.
However, with a change in ownership with known ties to conservative causes, it is not yet clear what impact it will have on the
[editorial direction](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/economy/baltimore-sun-david-smith-sinclair-owner-F77S3D47ORD7LNEPZ7PJCXSLWM/?fbclid=IwAR3_MuBhzSbK9xdMBm7z20U9YgS6yx5S3Ay5KEf4KYLD3J3GVIw1DIlrieE) of the Baltimore City Paper. For example, [Tax records show](https://wtop.com/baltimore/2024/01/the-baltimore-sun-is-returning-to-local-ownership-with-a-buyer-who-has-made-his-politics-clear/) Smith’s foundation has donated to the conservative group [Project Veritas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-veritas/), which is best known for making hidden camera stings on media and liberal figures.
