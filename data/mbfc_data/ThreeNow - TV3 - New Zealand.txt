Analysis / Bias
TV3 – New Zealand publishes news via the
[Newshub](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newshub-bias/) website with strong, emotionally loaded words, such as: [“Who Mayor Wayne Brown was calling, texting as Auckland flooded.”](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/03/who-mayor-wayne-brown-was-calling-texting-as-auckland-flooded.html) Mayor Brown is the [center-right](https://www.1news.co.nz/2022/10/08/centre-right-wayne-brown-to-become-aucklands-new-mayor/) Mayor of Auckland. He has been criticized for the delay in declaring a state of emergency as Auckland flooded. A quote from the article reads, “Newshub has obtained a log of calls and text messages Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown made on the day New Zealand’s largest city experienced widespread flooding.”
Other examples of loaded language include:
[“Ministry for Environment slammed by ACT Party for spending $913,000 on flights in 11 months,”](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2023/03/ministry-for-environment-slammed-by-act-party-for-spending-913-000-on-flights-in-11-months.html) and [“New Zealanders rank inflation, cost of living as most important issue country faces.”](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2023/02/new-zealanders-rank-inflation-cost-of-living-as-most-important-issue-country-faces.html)
Regarding sourcing, TV3 – New Zealand utilizes credible sources such as
[IPSOS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ipsos-polling/) and [environment.govt.nz ](https://environment.govt.nz/assets/publications/OIAD-488-Redacted.pdf) through quotes and images; however, they often don’t provide hyperlinks; therefore, it is difficult to verify the claims. Further, their poll reporting has been criticized, such as in this opinion piece where it is accused of bias, [“Opinion: Newshub’s biased poll reporting.”](https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/opinion-newshubs-biased-poll-reporting/)
In general, TV3 – New Zealand is mostly factual based on not always sourcing properly and a failed fact check. They also hold left-leaning editorial positions such as this
[Nearly two thirds of Kiwi LGBTQ+ travellers suffer negative holiday experiences – report](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/travel/2022/08/nearly-two-thirds-of-kiwi-lgbtq-travellers-suffer-negative-travel-experiences-report.html).
