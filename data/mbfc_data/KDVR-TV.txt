History
[Founded in 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR), KDVR-TV is a [Fox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/)-affiliated television station based in Denver, Colorado. KDVR.com is the official website for the TV station that publishes news, sports, and information about programming. While the website has an [about page](https://kdvr.com/contact/), it does not provide information about the content they produce, nor name editorial leadership or adequately disclose ownership. In general, there is a lack of transparency. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The only disclosure of ownership is found at the very bottom of the page with a link to
[NEXSTAR BROADCASTING, INC](https://www.nexstar.tv/)., which is the largest television station owner in the United States, owning [197 television stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexstar_Media_Group) across the U.S., most of which are affiliated with the four “major” U.S. television networks located in small to medium-sized markets. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, KDVR.com publishes news, sports, traffic, and weather concerning the Denver metro area and surrounding suburbs. Headlines and articles for local news are minimally biased, such as at
[ least one officer involved in shooting near 92nd and Federal](https://kdvr.com/2019/12/06/at-least-one-officer-involved-in-shooting-near-92nd-and-federal/). National and world news is delivered from various sources such as [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and Tribune Media Wire.
Editorially, KDVR does not offer Op-Eds; however, they report on political news with a reasonable balance between political parties. Further, when reporting on top political figures, there is minimal use of loaded wording such as this:
[Pelosi OKs drafting articles of impeachment against President Trump](https://kdvr.com/2019/12/05/pelosi-oks-drafting-articles-of-impeachment-against-president-trump/). In general, they report news factually and with minimal bias.
