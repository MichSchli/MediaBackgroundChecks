History
Founded in 2004 by former anti-fascist journalist Nick Lowles,
[Hope Not Hate](https://hopenothate.org.uk/about-us/) combats racism, fascism, and extremism in the UK. Initially the campaigning arm of Searchlight Magazine, it broke away in 2011.
They stand out for their unique approach. Instead of traditional confrontation tactics, they understand and address the concerns of those drawn to extremism, offering hope and positive alternatives. The organization emerged in response to the rise of the
[British National Party (BNP)](https://hopenothate.org.uk/about-us/our-story/) in 2001. Its name, “HOPE Not Hate,” reflects its strategy of engaging with BNP voters’ grievances and offering messages of hope as a counter to hate and conventional anti-fascist rhetoric.

Analysis / Bias
HOPE Not Hate primarily counters far-right politics and hate through various initiatives. Its campaigns, clearly opposing far-right ideologies, emphasize positive messaging over aggression or divisiveness. We now analyze some of their reports.
HOPE Not Hate’s report
[“Stoking the Flames: The Influence of Press and Government Rhetoric on far-right anti-migrant Engagement”](https://hopenothate.org.uk/2023/05/21/stoking_the_flames/) examines the relationship between government rhetoric, media coverage, and the rise in far-right anti-migrant sentiment. It features emotionally loaded language, especially in criticizing government policies and media reporting, which it argues intensifies far-right extremism.
The report suggests a direct link between governmental and media narratives about migration and increased far-right activity, framing the government as contributing to the problem. The use of terms like “weaponized” and “architects of a broken asylum system” indicates a strong, critical stance. While it cites specific data and events to support its claims, the language and framing reflect a clear bias against the government’s migration policies and certain media portrayals. The report includes examples of headlines from British tabloids such as
[The Sun UK](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-sun/) and [Daily Express](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-express/), further illustrating its points. The report, including detailed analyses and examples, is available for [download](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stoking-the-Flames.pdf) within the article. [The article “Rishi Sunak meets Giorgia Meloni”](https://hopenothate.org.uk/2023/09/13/rishi-sunak-meets-giorgia-meloni/) expresses concern over the UK Conservative Party’s direction, highlighting the meeting between [UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rishi-sunak-united-kingdom-facts-and-bias/) and [Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/giorgia-meloni-italy-facts-and-bias/). It describes Meloni’s party, Brothers of Italy, as far-right and neo-fascist, criticizing her anti-LGBT+ stance and migration policies. The article uses emotive language to emphasize the perceived dangers of aligning with Meloni, suggesting that such alliances could mainstream extreme right-wing politics. The tone is alarmist, framing the Conservative Party’s immigration discussions with Meloni as a worrying shift towards far-right ideologies. The article’s language and framing indicate a clear bias against these political developments. Regarding sources, they cite [ spectator.co.uk](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-spectator-uk/), [ BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/23/europe/meloni-italy-migrants-politics-intl/index.html), [Euronews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/euronews/), and [Politico Europe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico-europe-bias/).
In general, Hope Not Hate holds progressive left editorial and advocacy biases while consistently publishing fact-based information.
