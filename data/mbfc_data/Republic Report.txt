Analysis / Bias
In review, the Republic Report is focused on money in politics as well as education. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[DeVos’s Absurd Attack On For-Profit College’s Sudden Shutdown](https://www.republicreport.org/2018/devoss-absurd-attack-on-for-profit-colleges-sudden-shutdown/), however, this article is properly sourced to credible media outlets and institutions. In another article, there is significant use of loaded language that is not favorable toward former President Trump: [Trump Terrible 10: What the Actual FFFF Edition](https://www.republicreport.org/2018/trump-terrible-10-what-the-actual-ffff-edition/). Again, this article is also properly sourced. In general, all stories published on Republic Report favor the left and denigrate the right.
