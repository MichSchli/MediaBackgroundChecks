Analysis / Bias
In review, the website publishes articles from a legal perspective related to national security issues. Articles typically feature minimal to moderate loaded language such as this:
[The Potential Trouble with Nominating a DNI from Trump’s Central Casting](https://www.lawfareblog.com/potential-trouble-nominating-dni-trumps-central-casting). This story is properly sourced to the President’s daily briefs and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). All articles reviewed are properly sourced from credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), Justice.gov, and the [New York Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/)
Although Lawfare is known for its straight factual reporting, they also produce editorial content that frequently discusses former
[President Trump’s legal issues](https://www.lawfareblog.com/just-security-posts-trumps-executive-order-refugees-and-immigration) and policy that may not be constitutional. This reporting is always evidence-based. In general, Lawfare is factual and utilizes minimal personal bias as they do not take sides. They report on the law and how it impacts national security.
