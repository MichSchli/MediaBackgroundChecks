Analysis / Bias
In review, OilPrice reports on global crude oil prices and general energy news. Headlines and articles are usually low-biased in wording such as this:
[Shell, Exxon Close Deal To Build Five LNG Import Terminals](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Shell-Exxon-Close-Deal-To-Build-Five-LNG-Import-Terminals.html). Like most articles, this is appropriately sourced to credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). In general, OilPrice sticks exactly to what they claim, which is the energy industry.
However, we have found that editorial and opinion pieces favor the right and utilize loaded emotional language such as this quote “China, which is now directly benefiting at the expense of US consumers as a result of Biden’s escalating panic to undo the consequences of his catastrophic green policies by selling the most valuable US assets directly to Beijing!” This
[opinion piece](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-Is-The-US-Sending-Its-Emergency-Oil-Reserves-To-China.html?fbclid=IwAR1bTIARcwKrftYPMOilvLPDJtXF1swdBnvK-KxdEoyPi28-FHVIMOrbgTM) is republished from the far-right conspiracy website [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), which has failed numerous fact checks.
OilPrice reports on politics only as it relates to energy and often with balance and minimal bias, such as this:
[Trump Clashes With California Over Fuel Regulations](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trump-Clashes-With-California-Over-Fuel-Regulations.html). Regarding science, OilPrice does not make any statements regarding [climate change](https://oilprice.com/search/tab/articles/climate_change). Though they frequently report on alternative energy, such as this: [Amazon Makes The Largest Ever Electric Vehicle Purchase](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Amazon-Makes-The-Largest-Ever-Electric-Vehicle-Purchase.html). In general, OilPrice does exactly what it claims: to report on Oil Prices and the energy sector. However, op-eds tend to favor the right and occasionally use poor sources.
