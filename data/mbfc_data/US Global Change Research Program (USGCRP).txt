History
[The US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)](https://globalchange.gov/about-us) was created in 1990 under the US Global Change Research Act and is located in Washington, DC. The USGCRP brings together and oversees federal research on how the Earth’s environment changes and how these changes affect people. Formerly called the [Climate Change Science Program,](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13330/chapter/3) USGCRP coordinates and shapes research for public health, safety, economic competitiveness, and environmental sustainability issues.

Funded by / Ownership
USGCRP is a federal program coordinating research on global environmental changes and their societal impacts. It is funded by 14 federal agencies and has a
[budget ](https://globalchange.gov/about-us)of $5.139 billion for Fiscal Year 2023.
Analysis / Bias
USGCRP’s mission is to empower the nation and the world to respond to climate and global change risks by creating accessible, usable knowledge. It emphasizes a science-driven approach to meet global change challenges.
The program’s vision is for a nation guided by science to confront climate and global change for the benefit of all. For example, an article titled
[“The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment”](https://health2016.globalchange.gov/climate-change-and-human-health) presents a comprehensive scientific assessment of how climate change is a significant threat to the health of the American people. The assessment integrates extensive scientific data and literature reviews, demonstrating a strong pro-science perspective. USGCRP’s use of well-known and trusted sources like the National Climate Assessment and EPA reports shows they are thorough and accurate in their research on climate change.
USGCRP has also faced criticism for its reactive approach to climate change education and workforce development. Critics like
[Christina Kwauk and Joseph W. Kane](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/empowering-the-us-global-change-research-program-to-further-climate-education-and-training/#:~:text=,com%E3%80%91%20%0A%0AMarch%201%2C%202021) from [Brookings](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/) note that USGCRP tends to respond to immediate needs rather than proactively developing comprehensive educational programs, especially K-12 education. They also highlight the significant absence of the Department of Education and the Department of Labor from USGCRP’s framework, arguing that this omission hinders the development of an effective green learning agenda.
Despite criticism of its educational programs, USGCRP is highly credible and factual in its climate change research due to its strong scientific foundation and data-driven approach. While a federal government entity, its work is based on scientific evidence and data, without a clear bias in research output. Its goals and methodologies are driven by scientific inquiry and factual evidence, not political positions, despite the politicization of climate change.
