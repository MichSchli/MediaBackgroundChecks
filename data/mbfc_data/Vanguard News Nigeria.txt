Analysis / Bias
Vanguard News provides articles that cover both news and opinion pieces. The articles are generally well-written and neutral in tone. For example, an article about the International Monetary Fund raising the alarm over rising inflation in Nigeria is presented with factual information and quotes from relevant authorities.
Editorially, we found that more articles favor the left-leaning ruling party, such as this:
[Tinubu waives ‘no work, no pay’ policy for resident doctors](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/10/tinubu-grants-waiver-to-resident-doctors-on-no-work-no-pay-policy/). While this article is fact-based, it discusses a policy waiver granted by Tinubu for resident doctors, which could be seen as a favorable action by the ruling party. In general, more stories favor the left, and some have promoted misinformation.
