History
Founded in 2017, AltRight.com is a Virginia based Alt-Right blog run by
[Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer) and [Daniel Friberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Friberg). The intent of the site according to their [about page](https://altright.com/) is “AltRight.com brings together the best writers and analysts from the Alt-Right, in North America, Europe, and around the world.”
AltRight.com publishes stories under the categories of Culture, Perspective, and Policy. They also broadcast propaganda videos under the category
[show](https://altright.com/2018/04/15/divided-we-fall/) and have a category called AltRight Plus, which is a subscription based membership area.
Richard Spencer, according to his
[interview](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/) with [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) titled “His Kampf ”stated “The long-term goal, is the establishment of a “post-American” white “ethno-state,” through a slow process of awakening ethnic pride and instituting government policies that reflect a new white race consciousness.”
Richard Spencer was a supporter of
[President Donald Trump](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/richard-spencer-speech-npi/508379/) during the 2016 election. However, Spencer is now critical of President Trump due to his interventionist foreign policy, such as: [“Stay Out Of Syria.“](https://altright.com/2018/04/14/stay-out-of-syria/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, AltRight.com utilizes emotionally loaded language both in their headlines and in their articles
[such as](https://altright.com/2018/04/14/stay-out-of-syria/) “Donald Trump has, sadly, failed to fulfill his potential as an agent of change.” They often publish articles with sensational headlines using loaded language such as [“Ted Cruz and the Circle of Political Cuckoldry”](https://altright.com/2016/03/28/ted-cruz-and-the-circle-of-political-cuckoldry/) and “ [We are going to take down the Globo-Corpo-Homo-Judeo Industrial Complex.](https://altright.com/2017/08/18/the-alt-right-is-at-war-with-corporate-america/)” Typically, AltRight.com utilizes discredited sources such as the [dailymail.co.uk](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) and conspiracy sites such as [zerohedge.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), and questionable sources such as [dangerandplay.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/danger-and-play/) and [GotNews.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gotnews/)
AltRight.com also republishes stories from the questionable
[National Policy Institute,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-policy-institute/) which is a white supremacist think tank based in Alexandria, Virginia and founded by William Regnery II.
Further,
[The Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0) describes Richard Spencer as a “leading academic racist” and the [National Policy Institute](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/groups) as a hate group.
As of this update they have not published a new article in over 1 year, but still have an internet presence.
