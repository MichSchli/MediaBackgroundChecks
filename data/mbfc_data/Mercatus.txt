History
[Founded in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercatus_Center), The Mercatus Center at George Mason University is an American non-profit free-market-oriented research, education, and outreach think tank directed by [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen). The Center was founded by [Richard H. Fink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Fink) as the Center for the Study of Market Processes at Rutgers University. After the Koch family gave more than [$30 million](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Mercatus_Center) to George Mason University, the Center moved there in the mid-1980s. It took its current name in 1999. [The mission](https://www.mercatus.org/about) of Mercatus is to be “the world’s premier university source for market-oriented ideas” and says it aims to bridge “the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
According to their about page “Mercatus researchers conduct
[research](https://www.mercatus.org/research), work with [graduate students](https://asp.mercatus.org/) to apply ideas to problems in the world, and make research findings available to the [media](https://www.mercatus.org/newsroom) and to policymakers to connect academic learning with real-world practice.”
In review, the Mercatus Center does not use emotional language in headlines or articles such as this:
[Strengthening the US Economy through a US-UK Trade Agreement.](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/trade-and-immigration/strengthening-us-economy-through-us-uk-trade-agreement) This article is properly sourced to highly credible sources such as the World Trade Organization, the Census Bureau, and the US International Trade Commission. Story selection takes a strongly free-market position such as this: [0%: The Correct Corporate Tax Rate](https://www.mercatus.org/commentary/0-correct-corporate-tax-rate). This story is directly republished from [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). Mercatus also [endorses](https://ppe.mercatus.org/?_ga=2.242914498.1399149139.1547336223-78225475.1547336223) Austrian Economic Theory, with the Austrian School of Economics first coining the term [anarcho-capitalism](https://mises.org/library/can-anarcho-capitalism-work).
When it comes to science, Mercatus is skeptical of
[Government based solutions](https://www.mercatus.org/search/google/climate%20change) for [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but does not deny that it is human-caused and in line with the consensus of science.
In general, Mercatus always favors Free-Market solutions but is evidence-based in their research.
