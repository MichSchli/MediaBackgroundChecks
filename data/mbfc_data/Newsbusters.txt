History
Founded in 2005, Newsbusters claims to expose liberal bias much like its parent organization
[Media Research Center.](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-research-center-mrc/) The website features a tagline that reads “dedicated to exposing & combating liberal media bias.” Essentially, this site reports on perceived liberal bias in the media and by individuals. According to their [about page](https://www.newsbusters.org/about), they state “the NewsBusters blog provides immediate exposure of national media bias, unfairness, inaccuracy, and occasional idiocy.”
The parent organization, Media Research Center (MRC), was founded in 1987 by
[L. Brent Bozell III](https://www.newsbusters.org/author/brent-bozell). MRC claims to be “America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing, and neutralizing liberal media bias.”
On 12/18/2019, Newsbusters published a misleading criticism of Media Bias Fact Check, stating, “MediaBiasFactCheck.com has one section labeled “
[Questionable Sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/),” which includes neo-Nazi publications such as [The Daily Stormer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-stormer/), but also slams reputable conservative outlets: [DNC Starts Disinformation ‘Intelligence Unit’ To Combat Drudge, CNSNews.com](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/techwatch/corinne-weaver/2019/12/17/dnc-starts-disinformation-intelligence-unit-combat-drudge).” While it is a fact that there are numerous conservative/far-right sources on our questionable list, Newsbusters failed to mention the dozens of left-wing sources on this list, such as [Occupy Democrats](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/occupy-democrats/), [Bipartisan Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bipartisan-report/), [Blue Dot Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/blue-dot-daily/), etc. This story clearly illustrates the bias and misleading nature of Newsbusters and why this is a borderline Questionable source.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsbusters reports news on liberal bias. They frequently use strongly loaded, emotional, and right-biased wording such as this:
[CBS’s Garrett Hammers NBC for Boosting Warren During Debate](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kyle-drennen/2019/06/27/cbss-garrett-hammers-nbc-boosting-warren-during-debate). This story is sourced from video footage and tweets. Another example of emotionally charged language is [NBC’s Liberal Debate Obsessions: Save Miami! Grab Guns! Fight Mitch McConnell!](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/scott-whitlock/2019/06/26/nbcs-liberal-debate-questions-save-miami-grab-guns-fight-mitch) Regarding sourcing, they usually provide videos to support their opinions; however, they use poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). Editorially, Newsbusters always favors conservatives and denigrates the left.
