Analysis / Bias
BoredPanda.com’s goal is to share positive news and showcase global artists through user-submitted and staff-written articles. The website’s content is organized into numerous categories and presented in written, photographic, and video formats, covering various topics such as art, animals, parenting, and history.
Articles and headlines contain sensational wording in an attempt to have the stories go viral on social media, such as this:
[50 People Having A Terrible Day (New Pics)](https://www.boredpanda.com/people-having-worse-day-than-you-pics/). Most articles are sourced from social media, and Bored Panda claims to contact the sources for verification.
Editorially, Bored Panda does not take direct political positions; however, there are more articles portraying former President Trump negatively and current Democratic President Joe Biden favorably, such as this
[People Are Celebrating The Transition From Trump To Biden In 34 Funny Posts](https://www.boredpanda.com/biden-trump-white-house-transition-jokes/). A quote from the article reads, “Say goodbye to Trump-approved Twitter storms, insults, and constant bla bla bla, much of which with very questionable content.” Generally, Bored Panda is mostly factual and editorially holds a moderate left-leaning bias.
