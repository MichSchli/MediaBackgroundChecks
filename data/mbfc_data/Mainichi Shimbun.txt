Analysis / Bias
In Japan, The Prime Minister is the head of government. The current Prime Minister is
[Fumio Kishida](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/japan-media-profile/), the leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and known for his nationalistic conservatism. Japan also uses a “ [Press Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_and_politics_in_Japan)” system, which may compromise the independence of the press.
In review, although Mainichi Shimbun states the author’s name at the end of most articles, they do not provide biographical information regarding the author or the editor. Furthermore, articles are poorly sourced; for example, a quote from an
[article](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190619/p2g/00m/0fe/082000c#cxrecs_s) reads: “Governments of all types across Japan have begun campaigns to encourage foreign tourists to purchase travel insurance, with a recent surge in people leaving unpaid medical bills putting pressure on Japanese hospital budgets.” This statement is not hyperlinked to a source that supports the claim. However, when they do source information, they use credible sources such as the Tokyo City News Department or their own national bureaus and for [international news coverage](https://mainichi.jp/english/world/) they utilize the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)

When covering world news pertaining to the USA, articles are generally written with a neutral tone, such as
[“Trump to inspect Japanese destroyer with Abe in late May](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190509/p2g/00m/0na/006000c),” and again they tend not to hyperlink.
