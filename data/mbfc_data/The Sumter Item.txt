Analysis / Bias
In review, The Sumter Item reports local news via journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Sumter school board holding called meeting Tuesday night](https://www.theitem.com/stories/sumter-school-board-holding-called-meeting-tuesday-night,322683). National and International news comes directly from the [Associated Press.](https://www.theitem.com/stories/sumter-school-board-holding-called-meeting-tuesday-night,322683)
Editorially, there is a significant lean right, with most op-eds favoring the right such as this:
[Racism liberals don’t recognize is really their own](https://www.theitem.com/stories/racism-liberals-dont-recognize-is-really-their-own,308654?). Here is another example of a right-leaning editorial: [Impeachment is just a liberal fantasy](https://www.theitem.com/stories/impeachment-is-just-a-liberal-fantasy,313890). In general, straight news reporting has a minimal bias; however, editorially, this is a strongly right-biased newspaper.
