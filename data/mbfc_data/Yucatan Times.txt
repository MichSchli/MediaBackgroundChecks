Analysis / Bias
The website covers local, cultural, social, and political news for the Yucatan region. Articles and headlines present information with minimal bias, such as this
[In 2024, a new IMSS hospital will open in Mérida’s Francisco de Montejo subdivision](https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2023/12/in-2024-a-new-imss-hospital-will-open-in-meridas-francisco-de-montejo-subdivision/). This article lacks hyperlinked sourcing and simply references the TYT Newsroom without a link. In fact, all articles reviewed lacked proper sourcing. When covering national news, they mention the source used but do not hyperlink.
Editorially, op-eds lean more towards a critique of the current left-leaning government
[AMLO criticizes Peru’s democracy but praises Cuba’s dictatorship (Opinion)](https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2023/05/amlo-criticizes-perus-democracy-but-praises-cubas-dictatorship-opinion/), which could be interpreted as favoring right-leaning perspectives, although the criticism seems more focused on governance issues rather than ideological stances. In general, the website aligns with the right center and is reasonably factual; however, the lack of transparency and lack of sourcing reduces its credibility.
