History
[Founded in 2013, by Tony Blasioli](http://whois.domaintools.com/powderedwigsociety.com), The [Powdered Wig Society](https://powderedwigsociety.com/about-the-painting/) “draws its name from John Trumbull’s painting, Declaration of Independence, which depicts Mr. Jefferson and his five-man drafting committee presenting their work to Congress. The painting can be found on the back of the U.S. $2 bill. The original, which is 12′ x 18′, hangs in the US Capitol rotunda. It’s our hope that our representatives, who walk by this painting regularly, come to fully understand its significance.” The domain is registered in Hawaii.
