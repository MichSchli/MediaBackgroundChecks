Analysis / Bias
In review, FDD’s Long War Journal covers stories about countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Iraq and follows the actions of al Qaeda and its affiliates. Story selection often fits within their stated mission of covering the war on terror. Headlines contain minimally loaded language such as this:
[Taliban supplies al Qaeda with explosives for attacks in major Afghan cities](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/09/taliban-supplies-al-qaeda-with-explosives-for-attacks-in-major-afghan-cities.php). This story is appropriately sourced to [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) and the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense.
In another sample story,
[Several districts change hands as fighting rages in northern Afghanistan](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/09/several-districts-change-hands-as-fighting-rages-in-northern-afghanistan.php); there is again proper sourcing to local media as well as [DW.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/) and the Afghanistan Times.
Editorially, FDD tends to remain neutral when discussing political issues; however, at times, they are critical of former President Trump’s foreign policy, such as this:
[Trump caves to Pakistan on Afghanistan](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/07/trump-caves-to-pakistan-on-afghanistan.php). In general, story selection focuses on the war on terror, with FDD taking hawkish right-leaning positions on combating terrorism.
