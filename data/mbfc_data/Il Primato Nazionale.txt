Analysis / Bias
Il Primato Nazionale frequently employs emotionally loaded language in their articles. For instance, Il Primato Nazionale’s article titled “
[Meloni to businesses: “With you, an Italian miracle.” But relief is needed, not just words”](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/primo-piano/meloni-alle-imprese-con-voi-miracolo-italiano-ma-servono-sgravi-non-solo-parole-266200/) on Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leader of the conservative Brothers of Italy party, uses a mix of praise and criticism. The piece acknowledges Meloni’s recognition of Italian businesses but argues for the necessity of substantive policy support, advocating for structural changes like tax cuts—a stance typically associated with right-wing economic policies.
In Il Primato Nazionale’s coverage of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s response to the trucker protests, titled
[“Canada, accounts frozen for those who protest: this is how Trudeau will suffocate the truck drivers of the Freedom Convoy,”](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/esteri/canada-conti-congelati-protesta-trudeau-camionisti-freedom-convoy-223976/) the use of terms such as “open war” and “extraordinary powers” suggests a critical and somewhat sensationalized view of Trudeau’s actions. The author’s self-described mission to counter the “cultural hegemony of the left” further underscores this right-wing bias.
Il Primato Nazionale uses hyperlinks to other news sources in its articles and circular referencing. Sources occasionally include credible sources such as
[ANSA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/agenzia-nazionale-stampa-associata-ansa/). However, generally, they cite conservative-leaning sources like the [Financial Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-post/), [Il Giornale](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/il-giornale/), and the [New York Post. ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/)These sources often align with Il Primato Nazionale’s editorial stance, reflecting a selection bias that reinforces their conservative viewpoint. Such sourcing practices can influence the overall narrative of their articles, supporting their right-centric approach to news reporting.
Concerning Coverage of LGBT Issues, The publication’s approach to LGBT topics is marked by a sensationalist and often critical tone. In the article
[“A hell called “gender transition,”](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/cronaca/inferno-chiamato-transizione-di-genere-245330/) terms like “hell” and “horrors of the LGBT lobby” are strong and emotionally loaded; such language can contribute to sensationalizing the issue and may lead to biased or one-sided perceptions. Their negative portrayal of companies like [North Face for supporting LGBT ](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/esteri/north-face-marchetta-al-gay-pride-263075/)causes during Pride month, and their depiction of individuals participating in these events suggest a bias against the LGBT community. This approach can contribute to stigmatizing and marginalizing LGBT individuals and issues.
Regarding factuality, we have found evidence that the website frequently promotes conspiracy theories and misinformation, such as
[South Africa, the white genocide: between violence and land expropriations](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/esteri/sudafrica-il-genocidio-dei-bianchi-minacce-tra-violenze-ed-espropriazioni-di-terre-89449/). The conspiracy that South African farmers were being murdered is [false](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2018/05/no-katie-hopkins-there-no-white-genocide-south-africa). Further, they promoted the false claim by [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tuckercarlson-com-bias/) that the Capitol Police escorted the rioters [Other shadows on Capitol Hill: Trump’s shaman walked around escorted by the police (Video)](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/esteri/altre-ombre-su-capitol-hill-lo-sciamano-di-trump-girava-scortato-dalla-polizia-video-257513/). This claim was rated [Pants on Fire](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/mar/08/tucker-carlson/evidence-rebuts-tucker-carlsons-claim-about-capito/) by fact-checker [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/). Finally, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Il Primato Nazionale advanced numerous false and misleading claims, such as stating, “ [The spike protein in the vaccine is a neurotoxin.”](https://www.ilprimatonazionale.it/scienza-e-tecnologia/montagnier-vaccino-campagna-piena-pandemia-errore-grave-206674/) This claim is also [false](https://health-desk.org/articles/what-do-we-know-about-the-toxicity-of-spike-proteins-made-from-covid-19-vaccines).
In general, Il Primato Nazionale is characterized by a right bias and a tendency towards sensationalism in its reporting. The use of emotionally loaded language, particularly in political and LGBT-related articles, and a preference for sourcing from conservative publications shape its narrative. While many stories are factual, there is strong evidence that they promote false and misleading conspiracy theories that are common with the far-right.
