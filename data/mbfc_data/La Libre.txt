Analysis / Bias
In 2021,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Belgium 11/180 in their [Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/belgium). The Prime Minister of Belgium is [Alexander De Croo](https://www.voanews.com/europe/7-parties-agree-belgian-government-led-liberal-de-croo), who leans center-right (The [coalition government](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-parliamentary-elections-archive-elections-3bf390ed4a780673027c937fe2f164da) consists of Liberals, Socialists, and Greens).
La Libre’s political orientation has historically been defined until 1999 as strongly Catholic in orientation. However, since being acquired by the IPM Group has moved toward a more
[liberal-centrist perspective](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148664/la-libre-belgique).
In review, La Libre covers French and Belgian news with minimally loaded language, such as this
[Belgium plans to start vaccinations from January 5, De Croo announces](https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/la-belgique-prevoit-de-commencer-les-vaccinations-a-partir-du-5-janvier-annonce-de-croo-5fc77d75d8ad587479623c48). International news and news pertaining to the USA is often provided through Belga or [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), such as this [Will Trump pardon some of his allies? An investigation is carried out into an alleged corruption to obtain the presidential pardon](https://www.lalibre.be/international/amerique/elections-us/trump-va-t-il-gracier-certains-de-ses-allies-une-enquete-a-ete-lancee-sur-une-presumee-corruption-pour-obtenir-la-grace-presidentielle-5fc72cbad8ad585a45bdb936).
Editorially, La Libre properly labels all opinion content. A review of editorials reveals a reasonable balance with slightly more favoring the right such as this
[It is not by playing with fears and by seeking to create “shock effects” that the population will appropriate the restrictions which are put in place.](https://www.lalibre.be/debats/opinions/ce-n-est-pas-en-jouant-avec-les-peurs-et-en-cherchant-a-creer-des-effets-de-choc-que-la-population-va-s-approprier-les-restrictions-qui-sont-mises-en-place-5fc65f599978e23b12d7de1c) Further, when reporting on Center-Right Prime Minister De Croo, they report objectively and without harsh criticism such as this [Aligning allowances to the poverty line would cost the state at least 700 million euros](https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/politique-belge/aligner-les-allocations-sur-le-seuil-de-pauvrete-couterait-au-moins-700-millions-d-euros-a-l-etat-5fc747077b50a65ab1a0d8b6). La Libre generally reports news factually and with a minimal right-leaning editorial bias.
