Analysis / Bias
In review, Canadaland reports news on their website with moderately loaded language, such as
[The King Of Canadian Conservative Shitposting](http://www.canadalandshow.com/ontario-proud-shitposting-king-jeff-ballingall/). Canadaland works to expose false information and misreporting by the media. Although they cover both sides of politics, they tend to favor the left through story selection. All information is well-sourced, and a [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=canadaland&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have not failed a fact check.
