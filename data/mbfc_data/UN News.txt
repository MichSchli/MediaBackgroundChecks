Funded by / Ownership
The United Nations (UN) owns and operates the UN News portal. Member states fund the UN via
[assessed contributions](https://www.un.org/en/ga/contributions/Briefing%20on%20scale%20methodology%20June%202022.pdf) for the regular budget. Each member country’s contribution to the [UN regular budget](https://www.un.org/en/ga/contributions/assessments.shtml) is based on a complex formula. Please view this [Quartz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quartz/) article regarding methodology and the [formula](https://qz.com/1398226/un-budget-funding-formula-us/).

Analysis / Bias
[The Nobel Peace Prize 2001](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2001/summary/) was awarded to United Nations (UN), and its Secretary-General Kofi Annan “for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world.” In 2020, [The UN World Food Programme (WFP)](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/10/1075012), which provides food assistance worldwide, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for combating hunger.
Global views of the UN are primarily
[favorable](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/09/16/international-views-of-the-un-are-mostly-positive/). According to [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/), although 61% of Americans offer a positive opinion about United Nations (UN), there is a difference between liberals and conservatives. For example, “Eight-in-ten liberals rate the organization favorably, while just four-in-ten conservatives say the same.” The United Nations (UN) is generally unpopular on the right, as evidenced by former President Trump, who [reduced](https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs) or [cut off](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/world/asia/rex-tillerson-north-korea-nikki-haley.html) funding to some UN agencies. However, according to the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-on-foreign-relations/) (CFR), [“President Biden has reversed those cuts.”](https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs)
In review, the UN News website publishes various articles on “Peace and Security, Economic Development, Humanitarian Aid, Climate and Environment, Human Rights, UN Affairs, Women, Migrants, and Refugees.” Articles are typically published with emotionally loaded language such as:
[“Top UN officials saddened at mob violence during US Capitol breach; Bachelet decries ‘incitement’ by political leaders.”](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/01/1081542) A quote from the article reads, “Several thousand protesters marched on the US Capitol in Washington DC, the heart of American democracy and home to the House of Representatives and the Senate, after being addressed by President Trump and his supporters outside the White House, who are continuing to make false claims of election rigging.”
Regarding sourcing, they rely on other UN agencies/entities such as
[World Health Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), UNESCO, IMF (International Monetary Fund), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and World Trade Organization (WTO).
Editorially, UN News favors a progressive liberal perspective with concerns about
[climate change](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127761), [human rights,](https://news.un.org/en/news/topic/human-rights) [education](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1127121), [social justice](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/ifsd/SocialJustice.pdf), and support for [LGBTQ rights](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1128181). In general, UN News is fact-based and has left-leaning editorial and advocacy positions.
