Analysis / Bias
In review, Action News 3 publishes fake news stories with sensational headlines such as this:
[425-POUND TEACHER SUSPENDED FOR SITTING ON STUDENT’S HEAD AND FARTING IN HIS MOUTH](http://actionnews3.com/425-pound-teacher-suspended-sitting-students-head-farting-mouth/). Obviously, this story is not real and is not sourced. It also isn’t labeled as satire. Further, [Snopes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/snopes/) has placed this source on their [fake news list](https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/), reporting that they “advance topical fake news items under the guise of a small local news affiliate.” This site does not hold any particular bias; it simply publishes fake news.
