In review, Port Perry Star uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[It’s Thursday and our top story is assault, weapons charges laid after alleged Hwy. 401 road rage assault in Oshawa](https://www.therecord.com/local-oshawa/news/2023/03/23/live-now-it-s-thursday-and-our-top-story-is-assault-weapons-charges-laid-after-alleged-hwy-401-road-rage-assault-in-oshawa.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
