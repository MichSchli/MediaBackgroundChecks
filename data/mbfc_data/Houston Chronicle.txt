Analysis / Bias
In review, the Houston Chronicle covers local news via journalists and national/international news through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). There is minimal use of loaded language in news coverage, and all information is properly sourced.
Editorially, the Houston Chronicle typically endorses Democratic candidates such as Hillary Clinton for President in 2016 and
[Beto O’Rourke for Senate](https://www.newsweek.com/houston-chronicle-endorses-beto-orourke-1179388) over Republican Ted Cruz. However, the Chronicle does not always support Democratic candidates, as seen by [consistent support for Republicans](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/) up until 2004 and then again in 2012 for Mitt Romney. However, in 2024, they again [endorsed](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/joe-biden-2024-democratic-primary-president-18670527.php) current Democratic President [Joe Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/).
