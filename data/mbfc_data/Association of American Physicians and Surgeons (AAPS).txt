History
Founded in 1944, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is an ultra-conservative political advocacy group that frequently publishes misinformation and pseudoscience. According to their
[about page](https://aapsonline.org/about-aaps/), “The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons – AAPS – is a non-partisan professional association of physicians in all types of practices and specialties across the country.” The current President is Melinda Woofter, and the Executive director is Jane M. Orient.
AAPS has also published a medical journal since 1996, called the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons (JPandS). This journal is not listed in academic literature databases such as
[MEDLINE](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/medscape/)/ [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/) due to the publication of information that [lacks scientific validity](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/business/19physicians.html). Further, the U.S. [National Library of Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_of_Medicine) declined repeated requests from AAPS to index the journal. Finally, JPandS was listed on [Beall’s list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beall%27s_list) of potential or [probable](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/rogue-doctors-spreading-right-wing-rumors-hillarys-health/) predatory [open-access journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-access_journal), with [Chemical and Engineering News](https://cen.acs.org/articles/86/i23/Defending-Science.html) describing the journal as a “purveyor of utter nonsense.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
AAPS is a 501(c)(6) organization funded through donations and membership fees. The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose funding information. According to
[Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), they contribute 100% to [Republican candidates and causes](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2018&cmte=C00041590).
Analysis / Bias
In review, AAPS is a hyperpartisan conservative association that advocates for policy that
[aligns with conservative positions](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Some of the issues they support are as follows: [Opposition to Medicare and Medicaid](https://aapsonline.org/aaps-news-october-2019-medicare-for-nobody/) [Opposition to the Affordable Care Act](https://aapsonline.org/overturning-obamacare-would-benefit-americans-aaps-tells-president-and-congress/) [Opposition to Abortion](https://aapsonline.org/medical-abortions-four-times-as-risky-as-surgical-reports-the-journal-of-american-physicians-and-surgeons/) [Opposition to Gun Control](https://web.archive.org/web/20131021015153/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/az-aapsguncontrol-idUSnPNDC73885%2B1e0%2BPRN20130904) [Human Influenced Climate Change Denial](https://aapsonline.org/climate-change-alarm-supported-by-some-medical-journals-but-not-by-the-evidence/) [Anti-LGBTQ](https://aapsonline.org/gone-too-far-drag-queen-lunacy-and-child-abuse/)
AAPS has also advanced numerous questionable claims related to science and health, such as these:
[Promotion of Autism-Vaccine connection](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/) [HIV does not cause AIDS](https://www.jpands.org/vol12no4/bauer.pdf) [President Barack Obama was covertly hypnotizing people with his speeches, and that this might explain why Jews voted for him.](https://aapsonline.org/oratory-or-hypnotic-induction/)
AAPS has also promoted that
[abortion increases breast cancer risk](https://www.jpands.org/vol10no4/brind.pdf). According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), the consensus of studies indicates that “induced abortion is not linked to an increase in breast cancer risk.” Further, AAPS is listed on [Quackwatch](https://quackwatch.org/consumer-education/nonrecorg/) as a source that is “untrustworthy and non-recommended.”
Editorially, all information promotes a far-right conservative agenda. When reporting on politics, they routinely have a favorable view of the Trump administration
[Physicians Thank Trump, Say More Freedom Needed to Fight COVID-19](https://aapsonline.org/physicians-thank-trump-say-more-freedom-needed-to-fight-covid-19/) while advancing right-wing conspiracy theories directed at Democrats such as: [Is Hillary Clinton Medically Unfit to Serve?](https://aapsonline.org/is-hillary-clinton-medically-unfit-to-serve/). Further, during the Coronavirus outbreak of 2020, they frequently promoted misinformation, such as the promotion of [Hydroxychloroquine](https://aapsonline.org/hcqsuit/), which has been proven [ineffective against Covid-19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2012410). They have also published an article titled [Mask Facts](https://aapsonline.org/mask-facts/) that points to cherry-picked information demonstrating that [masks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) are ineffective in preventing the transmission of Covid-19. While a mask may not be 100% effective in stopping the transmission of Covid-19, or any virus for that matter, [extensive research](http://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf) over many years has demonstrated that masks significantly reduce disease transmission. In general, AAPS is a quackery-level pseudoscience source that promotes conspiracy theories and medical misinformation to support a conservative agenda.
