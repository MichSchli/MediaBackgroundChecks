History
Founded in 2015, Lead Stories is a fact-checker and hoax/rumor debunker that uses the
[International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers code of principles](https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles) to guide all fact-checking. According to their [about page](https://leadstories.com/about.html), “Lead Stories is mainly written by [Maarten Schenk](http://leadstories.com/maarten-schenk.html) and [Alan Duke](http://leadstories.com/alan-duke.html). Maarten is based in Europe (Belgium), while Alan is in the United States of America (California). Administrative and legal affairs are handled by [Perry R. Sanders of Sanders Law Firm](https://www.perrysanderslaw.com/attorneys/perry-r-sanders-jr/) in Colorado Springs.”

[“Since February 2019](https://hoax-alert.leadstories.com/3470158-facebook-partnership.html), we are actively part of [Facebook’s partnership with third-party fact-checkers](https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/182222309230722). Under the terms of this partnership, we get access to listings of content that has been flagged as potentially false by Facebook’s systems or its users, and we can decide independently if we want to fact-check it or not. In addition to this, we can enter our fact checks into a tool provided by Facebook, and Facebook then uses our data to help slow down the spread of false information on its platform. Facebook pays us to perform this service for them, but they have no say or influence over what we fact check or what our conclusions are, nor do they want to.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, Lead Stories LLC was formed by Maarten Schenk (Belgium), Alan Duke (California), Perry R. Sanders (Colorado), and John C. Goede (Florida). The company is self-funded with no outside investors and relies on advertising revenue and license fees for the use of the
[Trendolizer™](http://get.trendolizer.com/) engine and is also funded with revenue derived from Facebook’s third-party fact-checking partnership.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Lead Stories is similar to
[Snopes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/snopes/) in the stories they fact-check; however, they place a stronger emphasis on tracking fake political news and misleading satire. What separates them is using a specific engine called the [Trendolizer](http://get.trendolizer.com/), which tracks story trends that allow Lead Stories to debunk fake news before it becomes viral quickly. Lead Stories does not use loaded language and factually sources all fact checks with credible information. All fact-checks reviewed were accurate.
