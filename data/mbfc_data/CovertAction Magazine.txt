Analysis / Bias
CovertAction Magazine focuses on investigative journalism with a left-leaning bias. The website covers various topics, including politics, history, and social issues. The tone is often critical, especially towards U.S. foreign policy and capitalist systems.
For example, in the article
[“Biden’s ](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2021/12/31/bidens-first-year-foreign-policy-record-may-be-worse-than-trumps/) [First Year Foreign Policy Record May Be Worse Than Trump’s](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2021/12/31/bidens-first-year-foreign-policy-record-may-be-worse-than-trumps/),” the magazine criticizes [President Biden’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) foreign policy, arguing that it has been “more hawkish” than [Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). The article uses biased language such as “escalated dangerous conflicts,” “murderous drone strikes,” and “illegal U.S. war.” It also fails to offer a balanced view of Biden’s foreign policy by not offering counter-arguments.
Additionally, the article mentions the magazine had previously endorsed Biden as a “lesser evil” to Trump, indicating a complex but not necessarily balanced editorial stance. The author cites various sources, some of which are rated questionable, such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Military Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-times/), [Kremlin.ru (Questionable)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kremlin-ru-bias/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and [Global Times (China)(Questionable)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-times-china/).
In the article ”
[Ruling Class Faction Mounts Coup Against Nixon and Trump: Should Progressives Support Such Efforts?](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2023/04/26/ruling-class-faction-mounts-coup-against-nixon-and-trump-should-progressives-support-such-efforts/)” the magazine argues that Richard Nixon and Donald Trump were the victims of “orchestrated efforts” by factions within the ruling class to remove them from power. The article cites a variety of sources, including [USAToday](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today/), Libertysentinel.org, gov.info, [cbsnews.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/), [wikipedia.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), [cnn.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [and BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), including some that are considered to be unreliable, such as [thegrayzoneproject.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-grayzone/). It also presents a contradictory message, as it suggests that progressives should support grassroots activism while also arguing that there is a powerful “deep state” that can thwart such efforts.
Editorially, CovertAction strongly supports anti-war and anti-imperialism measures as well as support for progressive social issues such as
[LGBTQ rights](https://covertactionbulletin.podbean.com/e/fighting-fascism-imperialism-during-pride/), [climate change activism](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2023/06/15/covertaction-bulletin-nyc-on-fire-how-do-we-solve-the-global-climate-crisis/), and [anti-racism](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2020/08/11/systemic-racism-and-oppression-networks-of-white-supremacy-in-the-united-states/). However, they have frequently reported misinformation and false claims related to [Covid-19](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2023/02/27/was-the-pentagon-and-cia-behind-the-covid-19-pandemic/) and the [Ukraine](https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/04/06/was-alleged-russian-army-massacre-of-civilians-at-bucha-actually-a-false-flag-event-staged-by-ukrainian-nazis/) (See failed fact checks.)
