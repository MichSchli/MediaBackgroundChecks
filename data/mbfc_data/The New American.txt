Analysis / Bias
In review, the New American publishes news that is favorable to the right. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Rep. Massie Ridicules John Kerry’s “Pseudo-Science” on Climate](https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/32004-rep-massie-ridicules-john-kerry-s-pseudo-science-on-climate). This story is sourced back to old New American articles and not too credible sources to support their claims. When it comes to science New American [does not support](https://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php?option=com_googlesearch_cse&n=30&view=googlesearchs&Itemid=&cx=017005590850498995214%3Asnxgxrq2gpc&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=climate+change&sa=Search) the [consensus of science](https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/24653-climate-change-report-record-global-cooling-over-last-eight-months) on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). In general, New American publishes stories that are always favorable to the right such as this: [Seattle Is Dying: Radical “Progressivism” Is the Reason.](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/31992-seattle-is-dying-radical-progressivism-is-the-reason) Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they have promoted misinformation.
