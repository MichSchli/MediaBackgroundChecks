In review, the Hamilton Spectator uses low biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Pedestrian taken to hospital after Stoney Creek collision](https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2022/04/07/stoney-creek-pedestrian-struck-queenston-road.html). National news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left, such as this
[Ukraine war plus COVID means more people will need mental health supports](https://www.thespec.com/opinion/contributors/2022/04/07/ukraine-war-plus-covid-means-more-people-will-need-mental-health-supports.html). In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
