Analysis / Bias
According to
[Ehud Rosen](http://www.jcpa.org/text/Mapping_Delegitimization.pdf), MEMO generally supports Islamist positions within Palestinian politics. According to [Andrew Gilligan](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/11398538/How-the-Muslim-Brotherhood-fits-into-a-network-of-extremism.html), the Middle East Monitor promotes a strongly pro-Muslim Brotherhood and pro-Hamas viewpoint. [Anshel Pfeffer](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.666966) described MEMO as a “conspiracy theory-peddling anti-Israel organisation”. Our review shows that the Middle East Monitor has a left wing bias in the use of loaded words and also in story choices that promote Islamic positions. We could not find any instances of the Middle East Monitor failing fact checks, but they do sometimes source to questionable media outlets and hence garner a Mixed factual rating.
