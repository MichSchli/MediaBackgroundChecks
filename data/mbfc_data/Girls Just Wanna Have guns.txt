Analysis / Bias
The stories on GJWHG reflect Ms. Giles views, with no apparent attempt at presenting opposing views. There is little to no sourcing in the stories, and with no bylines I assume all of them are written by Ms. Giles herself. In total, GJWHG resembles a personal blog more than an actual news source. Much of the content also borders on conspiracy, only saved because most of the stories have at least some basis. Still, the obvious bias, lack of credible sourcing, and conspiracy overtones earn GJWHG a questionable rating.
They are now connected to The Patriot Journal which has failed numerous fact checks.
