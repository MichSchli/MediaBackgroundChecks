Analysis / Bias
In review, Conservative Politics Today publishes memes, videos, and news stories that consistently favor the right and often denigrate the left. As indicated on their about page, all information about former President Trump is positive. When publishing news articles, all of them come from the
[MAGA Daily Report](https://magadailyreport.com), which we have rated as [Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/maga-daily-report/) due to a lack of transparency as well as the use of poor sources who frequently fail fact checks. A sample news article from the MAGA Daily Reports uses loaded emotional language such as this: [Mitt Romney Stabs Trump In Back, Introduces Bill To Block POTUS From Taking Funds For Border Wall](https://magadailyreport.com/2019/09/mitt-romney-stabs-trump-in-back-introduces-bill-to-block-potus-from-taking-funds-for-border-wall/?fbclid=IwAR36709NVUZFpU5L_oBVFGmqig52NaJJ5nCP1INs8Wg5gxWIuFMr6bKY2jQ). In general, this Facebook page publishes far-right biased content from poor sources.
