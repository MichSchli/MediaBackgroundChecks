Analysis / Bias
In review, WBZ-TV / CBS Boston utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Massachusetts To Sue Trump Administration Over Rollback Of Endangered Species Act”](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/08/12/endangered-species-act-trump-lawsuit-massachusetts-healey/) However, CBS Boston always sources their information from credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and covers the opposition critically as well. For example, in this interview, they are critical of Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, [“Elizabeth Warren Says Killing Of Iran General Part Of ‘Escalating’ Attacks From Trump.”](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/01/03/elizabeth-warren-wbz-tv-interview-president-donald-trump-iran-general-qassem-soleimani-jon-keller/) A quote from the article reads, “That non-response was typical of Warren’s campaign-long reluctance to engage with Sanders (and he with her).” Although this story highlights an interview with Warren, the author provides critical opinions regarding her presidential campaign strategies.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/cbs-news/) found that 40% of CBS News’ audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 39% Mixed, and 20% always or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers CBS News.
