Analysis / Bias
Trends in Molecular Medicine is a hybrid (some open-access) journal that publishes information on molecular medicine. The journal primarily publishes research such as this:
[Therapeutic potential of PANoptosis: innate sensors, inflammasomes, and RIPKs in PANoptosomes](https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914(23)00236-8).
Cell Press is an open-access/hybrid publisher of scientific journals. There are two types of Open Access Journals, legitimate and predatory, both of which charge the author for publication.
[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Trends in Molecular Medicine is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, Cell Press has been criticized for [retracting some studies.](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cell/)
Although Cell Press has retracted some studies in other publications, Trends in Molecular Medicine publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
