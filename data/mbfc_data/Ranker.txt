Analysis / Bias
Ranker offers “crowdsourced lists” across a variety of topics. They use engaging, sensationalistic strategies that persuade readers to click on their lists hence the term clickbait.
Ranker typically uses eye-catching, virality-in-mind headlines such as
[“18 Bizarre Archaeological Finds That Rewrote History As We Know It.” ](https://www.ranker.com/list/archaeology-that-changed-history/nathan-gibson?ref=browse_list&l=1) They use a variety of sources, some credible such as [eurekalert.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/eurekaalert/), [Smithsonian Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/smithsonian-magazine/), and some not; for example, this list titled [“Regular People Who Have Met Donald Trump Describe What It Was Like.”](https://www.ranker.com/list/stories-about-meeting-donald-trump/donn-saylor) is sourced from Reddit, an unreliable source. Other examples of rankings are [“Every US President’s Favorite Food, Ranked”](https://www.ranker.com/list/presidents-favorite-foods/stephanroget?ref=browse_list) and [“The Best LGBTQ+ Drama Films.”](https://www.ranker.com/tags/LGBTQ?ref=mainnav)
Editorially, Ranker is an opinion site relying on the votes and opinions of their readers. However, there is little intentional political bias as the topics cover both sides and serve only to generate clicks on its lists and polls. In general, most content is fact-based, but there is evidence that many of the sources relied upon are not credible; therefore, we rate them as least biased but mixed for factual reporting.
