Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features original commentary written by named authors that covers a wide range of topics, mainly focusing on politics and philosophy. Headlines range from minimally to moderately emotional, such as
[You Don’t Need to Lie to Stop the War](https://arcdigital.media/you-dont-need-to-lie-to-stop-the-war-88204c0cfc57). This story is sourced correctly. Story selection is varied, with some from left perspectives such as this: [They Sure Do Look Guilty](https://arcdigital.media/they-sure-do-look-guilty-440ffb6b411c) and some from a conservative perspective such as [Why Socialism Is Bad.](https://arcdigital.media/why-socialism-is-bad-62b0ac79650a)
Regarding sourcing information, Arc Digital is thorough and uses known credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), and [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/). We did not find any cases of Arc Digital using [Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) and/or [Conspiracy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/) websites to support claims.
Editorially, Arc Digital publishes commentary ranging from progressive liberal to libertarian to conservative. With this said, they provide balance and feature counter articles written to challenge a previous article. For example, in the article,
[Semantics, Cooperatives, Marx, and More](https://arcdigital.media/semantics-cooperatives-marx-and-more-fc315c4fa33b), the author writes a rebuttal to an earlier article offering a differing viewpoint. This is common on the Arc Digital website, and despite promoting biased commentary, they always provide opposing perspectives, which earns them a least biased rating based on balanced story selection.
