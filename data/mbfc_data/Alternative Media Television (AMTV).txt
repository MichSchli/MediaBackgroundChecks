History
[Founded in 2009](https://amtvmedia.com/about/) by Christopher Greene, Alternative Media Television (AMTV) is a classic right-wing conspiracy-pseudoscience website. It utilizes sensational headlines that usually predict doom, such as WWIII. According to their [about page](https://amtvmedia.com/about/), “Christopher Greene started AMTV in 2009 when he decided to quit his job as a broker at Merrill Lynch. After witnessing the collapse of global stock markets in 2008 and seeing just how badly it had devastated millions of people, he decided it was time to take action and do something positive! He started making videos online and now travels the world as a digital nomad, speaker, and motivator.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Alternative Media Television primarily covers financial news, but it also covers mind control, the new world order, and other false claims about anything liberal. For example, they published obviously fake news in 2019 as Joe Biden is currently President
[BREAKING!! JOE BIDEN TO END PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN!! MAJOR SCANDAL!](https://amtvmedia.com/breaking-joe-biden-to-end-presidential-campaign-major-scandal/)
Most of the stories on this website focus on unproven information and/or conspiracies, such as this:
[1.9 TRILLION REASONS TO PREPARE NOW!!!](https://amtvmedia.com/1-9-trillion-reasons-to-prepare-now/) While this may turn out to be a disaster, the two previous Trump stimulus packages did not, and one was for 2.2 trillion dollars. One can detect a level of bias here.
