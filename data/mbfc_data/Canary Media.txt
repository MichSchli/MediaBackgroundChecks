Funded by / Ownership
[The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)](https://rmi.org/about/history/), a nonprofit, owns and publishes Canary Media. Founded in 1982, RMI is focused on reducing carbon emissions through a combination of natural capitalism (market-driven) and government solutions. [According](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/rocky-mountain-institute/#:~:text=RMI%20receives%20substantial%20grants%20from,from%20wealthy%20left%2Dwing%20foundations.) to the right-leaning [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/), “RMI receives substantial grants from the [ClimateWorks Foundation](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/climateworks-foundation/), a left-of-center “pass-through” funding entity that takes donations from wealthy left-wing foundations.” Other notable donors include the Bloomberg Family Foundation, the Sierra Club, and the Oak Foundation.
Canary Media generates revenue through donations to RMI.
Analysis / Bias
Canary Media is a website that publishes news and commentary on the “Climate Crisis” and carbon reduction. Articles and news headlines do not use loaded emotional wording such as this
[Clean energy is cheaper than coal across the whole US, study finds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/clean-energy-is-cheaper-than-coal-across-the-whole-us-study-finds). This story, like most, relies on government sources such as the US Energy Information Administration.
Editorially, most stories and information covers climate solutions with minimal bias; however, commentary often contains an emotional tone, such as this
[COP27: We’re on a highway to climate hell. Let’s build an offramp](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climate-crisis/cop27-were-on-a-highway-to-climate-hell-lets-build-an-offramp). Although biased, this story is properly sourced from credible outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and the [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/).
In another story,
[Chart: Here’s why everyone is freaking out over gas stoves](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/chart-heres-why-everyone-is-freaking-out-over-gas-stoves-this-week), they report on the controversial issue of whether Gas Stoves cause childhood asthma. Canary Media reported the facts that studies do show they cause an increase in childhood asthma. [This report is factual](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/01/hot-air-over-gas-stoves/). In general, all information on Canary Media is factual and holds a left-leaning bias with concerns for climate change and the promotion of climate justice.
