Analysis / Bias
The Militant publishes original news stories related to workerâ€™s rights, socialism, communism, and anti-capitalism. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional language such as this
[Support union battles at Marathon, Amazon!](https://themilitant.com/2021/03/06/marathon-workers-battle-largest-us-refinery-owner/), and [In first attack of Biden presidency, US airstrikes hit targets in Syria](https://themilitant.com/2021/03/06/in-first-attack-of-biden-presidency-us-airstrikes-hit-targets-in-syria/). While the content appears to be factual, it cannot be verified as they do not provide hyperlinks to their sources.
Editorially, The Militant has very strong socialist views and endorses the Socialists Workers Party. Opinion pieces demonstrate equal disdain for conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats such as this
[Democrats push attacks on free speech, rights workers need.](https://themilitant.com/2021/03/06/democrats-push-attacks-on-free-speech-rights-workers-need/) Generally, the news is reported mostly factually and with a far-left socialist bias.
