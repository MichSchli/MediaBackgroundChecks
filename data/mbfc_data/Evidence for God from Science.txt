History
Founded in 1997 by Richard Deem, Evidence for God from Science describes their
[mission](http://www.godandscience.org/about.html) as: “The mission of Evidence for God from Science is to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and to encourage skeptics to examine the truth claims of Christianity. Having once been a skeptic myself, I understand that most skeptics assume Christianity is false before making a serious attempt to examine the evidence. Therefore, our goal is to present the scientific and biblical evidence that supports a rational belief in the existence and love of God.” Richard Deem holds a “master of science degree in microbiology from California State University, Los Angeles, and has been working in basic science research since 1976.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Evidence for God from Science is a Christian apologetics website that defends belief in
[Old Earth Creationism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Old_Earth_Creationism) (the earth is older than 6000 years, but still created by God) by making a [day-age interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-age_creationism) of the Bible, while rejecting Darwinism and Young Earth Creationism. Interestingly, this source not only rejects the consensus of science on many issues, but also rejects literal interpretation of the Bible. When it comes to political views, Evidence for God from Science holds typical right leaning Christian positions such as [anti-abortion](http://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/abort.html), [homosexuality is a choice](http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/homosexuals_born_gay.html), and a rejection of evolution.
