History
Russia Insider is a news website launched in
[September 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_Insider), based in Moscow, Russia. Russia Insider reports on political and social affairs and aims to provide an alternative view to the mainstream news about Russia and country-related issues. Its [mission](http://russia-insider.com/en/about) is media criticism and reform, underlining the issues of Western media, which are seen by the founders as extremely biased, especially on Russia. The current editors are Charles Bausman, Riley Waggaman, and David Curry. [Read how the Russian Government influences Media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The website claims they are owned by their founders and state they are funded through crowdfunding. However, several news agencies have reported that they have sought or received money from
[Russian oligarchs](http://www.interpretermag.com/is-russia-insider-sponsored-by-a-russian-oligarch-with-ties-to-the-european-far-right/) close to the Kremlin.
Analysis / Bias
The website has a tagline that reads, “Epstein didn’t kill himself.” While that may or may not be true, this statement reflects the content of this website. Stories tend to promote conspiracies and make assumptions of the unknown.
In review, Russia Insider reports news from a pro-Russian government perspective. Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional wording that is negative toward America, such as this:
[Oligarchy in America: How the 0.1% Rob Everyone Else Blind – 31 Shocking Data Points](https://russia-insider.com/en/oligarchy-america-how-01-rob-everyone-else-blind-31-shocking-data-points/ri28167). This story is reasonably sourced. However, not all articles are sourced properly, as we found one sourced to the conspiracy website [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/). There is never an article critical of President Putin when reporting on Russia.
In contrast, many articles glorify him as a leader:
[Putin’s Greatest Hits, 20 Yr Compilation Video from Kremlin, Including Folk Dancing with George Bush II](https://russia-insider.com/en/putins-greatest-hits-20-yr-compilation-video-kremlin-including-folk-dancing-george-bush-ii/ri28155). Reporting on the United States often takes a right-wing perspective supporting President Trump. For example, in this story, they publish misleading information regarding immigration: [Majority of Babies Born in US in 2019 Were From Illegal Immigrants or Tourists, to Obtain Citizenship](https://russia-insider.com/en/majority-babies-born-us-2019-were-illegal-immigrants-or-tourists-obtain-citizenship/ri28148). This story is republished from the right-wing hate group [American Renaissance.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-renaissance-magazine/) In general, news reporting is strongly right-biased and promotes Russian propaganda.
Many outlets have accused Russia Insider of a pro-Kremlin propaganda arm:

Russia Insider has also been accused of antisemitism:
