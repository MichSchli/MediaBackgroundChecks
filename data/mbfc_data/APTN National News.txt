Analysis / Bias
APTN National News publishes news
[stories](http://aptnnews.ca/2017/07/13/trump-denies-disaster-declaration-for-dakota-access-pipeline/) using [The Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), which is similar to the [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Local and regional news reporting is reasonably low biased such as this [Tensions rise in Wetaskiwin after homeless shelter closes](https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/tensions-rise-in-wetaskiwin-after-homeless-shelter-closes/). Articles are also properly sourced.
Editorially, they hold left-leaning positions, especially regarding the environment, such as this
[‘A large step forward’: Arctic First Nation goes solar](https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/a-large-step-forward-arctic-first-nation-goes-solar/). Other left-leaning positions they support are social equality for [LGBTQ](https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/first-nations-family-says-its-being-discriminated-against-by-band-council-because-of-sexual-orientation/) and financial equality for women. Finally, they cover Covid-19 from a pro-science perspective.
