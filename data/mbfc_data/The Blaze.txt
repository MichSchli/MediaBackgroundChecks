History
[Founded in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheBlaze), The Blaze is an American conservative pay television network and website founded by talk radio personality [Glenn Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Beck), based in Irving, Texas. The Blaze has studios and offices based in the Las Colinas urban district in Irving and Los Angeles. On December 3, 2018, The Blaze’s television arm merged with CRTV, the subscription video arm of [Conservative Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-review/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Blaze reports news with a far-right bias that utilizes strong loaded words such as
[New Jersey Democrats propose a gerrymandering plan that would give them a permanent majority](https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-jersey-democrats-gerrymandering). This story is sourced correctly from mainstream media outlets. Story selection almost always favors the right on The Blaze, and there is a [heavy Christian bias](https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-refuses-to-allow-second-graders-bible-during-show-and-tell-i-didnt-get-to-tell-them-about-daniel). Again, The Blaze typically sources information appropriately but is selective in the stories they run and how they are presented to favor the right.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/theblaze/) found that 7% of The Blaze’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 8% Mixed, and 85% always or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more conservative audience strongly prefers them.
During the 2020 Presidential election, The Blaze advanced conspiracy theories related to election fraud. Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they have made inaccurate claims. See Fact Checks below. In 2022, The Blaze continues to promote misinformation regarding Covid-19. Amazingly, the media reviewer
[Newsguard](https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-jersey-democrats-gerrymandering) still grants this source a green shield of credibility. We are unsure how much false information they require, but it must be a lot.
