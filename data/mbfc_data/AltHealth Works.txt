Analysis / Bias
In review, AltHealthWorks publishes news related to alternative health. Articles are broken down into categories such as GMO, Monsanto, Natural Treatments, and
[Alternative Medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/). When reporting on GMOs, they are often negative and deviate from the consensus of science such as this [Farmer Conducts Experiment Using GMO and Non-GMO Corn, Discovers Sobering Truth That Animals Know and Humans Don’t](https://althealthworks.com/18610/farmer-conducts-experiment-using-gmo-and-non-gmo-corn-discovers-sobering-truth-about-animals-and-humans/). In another article titled [10 Documented Reasons GMOs are Anti-American](https://althealthworks.com/2892/the-top-ten-reasons-gmos-are-not-patriotic/) they promote the [debunked](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/gmwatch-anti-biotech-news-hub-goal-is-to-remove-all-gmo-crops-and-food/) 2012 study by [Gilles-Éric Séralini,](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/gilles-eric-seralini-activist-professor-face-anti-gmo-industry/) which was retracted from the Food and Chemical Toxicology Journal the “following year after a detailed review following criticism from scientists and regulatory bodies, which found a pattern of bias and design flaws. The study used cancer-prone rats, shoddy controls, and the data cherry-picked (e.g., data showed some rats fed glyphosate had few tumors, which the authors did not highlight in their commentary).”
AltHealthWorks also promotes
[ miracle cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) such as eating a Non-GMO diet that cures just about everything, including autism: [Mothers Break the Silence: How Feeding Their Kids a Non-GMO Diet Healed Everything From Autism Symptoms to Autoimmune Disease](https://althealthworks.com/14342/non-gmo-diet-reverses-disorders-in-children-author/). Speaking of autism, they also go against the consensus of the science in claiming that [vaccines cause autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/) as well as promoting that [autism can be cured](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-cures/), [which is not true](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism/beware-of-non-evidence-based-treatments/): [“There is No Better Feeling:” Child’s Autistic Symptoms Miraculously Disappear After Doctor Makes One Simple-Yet-Profound Change](https://althealthworks.com/10294/childs-autistic-symptoms-disappear-after-the-doctor-does-thisyelena/).
