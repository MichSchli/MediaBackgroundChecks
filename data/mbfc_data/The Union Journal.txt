History
[Founded in 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/theunionjournal.com), The Union Journal is an imposter news and opinion website. They completely lack transparency as location is not revealed, authors do not have bio’s, the [about page](https://theunionjournal.com/about-us/) claims they are a financial website (they are not), and ownership is not revealed. The two names associated with the website are Miriam Jackson and Carlos Christian.
Funded by / Ownership

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Union Journal is an imposter website, meaning it looks like an official newspaper website covering New York City. We are not rating this website for bias because they simply publish anything they can. Here is how it works. They take a credible news story from a source like the New York Times and then run the text through text re-writer (or it is re-written by someone with poor English language skills.) This is apparently done to prevent plagiarism. Unfortunately, this technology is not very advanced, which results in sentences that do not make sense. For example,
[here is text](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/world/asia/ninez-cacho-olivares-dead.html?emc=rss&partner=rss) from a [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) story they published: “Rather than the puckish humor she used in jabbing at Mr. Marcos, her more recent tone was often sarcastic.” This is what that [sentence looks like](https://theunionjournal.com/ninez-cacho-olivares-journalist-and-critic-of-marcos-dies-at-78/) on The Union Journal “Rather than the puckish wit she made use of in jabbing at Mr Marcos, her even more current tone was usually ironical.” And yes, the bunched together text also comes from copying and pasting directly from the text re-writer or so it seems.
Although The Union Journal is republishing real news stories from credible sources they are essentially unreadable after being re-written by a machine.
