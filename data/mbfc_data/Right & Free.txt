History
[Founded in 2012](http://whois.domaintools.com/rightandfree.com), Right & Free is a hyper-partisan conservative news and opinion website with a tagline that reads: “Right & Free is dedicated to defeating the liberal agenda with the power of the Internet.” According to their [about page](https://rightandfree.com/about), “We believe steadfastly in our Founding Fathers’ vision of a land where the government serves the people, not the other way around. We believe that “We the People” are in control..”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Right & Free publishes news and mostly opinion pieces from a conservative perspective. The website features prominent conservative and libertarian columnists such as
[Brent Bozell III](https://rightandfree.com/columnists/l-brent-bozell-iii), [Michelle Malkin](https://rightandfree.com/columnists/michelle-malkin), [Judge Napolitano](https://rightandfree.com/columnists/judge-andrew-p-napolitano), and [Dennis Prager](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/). Headlines and wording can range from minimally loaded such as this, [Trump and Black Outreach](https://rightandfree.com/news/2019/11/19/trump-and-black-outreach), to highly emotional such this, [Does the Left Hate America?](https://rightandfree.com/news/2019/11/18/does-the-left-hate-america) This latter column is written by Dennis Prager who is the founder of the Questionable [PragerU](https://rightandfree.com/news/2019/11/18/does-the-left-hate-america). Some of the other authors, such as Brent Bozell III, who founded [MRC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-research-center-mrc/) and [CNS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/) have a poor track record with fact-checkers.
Editorially, Right & Free

- Lower taxes and spending (especially on entitlement programs)
- Strong national defense
- Repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)
- Pro-Life
- Freedom of Religion
- Free Markets
- Energy Independence (Human Influenced Climate Change Skepticism)
Regarding science, they present skepticism when it comes to
[human-influenced climate change, such](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) as this: [Climate Myths](https://rightandfree.com/news/2019/11/19/climate-myths). This story does not deny that the earth is warming; however, it does attempt to minimize the impacts while pointing out the “alarmism” of others.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years; however, many of their columnists have poor fact-check records, such as
[Michelle Malkin](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=michelle%20malkin).
