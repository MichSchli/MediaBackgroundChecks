History
Founded in 2016 by journalist and author Jason Salzman, The Colorado Times Reporter is a news and opinion website covering Colorado politics from a progressive perspective. According to their
[about page](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/about/), “We aim to be fair and accurate. Our work is nonpartisan, with a progressive orientation, which means we emphasize coverage of Colorado stories that advance or illuminate the progressive values of freedom, justice, responsibility, opportunity, and equality. Conversely, call out/correct/challenge bigotry, racism, misinformation, and conspiracies, particularly — at this moment — election conspiracies.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
