Analysis / Bias
Ada Derana publishes Sri Lankan news using moderately loaded language such as this
[Namal says blocking social media is ‘completely useless](http://www.adaderana.lk/news/81590/namal-says-blocking-social-media-is-completely-useless).’ News articles reviewed do not use hyperlinked sourcing, relying on quotes instead. When reporting world news, they republish from other sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/).
Editorially, Ada Derana is known for its
[pro-government](https://digitalarizonanews.com/crisis-hit-sri-lanka-blocks-social-media-to-contain-protests/) stances. For example, when reporting on government matters, they do not criticize the ruling party [“Decisive meeting between President and PM?”](http://www.adaderana.lk/news/81600/decisive-meeting-between-president-and-pm) In this story, they report on an important meeting between the President and Prime Minister even though they are bothers in the same party. When writing on the opposition party, they promote the government narrative such as this [Opposition’s plan to use new normalization for protests is unfortunate – President](http://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=78325). In general, the news is fact-based, but poorly sourced and one-sided favoring the Government.
