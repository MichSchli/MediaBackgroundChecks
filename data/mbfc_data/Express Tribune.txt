Analysis / Bias
Despite being affiliated with The International
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), The Express Tribune [censors](http://www.journalismpakistan.com/express-tribune-censors-new-york-times-article) articles from the [international edition](http://pakistan.mom-gmr.org/en/media/detail/outlet/tribunecompk/) of NYT it distributes within Pakistan. On the other hand, the website offers a blend of entertainment and current affairs in Pakistan while adhering to a market-driven, pro-establishment, and middle-of-the-road editorial policy.
The Express Tribune publishes articles with a neutral tone towards former
[right-wing](https://www.dw.com/en/who-really-is-imran-khan/a-16798373) prime minister Imran Khan such as [“Imran shuffles Punjab tickets after workers protest PTI chief withdraws 21 tickets, issues 32 with nine new members.”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2413942/imran-shuffles-punjab-tickets-after-workers-protest) In the context of the article, party tickets refer to the official endorsement given by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party to its candidates for the upcoming elections in Pakistan, Punjab.
Another article related to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, titled
[“Audio leaks exposed Imran’s ‘conspiracy’: PM,”](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2380457/audio-leaks-exposed-imrans-conspiracy-pm) does not appear to exhibit any clear signs of bias in either a positive or negative towards PM Sharif. Instead, it reports on the statements made by the Prime Minister during his press conference and does not provide any significant analysis or opinion on the matter. The article does not contain any external sources or citations to support the claims made by the Prime Minister or the information provided in the article.
In general, the Express Tribune is mostly fact-based and holds minimal political bias; however, they face censorship by the Pakistani government that results in the promotion of government propaganda through omission.
