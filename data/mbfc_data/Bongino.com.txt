Analysis / Bias
In review, Bongino.com publishes podcasts from Mr. Bongino’s shows and news articles supposedly written by staff. The focus of this review will be on their written news articles. News stories written by staff typically use moderately loaded emotional language that favors the right, like this:
[Clinton Email Scandal Not Over, New FBI Failure Uncovered](https://bongino.com/clinton-email-scandal-not-over-new-fbi-failure-uncovered/). This story is appropriately sourced to [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and a memo by Senator Grassley. While story selection on this website always favors the right, they also have published misleading conspiracy stories such as claiming “ [this was an illegal coup attempt on the President of the United States.](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/apr/29/donald-trump/was-donald-trump-target-coup-no/)“
Further, podcasts often refer to the
[Spygate conspiracy](https://omny.fm/shows/the-dan-bongino-show/the-epstein-case-explodes-1017), in which they opine that Obama and the FBI illegally spied on the Trump Campaign. This has never been collaborated to be illegal.
Lastly, Bongino frequently reports negatively on the Clintons. For example, they construct an unsubstantiated claim Bill Clinton
[flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane](https://bongino.com/breaking-bill-clinton-issues-statement-on-his-ties-to-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein/) many times, which they assume was for illicit purposes. Another claim states that [illegal immigrants cost taxpayers 100 billion dollars per year.](https://bongino.com/illegal-aliens-cost-taxpayers-100-billion-annually/) This has been fact-checked by the right-leaning [Check Your Fact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/check-your-fact/), which rated it [Unsubstantiated](https://checkyourfact.com/2018/11/11/fact-check-illegal-immigration-cost-100-billion/).
Bongino.com publishes poorly sourced, Right-biased content that often relies on unproven opinions.
