According to their [about page](https://worlddoctorsalliance.com/about/), “World Doctors Alliance (WDA) is a collaboration between medical professionals across the world to address some the most urgent and important issues surrounding the pandemic.” The founder of WDA is Dr. Mohammad Adil.

Analysis / Bias
In review, World Doctors Alliance (WDA) is a news information source supposedly founded and run by Doctors. The homepage features an
[open letter](https://worlddoctorsalliance.com/) to all the citizens and governments of the world. In this letter, they proclaim that herd immunity can be achieved without vaccinations and, most notably, lockdowns are unnecessary and infringe on people’s rights. The letter also promotes that Covid is milder than the flu and conspiracy theories related to death certificates. The views held by the Doctors are that of a far-right perspective.
The website also features a news section that publishes information on other media outlets and journals, often with a critical tone such as this
[BMJ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AMONG UK GOVERNMENTS COVID 19 ADVISERS](https://worlddoctorsalliance.com/blog/bmj-conflicts-of-interest-among-uk-governments-covid-19-advisers/). They also promote pseudoscience such as this [VITAMIN C FOR COVID](https://worlddoctorsalliance.com/blog/vitamin-c-for-covid/). Despite being doctors, they appear to be unaware that [Vitamin C is not effective](https://www.yalescientific.org/2015/03/mythbusters-does-vitamin-c-really-help/) at boosting the immune system. In general, World Doctor Alliance publishes quackery level pseudoscience related to Covid-19 (see failed fact checks below) from a far-right perspective.
