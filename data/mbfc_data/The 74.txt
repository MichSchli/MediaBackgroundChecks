She resigned when she told former President Donald Trump in a [letter](https://static.politico.com/8b/7a/29084d4f45b89aa9e49f4ba01690/devos-letter.pdf) that “there is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had” on the violent riots at the U.S. Capitol.

Analysis / Bias
The 74 publishes news, analysis, and opinion regarding education issues in the USA. Articles and headlines use minimally loaded emotional wording, such as this
[4 Big Takeaways on the Pandemic’s Mixed Effects on NYC Students’ Test Scores](https://www.the74million.org/article/4-big-takeaways-on-the-pandemics-mixed-effects-on-nyc-students-test-scores/). This story is sourced correctly using credible outlets such as [Chalkbeat](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/chalkbeat-bias/), Edsource, and [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/). A review of sourcing across numerous articles reveals consistent use of credible media sources.
Editorially, The 74 adheres to a
[code of ethics](https://www.the74million.org/article/the-74s-code-of-ethics/) in which donors do not dictate editorial coverage. The website appropriately labels opinion content and does not promote overtly biased commentary such as this [10 Tips to Help Community Organizations Bring Needed Services into Schools](https://www.the74million.org/article/10-tips-to-help-community-organizations-bring-needed-services-into-schools%ef%bf%bc/). However, a full review of op-eds reveals more favor a liberal perspective such as this [Time to Make Free School Lunch Programs Permanent — and Open to All](https://www.the74million.org/article/time-to-make-free-school-lunch-programs-permanent-and-open-to-all%ef%bf%bc/) and [Educator’s View: My Former TX District Has Collapsed into Cruelty and Absurdity](https://www.the74million.org/article/educators-view-my-former-tx-district-has-collapsed-into-cruelty-and-absurdity/). This last story is very negative toward conservatives with a quote that reads:
Recently, a school board majority of four radical conservatives, elected with the help of a big bucket of dark money from west Texas billionaires and a “Christian” cell phone service-provider, voted into existence a raft of policies that will harm students, teachers and families.
While the left and unions initially criticized the organization for its advocacy for school choice, they have since focused on all educational issues, including
[racism](https://www.the74million.org/article/texas-educators-worry-that-new-state-legislation-limiting-the-teaching-of-historic-racism-and-current-events-would-whitewash-history/) and [inequality](https://www.the74million.org/article/jeb-bush-ann-d-duplessis-only-a-revolution-in-educational-opportunity-will-fulfill-martin-luther-king-jr-s-dream-of-justice-and-equality-2/). Generally, all content is fact-based and holds a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
