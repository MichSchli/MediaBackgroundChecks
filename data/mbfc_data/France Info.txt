[Emmanuel Macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron) is the President of France; he is also the leader and founder of the centrist and liberal La République En Marche party (REM).
In review, Radio Info publishes articles with minimally loaded emotional language such as “
[Macron “Strike of December 5: Emmanuel Macron remains determined”](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/retraite/reforme-des-retraites/greve-du-5-decembre-emmanuel-macron-reste-determine_3732271.html). When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the former Trump Administration with a critical tone such as in this: “ [The election of Donald Trump worries businesses in the region that export to the United States.](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/election-donald-trump-inquiete-entreprises-region-qui-exportent-etats-unis-1126711.html)” France Info typically utilizes credible sources such as the [Miami Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/miami-herald/), [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), [France 24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/), and UN.org.

Although not a [signatory of the IFCN](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories), their fact checks are credible.
