Analysis / Bias
In review, the San Diego Reader covers local news with moderately loaded words such as this:
[Duncan Hunterâ€™s smoke-filled spending](https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2018/oct/31/ticker-duncan-hunters-smoke-filled-spending/). Story selection [moderately favors the left](https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2018/oct/31/radar-union-tribune-cartoonist-steve-kelley-g/) with stories highlighting Republican corruption. However, all information is properly sourced to credible media outlets or quotations. In general, wording and story selection leans left.
