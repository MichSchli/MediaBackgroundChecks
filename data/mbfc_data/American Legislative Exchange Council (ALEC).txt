History
The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) was founded in 1973 by
[Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/) co-founder and first president, religious conservative activists [Paul Weyrich](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-weyrich19-2008dec19-story.html), [Lou Barnett,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/how-alec-became-a-political-liability/2012/04/24/gIQA3QnyeT_blog.html) and then Republican Illinois Congressman Henry Hyde. Their staff consists primarily of [Republican ](https://www.alec.org/about/leadership/)politicians, state lawmakers, and corporate representatives. On their [about page](https://www.alec.org/about/), they describe themselves as “America’s largest nonpartisan, voluntary membership organization of state legislators dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets, and federalism.” Further, according to their membership page, ALEC has [2000 members](https://www.alec.org/membership/). [Stuart Adams](https://senate.utah.gov/leadership/) is the Senator for the Utah State Senate’s 22nd District; he is also currently serving as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) chairman.

[ 501(c)(3)](https://ballotpedia.org/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council) nonprofit organization that conducts lobbying for [corporations.](https://www.commoncause.org/our-work/money-influence/alec/) According to [Brookings](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/), “ [One feature that separates ALEC from other lobbying ventures is that it partners with corporations whose interests span the space of conservative issues](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/alecs-influence-over-lawmaking-in-state-legislatures/).” Donations are the primary source of revenue. More on revenue can be found [here](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/520140979).

Analysis
According to a betterutah.org
[article](https://betterutah.org/utahs-conflict-of-interest-problem/) titled “Utah’s conflict of interest problem,” ALEC Chairman of the board Stuart Adams “never mentioned his involvement with ALEC on his mandatory conflict of interest disclosure for 2021.”
ALEC offers

They are also known for writing [“model bills”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/03/alec-american-legislative-exchange-council-model-bills-republican-conservative-devos-gingrich/3162357002/) that are criticized for how these ready template bills are [“advancing the agenda of the people who write them.”](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/state-politics/copy-paste-legislate/you-elected-them-to-write-new-laws-theyre-letting-corporations-do-it-instead/) These model bills typically reflect a conservative agenda. For example, a publication called [“The State Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare.”](https://www.alec.org/publication/the-state-legislators-guide-to-repealing-obamacare/)
ALEC has also been criticized for
[promoting](https://www.democracynow.org/2012/9/27/the_united_states_of_alec_bill) “stand your ground” gun laws, as they also drafted the [model](https://newrepublic.com/article/105308/meet-mark-pocan-original-alec-spy) for many ”Stand Your Ground” laws, such as the Florida law involved in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin. Finally, ALEC promotes and [is involved](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/alec-corporations-democracy/) in [voter suppression](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/alec-meeting-gerrymandering-audio-recording.html) legislation.
Bias
In review, ALEC publishes articles such as
[“The Paris Climate Agreement is a Bad Deal for America,”](https://www.alec.org/article/the-paris-climate-agreement-is-a-bad-deal-for-america/) utilizing the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) as sources. According to ucsusa.org, [Exxon Mobil funded](https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/exxonmobil-departure-climate-denying-alec-long-overdue) the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) over 20 years, and as of 2018, they broke with ALEC due to public pressure over the group’s [climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). ALEC also republishes [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/) articles such as [“How States Can Shape Obamacare’s Replacement.”](https://www.alec.org/article/how-states-can-shape-obamacares-replacement/) When reporting on politicians, they generally have a favorable opinion of Republicans, including former President Trump. However, they frequently report negatively on Democrats, such as this [President Biden’s Infrastructure Plan Brings Suspect Benefits at High Costs](https://www.alec.org/article/president-bidens-infrastructure-plan-brings-suspect-benefits-at-high-costs/).
In general, the primary agenda of ALEC is writing/supporting bills that undermine environmental regulations and deny
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). They also promote the interests of businesses/corporations and promote the politicians who support them.
