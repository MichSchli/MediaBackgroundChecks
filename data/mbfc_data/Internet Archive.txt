History
The Internet Archive (IA) is an
[American non-profit digital library](https://archive.org//about/) founded on May 10, 1996, by [Brewster Kahle](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/13/business/media/internet-archive-emergency-lending-library.html). It offers free access to digitized materials, including websites, software applications, music, audiovisual, and print materials. The IA’s mission is to provide “universal access to all knowledge.” The IA allows the public to upload and download digital materials, but most of its data is collected automatically by web crawlers. Its web archive, the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), contains hundreds of billions of web captures. The IA also oversees numerous book digitization projects, among other endeavors.

Funded by / Ownership
The IA operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in the United States. Its funding comes from various sources, including revenue from web crawling services, partnerships, grants, donations, and the
[Kahle-Austin Foundation](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/943242767/04_2021_prefixes_94-95/943242767_201912_990_2021040217865349). In 2019, the IA had an annual budget of $36 million. The IA also engages in periodic fundraising campaigns.
Analysis / Bias
The Internet Archive primarily functions as a digital library and web archiving service. Its content, by nature, is diverse and extensive, covering a vast array of topics and sources. The IA itself does not produce original content that would indicate a political or ideological bias. Instead, it archives content from across the web, which can encompass a broad spectrum of viewpoints.
[The IA’s blog](https://blog.archive.org/) provides updates and stories about its projects, technology, and collaborations, reflecting its mission and activities rather than any political or ideological stance. Similarly, the [“News Stories”](https://archive.org/about/news-stories) section on its website primarily features articles and reports about the Internet Archive itself from various external media sources. However, we did find a bias in the sources they rely on as more favor the left, such as [Rolling Stone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rolling-stone/), [Louisiana Illuminator](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lousiana-illuminator-bias/), [Daily Dot](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-dot/), and [Wired](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/). We also found they sometimes rely on factually mixed sources like the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and [The Conservative Woman](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conservative-woman/).
In general, the Internet Archive does not produce opinion pieces, but it publishes opinionated news stories about itself. While they rely on a wide range of sources, we calculate that more favor the left, and most are factual.
