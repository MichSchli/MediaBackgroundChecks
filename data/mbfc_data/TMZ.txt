History
TMZ is a celebrity news website that debuted on November 8, 2005. It was initially a collaboration between
[AOL](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/aol/) and Telepictures Productions, a division of Warner Bros., until Time Warner divested AOL in 2009. The name TMZ stands for thirty-mile zone, referencing the historic “studio zone” within a 30-mile radius centered in Los Angeles, California. Known for reporting on Hollywood scandals, TMZ has been a significant player in the entertainment news industry. As of September 2021, TMZ was acquired by Fox Corporation from WarnerMedia.

Analysis / Bias
In this updated review, TMZ’s editorial bias appears to have shifted. Historically focused on celebrity news and Hollywood scandals, TMZ has expanded its coverage to include more political issues. A review of recent content reveals a notable emphasis on topics that are typically associated with right-leaning perspectives. For example, TMZ has covered the
[“border crisis”](https://www.tmz.com/2024/01/22/rick-harrison-says-son-died-of-fetanyl-overdose-blames-boarder/) with a frequency and framing that suggests a focus on issues highlighted by conservative media. Similarly, their coverage of [President Biden](https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/21/dukes-of-hazzard-star-john-schneider-death-threat-joe-biden/) and his administration tends to cast them in a negative light, diverging from their previously less politicized content. While these statements are not directly from TMZ, they demonstrate a willingness to air far-right viewpoints from celebrities they may not have covered in the past.
These editorial changes align with the website’s ownership transition to Fox Corporation, a move that might influence its political orientation. While TMZ still retains its sensationalized and tabloid-style reporting:

When it comes to sourcing, TMZ frequently relies on unnamed sources. In general, this is a tabloid rag that is 1 degree better in quality than the

Failed Fact Checks
- TMZ does not usually fail fact checks and often debunks false claims. However, the sensationalism of the content and the opinions of celebrities may be misleading or be false.
