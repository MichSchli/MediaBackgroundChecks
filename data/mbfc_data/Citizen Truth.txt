[THE HYPOCRISY OF TRUMP ACCUSING CHINA OF ELECTION MEDDLING.](https://citizentruth.org/hypocrisy-trump-china-election-meddling/) However, all information in the articles is very well sourced to credible media outlets such as the [BBC](https://citizentruth.org/hypocrisy-trump-china-election-meddling/).
