History
Launched in 2014, the Counter Extremism Project (CEP) is an international policy organization that provides resources and analysis on extremism. The Counter Extremism Project, similar to the
[United Against Nuclear Iran](https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/about/leadership) group, is defined as a [hawkish investigative and advocacy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/group-aims-to-reveal-militant-funding/2014/09/20/6792330c-40f5-11e4-a430-b82a3e67b762_story.html) group that has strong ties to many pro-Israel groups run by [Mark D.

They share advisors like former Homeland Security advisor [Frances Fragos Townsend](https://www.counterextremism.com/people/frances-f-townsend), who serves as the president, and ex-Obama diplomat [Dennis Ross](https://www.counterextremism.com/leadership) and [Joe Lieberman](https://www.counterextremism.com/people/joseph-i-lieberman), who serves as an advisor.

Analysis / Bias
The Counter Extremism Project (CEP) uses emotionally loaded language in the section dedicated to the
[ Israeli-Palestinian conflict](https://www.counterextremism.com/topics/israeli-palestinian-conflict), such as [“Uptick In Hamas Violence Coincides With Continued Hospitality By International Enablers](https://www.counterextremism.com/press/uptick-hamas-violence-coincides-continued-hospitality-international-enablers).” The labeling of Hamas as a terrorist organization varies globally. Countries like [Canada](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canada-media-profile/), [Israel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/), the EU, and the US designate Hamas as a [terrorist organization](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/), while others like [Turkiye](https://worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/the-many-reasons-erdogan-plays-the-palestinian-card), [China](https://asiatimes.com/2021/05/how-china-views-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/), and some African nations do not. Further, it labels those who do not condemn Hamas as “enablers,” presenting a negative connotation. The article, although factual about Hamas’s activities, shows bias by presenting a one-sided view.
The organization also focuses on far right-wing extremism around the world and
[White supremacy groups](https://www.counterextremism.com/content/white-supremacy-groups-united-states) in the United States. The report indicates that fears of the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory are fueling hate and violence in the United States. Indicating they do not hold right-wing viewpoints.
Regarding sourcing Counter Extremism Project (CEP) relies on credible sources such as the
[Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), [Vice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vice-news/), [The Jerusalem Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-jerusalem-post/), [YnetNews](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkc9ozb82), [Al-Monitor, ](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2014/12/saleh-al-arouri-khaled-meshaal-hamas-leadership-turkey-gaza.html)and [Times of Israel.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-israel/) The Counter Extremism Project is generally fact-based and holds right-of-center hawkish advocacy views.
