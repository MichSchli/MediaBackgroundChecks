Analysis / Bias
In review, Carbon Brief publishes articles related to climate change, including fact-checking articles in which headlines are generally low-biased
[“Factcheck: Did climate change contribute to India’s catastrophic ‘glacial flood’?”](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-did-climate-change-contribute-to-indias-catastrophic-glacial-flood) Information is usually properly sourced to credible media outlets such as [BBC,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) [Reuters,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) [AP,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [IPCC,](https://www.ipcc.ch/) and always factual.
Carbon Brief leans left politically in their concern for climate change, as evidenced by this article
[“US election: Climate experts react to Joe Biden’s victory.”](https://www.carbonbrief.org/us-election-climate-experts-react-to-joe-bidens-victory) A quote from the article concerning the general reaction of scientists is positive as the former president had a climate skeptic view and acted accordingly, the quote reads “I find myself filled with relief and hope after what has been a nightmarish four years of the Trump administration reversing or halting numerous federal climate policies, sidelining and silencing scientists and trying to tamper with scientific reports.” In general, they are pro-science in their publications and approach and hold a left-leaning political bias.
