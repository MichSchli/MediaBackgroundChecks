Analysis / Bias
EDF publishes articles with minimal emotional wording, such as
[“Solving Climate Change Takes a Global Effort.”](https://www.edf.org/climate/global-climate-solutions) The body of the article provides well-researched overviews of climate solutions. For example, the article explains why [China](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/) is critical of global climate action and advocates for transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The article cites credible sources like The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and provides clickable subtitles that link to further information.
Another article we reviewed was titled
[“We can feed the world sustainably.”](https://www.edf.org/we-can-feed-world-sustainably) The article argues sustainable agriculture can feed the global population without harming the environment. It cites examples of sustainable practices and the importance of equipping farmers with data and tools to reduce pollution. The article provides a well-researched and informative overview of sustainable agriculture practices, citing sources and statistics to support its claims. Both articles lean left in their advocacy for aggressive action on climate change and sustainable agriculture practices but are generally well-supported by scientific evidence and factual information.
