Analysis / Bias
In review, Corona Transition is a Covid-19 misinformation website that promotes vaccines’ dangers or ineffectiveness, lockdowns, and masks. Essentially, they are opposed to all of the measures that have been proven scientifically to be beneficial in slowing the spread of coronavirus. For example, in these articles, they imply that the Covid-19 vaccine is dangerous
[The European Medicines Agency (EMA) rejected Pfizer vaccine batches but granted approval anyway](https://corona-transition.org/die-europaische-arzneimittelagentur-ema-beanstandete-impfstoff-chargen-von), and [The Australian Minister of Health had to go to hospital after being vaccinated with Astra-Zeneca vaccine](https://corona-transition.org/der-australische-gesundheitsminister-musste-nach-impfung-mit-astra-zeneca), and here [The scandal now has a certain number: mRNA vaccinations are 40 times more dangerous than flu vaccinations](https://corona-transition.org/der-skandal-hat-jetzt-eine-sichere-zahl-mrna-impfungen-sind-40-mal-gefahrlicher). In this article, [A healthy society cares for the sick. A sick society punishes the healthy](https://corona-transition.org/eine-gesunde-gesellschaft-kummert-sich-um-die-kranken-eine-kranke-gesellschaft) they equate [mask-wearing](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) to bondage. In general, the position of Corona Transition is that nothing should be done about Covid-19.
Although there is factual content on this website, there is also false information such as this
[Face masks: ideal breeding grounds for bacteria and fungi](https://corona-transition.org/gesichtsmasken-ideale-nahrboden-fur-bakterien-und-pilze). While it is evident that a mask would contain bacteria as it covers the mouth and nose, there is [no evidence](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-masks-fungal-lung-infection-idUSKBN24B25H) that this causes an increase in illnesses. This article goes on to claim, “Conclusion: wearing a mask is unsuitable and hazardous to health.” While not true, it also is dangerous as wearing a mask is a critical aspect of reducing transmission of Covid-19. In general, Corona Transition holds right-leaning viewpoints and often promotes misinformation.
