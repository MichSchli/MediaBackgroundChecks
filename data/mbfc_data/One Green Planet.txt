Analysis / Bias
In review, One Green Planet supports strongly left-leaning environmental causes and uses loaded language to sway readers. For example this:
[Heck Yeah! Court Rules Trump Administration Can’t Silence Kids Suing the Government for Inaction on Climate Change.](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/court-rules-trump-cant-silence-kids-suing-government-inaction-climate-change/) While MBFC is 100% pro-science and recognizes that [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is real and amplified by humans, this website takes it further through the use of emotional language, rather than facts. With that said most information on this website is linked to proper sources, however, some are not, for example, [this article](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/connection-between-meat-and-menacing-gmos/) uses very strong loaded language to describe [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), which have been deemed safe by the consensus of science.
