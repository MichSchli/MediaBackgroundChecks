Analysis / Bias
Although Jewish Breaking News utilizes credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), they also publish poorly sourced opinion pieces with loaded headlines such as [“Justice Miriam Naor, You Are a Disgusting Individual.”](http://jewishbreakingnews.com/2017/10/26/op-ed-justice-miriam-naor-disgusting-individual/) In general, Jewish Breaking News reports news stories with relatively low bias and proper sourcing, however, editorially there is a right-leaning bias in story selection and wording.
This update shows that they have not published new content since 2022.
