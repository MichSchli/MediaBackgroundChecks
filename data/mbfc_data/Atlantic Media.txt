The Atlantic Media website does not produce original news but rather republishes news from their brands, The Atlantic and National Journal. In the past, they published several other brands, but as of this review, they only retain The Atlantic and National Journal, which we rate High in factual reporting. In general, they publish high-quality sources of factual information with a slight left-leaning bias.
