Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Mining Gazette produces original news covering Northern Michigan. Headlines and articles contain minimal emotional language, such as this:
[Three candidates vie for Hancock’s third-ward votes](https://www.mininggazette.com/news/2020/10/three-candidates-vie-for-hancocks-third-ward-votes/). National and international news is republished from the [Associated Press.](https://www.post-journal.com/news/local-news/2019/10/police-investigating-saturday-stabbing/)
Editorially, the paper does not endorse Presidential candidates. A review of editorial commentary shows a reasonable balance between right and left without delving into extremes; however, slightly more op-eds favor the right such as this:
[C’mon ride the train: Trump parade draws more than 600 cars.](https://www.mininggazette.com/news/2020/09/cmon-ride-the-train-trump-parade-draws-more-than-600-cars/) The news is generally reported factually with a slight conservative bias editorially.
