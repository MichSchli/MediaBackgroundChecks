[Equity: When the Left Goes Too Far](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/political-correctness/equity-when-the-left-goes-too-far/).
Politically, Jordan Peterson has been described as
[Alt. Right](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life), Libertarian, and he [describes himself](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/06/16/why-the-classical-liberal-is-making-a-comeback-218667/) as a British Classical Liberal. He is also a popular figure within the [Intellectual Dark Web](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html), a movement opposed to identity politics and claims that free speech is under siege. Ultimately, the label that best fits Mr. Peterson is [Conservative](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/jordan-peterson-is-conservative-not-classical-liberal).
Below is a list of Peterson’s primary political viewpoints.
[Opposed to political correctness](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/jordan-peterson-university-of-toronto-free-speech-crowdfunding/article35174379/) [Opposed to cultural Marxism](https://areomagazine.com/2017/09/17/the-curious-case-of-jordan-peterson/) [Women’s studies should be defunded](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4396970/u-of-t-profs-alarmed-by-jordan-peterson-s-plan-to-target-classes-he-calls-indoctrination-cults-1.4396974) [There is a crisis of masculinity](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html) [Believes that “order” is masculine and “chaos” is feminine](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html) [Opposed to bill C-16 related to gender pronouns](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/01/15/he-says-freedom-they-say-hate-the-pronoun-fight-is-back.html) [Doubts the scientific consensus on climate change](https://www.ft.com/content/7d2e6802-6040-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68)
While Jordan Peterson rejects being conservative or right-leaning, his audience mainly consists of
[white conservative males](https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2021/06/04/jordan-peterson-beyond-order-neverland-growing-12-rules-240786). Further, his political views are supported by modern conservatives and opposed by progressive Democrats.
In addition to conservative viewpoints, Mr. Peterson has made questionable statements that have been controversial, such as calling a plus-size model “
[not Beautiful](https://www.theedge.co.nz/home/scandal/2022/05/jordan-peterson-called-this-sports-illustrated-model--not-beauti.html)” and consistently making [negative statements](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2022/07/09/how-jordan-peterson-canceled-himself/?sh=727ca3f55bf9) toward transgender persons. Finally, he often promotes misinformation and pseudoscience, especially regarding Gender Identity, Covid-19, and climate change. See failed fact checks below.
Despite Peterson’s claims, he is right biased and sometimes promotes false information.
