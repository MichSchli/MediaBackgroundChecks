History
[Founded in 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice), The Village Voice was the first Alternative weekly paper in the USA. The recipient of three Pulitzer Prizes, the National Press Foundation Award, and the George Polk Award, The Village Voice was a source for coverage of New Yorkâ€™s politics and vast cultural landscape. In 2017, it ceased printed publication and began publishing exclusively online; however, its archives are still accessible online. In late 2018, they officially shut down but occasionally provided a story. For the most part, this is an archive site now. However, they now publish quarterly and update the website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Village Voice produced high-quality journalism that focused on politics, culture, lifestyle, and entertainment in New York City. Throughout its history, they have been known as a left-leaning publication, which remains true today. Articles and headlines often contain emotional wording that favors the left, such as this

In 2022, they rarely publish new content but rather provide access to their 63-year history archives. Editorially, they have been progressive before the term became the official designation for more left-leaning Democrats. For example, they have long been promoters of gay marriage and often vilify conservatives for their stances, such as this
