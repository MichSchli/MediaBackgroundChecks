Analysis
[According](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-election-disinformation-exclus/exclusive-right-wing-sites-swamp-sweden-with-junk-news-in-tight-election-race-idUSKCN1LM0DN) to a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) article titled “Right-wing sites swamp Sweden with ‘junk news’ in tight election race,” Fria Tider was mentioned as one of the top three “junk news” sources. [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) identifies Fria Tider as among one of four [prominent far-right sites](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/europe/sweden-immigration-nationalism.html) with a quote that reads, “Fria Tider is considered not only one of the most extreme sites but also among the most Kremlin-friendly. It frequently swaps material with the Russian propaganda outlet [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/). The site is linked, via domain ownership records, to Granskning Sverige, called the Swedish “troll factory” for its efforts to entrap and embarrass mainstream journalists. Among its frequent targets: journalists who write negatively about Russia.”
Bias
In review, Fria Tider (Free Times) publishes daily news articles in the categories “The Front Page, Economy, Science, Culture and Opinion.” Most of the articles are presented with a strong right-leaning bias in reporting and wording with emotional language, such as this
[“Danish report: Third world immigrants are never integrated,”](https://www.friatider.se/dansk-rapport-tredje-varlden-invandrare-integreras-aldrig) and [“Refugee Minor Raped Host Family’s Daughter,” read another“](https://www.friatider.se/ensamkommande-misst-nks-f-r-barnv-ldt-kt-p-familjehemmets-dotter) or [“The AFA thugs in the US – this is what they look like.”](https://www.friatider.se/afa-ligisterna-i-usa-sa-har-ser-de-ut) When it comes to sourcing, they typically utilize right-leaning sites such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [The Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/), [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/), and [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). Many of the sources used on this website have failed fact checks and are rated Questionable.

Other topics include [anti-Marxism](https://www.friatider.se/orov-ckande-inblick-i-socialsverige), [climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and anti-feminist conspiracy theories such as [“Feminism drives Swedes to suicide](https://www.friatider.se/feminism-driver-svenskar-till-sj-lvmord).” Further, the [Swedish Media Council](https://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/c6460146d8de486eabf7f209b3a9093a/valdsbejakande-och-antidemokratiska-budskap-pa-internet) has stated that Fria Tider is “part of the radical right-wing populist online environment” and is considered to have “racist,” “xenophobic,” and “Islamophobic” content. In general, the Free Times is a far-right populist news source accused of publishing material that is considered questionable.
