Analysis / Bias
[On his LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradsaltzberg/?originalSubdomain=ca), Brad Salzberg described the mission of his website as “Cultural Action Party represent Canadian citizens who value, and wish to retain Canada’s traditional identity, heritage and official languages. We stand in direct opposition to globalist forces attempting to undermine and erode our nation’s unique cultural identity.
A review of the content reveals far-right nationalist editorial positions that are often opposed to immigration and promote white nationalism, such as this
[Anti-White Political Agenda Thriving In Canadian Public Schools](https://capforcanada.com/anti-white-political-agenda-thriving-in-canadian-public-schools/). CAP also promotes the fear of globalism like this [Jagmeet Singh: A One Trick Pony Act To Prop Up Justin Trudeau](https://capforcanada.com/jagmeet-singh-a-one-trick-pony-act-to-prop-up-pm-justin-trudeau/) where they state, “Singh’s NDP Party hold a mere 7% of seats in Parliament while maintaining the power to keep Canada locked in a prison of woke Liberal globalism.”
Further, they reject the consensus of science regarding climate change
[Colonialism, White Supremacy Blamed For Climate Change In Canada.](https://capforcanada.com/colonialism-white-supremacy-blamed-for-climate-change-in-canada/) Finally, CAP has promoted disinformation such as Covid-19 being a bioweapon created by China and [claiming](https://www.antihate.ca/far_right_coronavirus_conspiracies) “the Canadian government is pushing for the immigration of infected non-white and Muslim immigrants to wipe out “old stock” (read: white) Canadians.”
In general, this political party/website is far-right biased and frequently promotes disinformation, propaganda, pseudoscience, and conspiracy theories.
