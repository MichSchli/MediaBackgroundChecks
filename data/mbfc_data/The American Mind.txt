Analysis
In review, The American Mind produces news and commentary from a conservative perspective. The website breaks the content down into three categories: Features, Essays, and Discourses, with essays being long-form. Story selection almost always favors the right and uses moderate loaded language such as this:
[The Nation Is Not a Sin](https://americanmind.org/discourse/the-nation-is-not-a-sin/). This story is sourced to [Commonweal Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/commonweal-magazine/) and the factually mixed [First Things](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/first-things-magazine/).
Editorially, The American Mind frequently reports on immigration and holds a pro-Trump, right-wing approach:
[Citizenship, Immigration, and the Nation-State](https://americanmind.org/features/the-case-against-birthright-citizenship/citizenship-immigration-and-the-nation-state/). This story lightly suggests the conspiracy that a deep state exists with this quote: “The frenzy that has been generated by the progressive-liberal press, Hollywood radicals, progressive politicians (both Democrat and Republican), the minions of the deep state, and academics and law professors has been unprecedented.” Further, they routinely report favorably on the former [Trump administration](https://americanmind.org/features/winning-the-new-irrepressible-conflict/trump-vs-multiculturalist-insurrection/) and its policies.
Bias
In an essay written by President Ryan Williams titled
[Defend America—Defeat Multiculturalism](https://americanmind.org/essays/defend-america-defeat-multiculturalism/), there are hints of a white nationalist perspective. For example, a quote from the essay reads, “If we do not reverse multiculturalism’s advance, it will continue to undermine our country and constitutionalism, destroying the possibility of the common good and a life of civic peace. Indeed, multiculturalism threatens to take down western civilization as a whole.” The essay goes on to claim that “multiculturalists seek to erase and replace America.” This statement alludes to [Replacement Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Replacement), a white nationalist right-wing conspiracy theory that believes Other ethnic groups will replace European Whites.
Lastly, the Claremont Institute recently had an
[advertisement banned](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/googles-attack-on-the-claremont-institute-must-not-stand/) by Google for offering “racially or ethnically oriented publications.”
In general, the stories produced by The American Mind are very well written and usually reasonably sourced; however, we did find instances of stories that lacked hyperlinked sourcing or led to a Youtube video. Story selection favors neo-conservative positions.
