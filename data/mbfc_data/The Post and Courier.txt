John McCain in 2008, and President George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 general elections. In 2020, they did not endorse a candidate but continued to favor right-leaning candidates.
In review, The Post and Courier report news with minimal bias and balanced story coverage; however, there is a slight right-center editorial bias due to positions that favor the right. The Post and Courier are well-sourced as they use credible media outlets. They also won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015. Since this is a subscription-based Newspaper, we could only view a few articles and mainly relied on third-party research. Therefore, this is a medium confidence review. In general, they are a fact-based paper that leans right, but not enough to declare them as right-center because there is enough balance.
