Analysis / Bias
In review, Statista provides statistics from a wide variety of sources for data. There does not appear to be bias associated with this website. For example, you type in
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and you will get climate change stats from various sources, including those who do not go with the consensus. Quite simply, this is a valuable resource that provides stats. Some of the sources these stats come from may require scrutiny, but there is no bias here.
