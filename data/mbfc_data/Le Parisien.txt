This relationship raises questions about potential owner influence in shaping the newspaper’s coverage, especially on topics related to Macron or Arnault’s interests.
Upon reviewing the article titled
[“People don’t know the economy well,” Bernard Arnault brushes aside criticism of billionaires,](https://www.leparisien.fr/economie/les-gens-ne-connaissent-pas-bien-leconomie-bernard-arnault-balaye-les-critiques-sur-les-milliardaires-26-01-2023-QRCJ2CNNCFADZG5UQIXNGVJ7FY.php)” where Bernard Arnault disregards criticism towards billionaires. Arnault defends himself and his fellow billionaires by stating that those who criticize them often lack a proper understanding of economics. The article focuses solely on Arnault’s views and his company’s contributions, particularly in France, without presenting counterarguments.
This contrasts
[DW’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/) coverage of [Oxfam’s report](https://www.dw.com/en/oxfam-10-richest-men-in-the-world-doubled-wealth-amid-covid-pandemic/a-60443448), which highlights that the world’s wealthiest men increased their wealth during the pandemic and calls for measures to address this “economic violence.” Arnault’s ownership of Le Parisien likely influences its framing, as it omits the wealth inequality findings presented by Oxfam, a form of owner influence shaping the news narrative.

The article is straightforward and factual, presenting the interview details without editorializing or using biased language. The article cites the YouTube channel broadcasting the interview and quotes from official statements. It is factual, well-sourced, and does not exhibit noticeable bias. Despite Le Parisien being owned by Bernard Arnault, who has close ties with Macron, there is minimal evidence of ownership influence shaping the article’s narrative.
