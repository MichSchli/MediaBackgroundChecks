Analysis / Bias
Court TV covers court cases, police reports, and crime through outside sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and local news networks. They also provide broadcast coverage of high-profile court cases such as Johnny Depp vs. Amanda Herd and have an archive on court cases for streaming. Articles are fact-based with somewhat sensational headlines, such as this [4/28/22 BEAUTY QUEEN MURDER CASE: TRIAL AGAINST RYAN DUKE BEGINS MAY 2](https://www.courttv.com/title/4-28-22-beauty-queen-murder-case-trial-against-ryan-duke-begins-may-2/).
Editorially, they do not offer op-eds; however, when covering political cases, they remain neutral such as this
[A MORE CONSERVATIVE COURT HEARS SAME-SEX FOSTER PARENT CASE](https://www.courttv.com/news/a-more-conservative-court-hears-same-sex-foster-parent-case/). In general, they are fact-based with low bias in reporting.
