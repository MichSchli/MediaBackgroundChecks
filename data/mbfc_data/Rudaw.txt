Analysis / Bias
Iraqi Kurdistan is an autonomous region in Iraq and has a presidential system. The current President is Nechirvan Barzani whose party is the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) which is controlled by the Barzani tribe and described as a nationalist big tent party.
In a US Department of State
[2018 report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2018-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/iraq/) they describe the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) Media such as Rudaw as the Kurdistan Democratic Party’s (KDP) affiliate “In KDP strongholds, Kurdistan Television, Rudaw, and K24 had access to all public places and information.”
