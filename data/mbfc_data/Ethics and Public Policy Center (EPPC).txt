Editorially, almost all stories favor a conservative perspective with opposition to abortion, and the promotion of Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, such as this
[FDA Pushes To Authorize Novavax’s Covid-19 Vaccine Despite Serious Cardiovascular Safety Issues](https://eppc.org/publication/fda-pushes-to-authorize-novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-despite-serious-cardiovascular-safety-issues/).
