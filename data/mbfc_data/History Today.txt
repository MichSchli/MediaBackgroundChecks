Analysis / Bias
History Today exhibits a varied approach in its articles. While not following traditional academic citation formats, it references a range of sources, as seen in articles like “
[Cicero and the Power of Rhetoric](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/cicero-and-power-rhetoric),” “ [Turning Points in the Vietnam War](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/turning-points-vietnam-war),” and “ [Captain John Ward: Pirate.](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/captain-john-ward-pirate) While these articles do not include a traditional bibliography or explicit in-text citations, they reference various works and studies.
For instance, in the article about Cicero, several works are mentioned that have contributed to the understanding of Cicero’s writings and their impact. Similarly, the article about Captain John Ward discusses his notoriety and references sources like Venetian State Papers and the High Court of Admiralty records. Additionally, History Today maintains an online archive of articles published in its print magazine in previous years. The article about Captain John Ward was initially published in the February 1979 issue of History Today magazine. While History Today’s articles may not always follow the conventional academic citation format, they incorporate and discuss various sources and scholarly works. This narrative style caters to a broad audience beyond academic specialists.
However, in contemporary political pieces such as
[“Back to the Future: Donald Trump and the Debate Over American Decline”](https://www.historytoday.com/back-future-donald-trump-and-debate-over-american-decline) and [“Make America Great (Britain) Again!,”](https://www.historytoday.com/make-america-great-britain-again) the magazine uses emotionally loaded language, blending objective historical analysis with subjective commentary. This approach suggests a nuanced editorial stance, combining historical context with modern political analysis, which might lead to perceived bias. Additionally, the website’s [“US Presidents”](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/us_presidents) section does not currently include information on [President Joe Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/).
Concerning British politics, we analyzed the article
[“Boris Johnson’s Abuse of Churchill”](https://www.historytoday.com/boris-johnsons-abuse-churchill) by Felix Klos. The author’s perspective leans towards a pro-European Union stance, as it critiques Boris Johnson’s use of Winston Churchill’s legacy in support of Brexit, citing sources such as the [Daily Telegraph.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/#google_vignette)
In general, History Today incorporates a range of sources in its articles, usually from experts or academics who study history. However, its approach in contemporary political pieces may introduce some bias due to emotionally loaded language. It generally doesn’t exhibit a strong left or right bias but maintains a balanced editorial stance that combines historical context with modern political analysis.
