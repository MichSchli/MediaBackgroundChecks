History
Knights Templar International is a far-right news organization that is very pro-Christian and anti-Islam. They often refer to Muslim refugees as “
[Muslim Invaders](https://knightstemplarinternational.com/2016/09/muslims-want-eradicate-christianity-conquer-europe-claims-potential-next-pope/).” The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) considers Knights Templar International an [anti-Islamic hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/catholics-and-conspiracies).
About 1000 years ago, Templar Knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, were amongst the most skilled fighting units of the
[Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades). Today they are a hate group, as their last crusade was nearly [800 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Ruad).
On their
[ethos page](https://www.knightstemplarorder.com/ethos), they disclaim: “We are a Christian Organisation, and as such, we reject all forms of racism as anti-Biblical and reject all forms of political hatred no matter from what end of the political spectrum it comes from. We firmly believe in the dignity and humanity of all people regardless of color, creed, ethnicity, or political persuasion. This does not mean we necessarily agree with them or their beliefs. Still, as committed Christians, we are convinced of the principles of free speech, lawful assemble, and freedom of expression for all mankind without fear of persecution.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Knights Templar headquarters are based in Utah, with little details on ownership. A store that sells merchandise/battle equipment and donations fund the organization.
Analysis / Bias
The purpose of this review is not to explore their past but to see what they publish and advocate today. News and opinion stories often favor the right and use loaded emotional wording, such as this
[Dying Europe Votes to Kill More Babies](https://www.knightstemplarorder.com/dying_europe_votes_to_kill_more_babies), and anti-science propaganda, such as this [Young Swiss Reject Climate Change Madness](https://www.knightstemplarorder.com/young_swiss_reject_climate_change_madness). This latter story does not contain a hyperlinked source for its claims. The website often publishes stories highlighting Christian persecution, such as this [“It’s the Same the Whole World Over…”](https://www.knightstemplarorder.com/its_the_same_the_whole_world_over) When not reporting about Christian persecution or advocating [violence against Muslims](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2012/0418/Why-does-Norway-s-Breivik-invoke-the-Knights-Templar-video), they report other news with an extreme right bias that is not always factual.
Editorially, the primary issues they advocate for are anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-muslim propaganda.
