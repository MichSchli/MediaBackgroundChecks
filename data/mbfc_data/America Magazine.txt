Analysis / Bias
In review, America Magazine covers news and opinions from a Catholic perspective. There is minimal use of loaded words such as
[Five questions (and answers) about Brett Kavanaughâ€™s Supreme Court Nomination.](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2018/09/26/five-questions-and-answers-about-brett-kavanaughs-supreme-court) Articles are properly sourced to credible media outlets.
While they take somewhat conservative Catholic positions from an editorial standpoint, their news reporting has a slight left-center bias by favoring more liberal causes such as income equality and environmental protection.
