Analysis / Bias
In review, NewsNet TV is very similar to the now-defunct
[Headline News Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLN_(TV_network)), which features straightforward factual news reporting without adding commentary. This review, however, will focus on website content.
The website features news that is currently being played on the TV station. Each article has a low biased headline such as this:
[Mueller Testifies To Lawmakers About Russia Probe](http://yournewsnet.com/mueller-testifies-to-lawmakers-about-russia-probe/). The article content is a short summary of the story, that is again written with minimal bias. When reporting political news there very little bias in wording such as this: [Trump Administration Changing Portions of Citizenship Test](http://yournewsnet.com/trump-administration-changing-portions-of-citizenship-test/). This story does not provide commentary and sticks to the facts. In general, this is no-nonsense straight to the facts news reporting organization.
