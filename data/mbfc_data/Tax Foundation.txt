History
The Tax Foundation is an independent Washington, D.C.-based think tank
[founded in 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Foundation) that collects data and publishes research studies on U.S. tax policies at both the federal and state levels. They are cited as a nonpartisan or bipartisan organization by the media and business-friendly or conservative. However, they state we are an “independent tax policy research organization.” The current President is Scott A. Hodge.

Funded by / Ownership
The Tax Foundation is organized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit educational and research organization. They are primarily funded by corporate interests such as
[the Koch Brothers](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Koch_Family_Foundations#Contributions_of_the_Claude_R._Lambe_Foundation) and Exxon-Mobil. According to their website, in [2010](https://taxfoundation.org/tax-foundations-funding-sources/) (the last we could find), 33% of donations came from corporate sources.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Tax Foundation covers tax policy that advances a Libertarian agenda. Essentially, they advocate for
[lower taxes](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/tax-freedom-day/) and regulations on business. Articles and analyses on the website typically do not use loaded wording, such as this: [Tracking the Economic Impact of U.S. Tariffs and Retaliatory Actions](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trade/). This story is very well sourced from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and Whitehouse.gov. The website also features a blog that again uses minimally loaded language and sticks to the theme of low taxation: [Which Places Pay the Most in Property Taxes?](https://taxfoundation.org/county-property-tax-paid-2019/)
Although this is a right-leaning Libertarian think tank, they are sometimes critical of President Trump’s economic policies, such as this:
[Is Trump Supporting a Border Adjustment for the Wrong Reason?](https://taxfoundation.org/trump-border-adjustment-wrong-reason/) The Left-Leaning Center has criticized the Tax Foundation [ on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-center-on-budget-and-policy-priorities/) for [publishing misleading information.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/tax-foundation-figures-do-not-represent-typical-households-tax-burdens-2) When it comes to climate science, we could not find any instances of [climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); however, they also [do not advocate for regulation and Government involvement](https://taxfoundation.org/problem-using-carbon-taxes-combat-global-climate-change/), which is recommended by climate scientists and experts in the field. The information published on the Tax Foundation website is factual and correctly sourced; however, they occasionally publish misleading information.
