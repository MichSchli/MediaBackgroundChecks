Analysis / Bias
The New Humanist publishes news that focuses on culture, news, philosophy, and science from a skeptical perspective. Articles and headlines are well-sourced but do not contain hyperlinks because this is a print magazine. Headlines also describe the contents of the story, such as this
[How the fear of death gave birth to religion](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5282/how-the-fear-of-death-gave-birth-to-religion).
Editorially, many stories are opposed to religion as they are not related to evidence-based science, such as this
[Why is an anti-homophobia bill being fought by the Vatican?](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5835/why-is-an-anti-homophobia-bill-being-fought-by-the-vatican) Some may think being opposed to religious dogma is a left-leaning perspective, but it is a free-thinking perspective that does not have left or right bias. In general, all information is factual.
