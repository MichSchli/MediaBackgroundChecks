Analysis / Bias
Interfax-Ukraine utilizes emotionally loaded language in its headlines, such as
[“EU leaders again condemn Russian aggression against Ukraine, say Russia must immediately, unconditionally withdraw its troops.”](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/899535.html) Typically, Interfax-Ukraine sources news through interviews or local sources by quoting large blocks of text, such as [“Zelenskyy: We are at crucial stage of battle for Ukraine](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/899694.html).”
The article titled
[Green Deal and the Great War. Will the Russian invasion hinder Ukraine’s “green” ambitions?”](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/blog/897775.html) contains a statement that aligns with a left-leaning perspective. The quote from the article reads: “Ukraine, as an integral part of the European community, will act in unison with the European Union in matters of combating the consequences of climate change, as well as creating new opportunities for Ukrainian business.” In general, Interfax-Ukraine holds a left-leaning editorial bias and earns a mixed factual rating due to poor sourcing techniques and a lack of transparency.
