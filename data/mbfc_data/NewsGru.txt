Analysis / Bias
NewsGru primarily publishes financial news about crypto-currencies and related information. They also cover general news and politics. NewsGru rarely uses loaded language in their headlines and articles such as this:
[North Korea reconnects to South Korea, reopens line of communication](https://newsgru.com/north-korea-reconnects-south-korea-reopens-line-communication/). However, they poorly source information as they do not use hyperlinking when sourcing to outside information. Typically, they utilize quotes, which is not appropriate for a web-only publication. When covering politics, NewGru moderately favors the left: [Americans aiming to escape Donald Trump can move to Canada](https://newsgru.com/americans-aiming-escape-donald-trump-can-move-canada/).
