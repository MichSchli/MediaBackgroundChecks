Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Institute for Economic Research is the Bastiat Society’s home, a global network of business professionals committed to advancing free trade, individual freedom, and responsible governance. While AIER does not openly state its support for the
[Austrian Economic Theory](http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=Austrian-economics) (limited government interference), many articles endorse it. Headlines do not use loaded language, and articles are properly sourced, such as this [Consumer Sentiment and Job Openings Show Improvement](https://aier.org/article/consumer-sentiment-and-job-openings-show-improvement). This article is appropriately sourced from [Thomson Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/thomson-reuters-foundation/). AIER reports negatively on [progressive economic policy](https://www.aier.org/article/sneaky-ways-democratic-house-can-raise-taxes) as well as former [President Trump’s policy](https://www.aier.org/article/president-trumps-first-year-included-setbacks-liberty).
When it comes to scientific issues, AIER does not deny the human impact on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and supports the consensus of science; however, they do not support a government solution approach: [How a Strong Private Sector Will Address Climate Change](https://www.aier.org/article/how-strong-private-sector-will-address-climate-change). However, during the Coronavirus outbreak of 2020, they have published claims that are in [dispute](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/health/coronavirus-great-barrington.html). In general, AIER endorses a Libertarian point of view.
Failed Fact Checks
[Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 never occurs](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/asymptomatic-and-presymptomatic-people-can-spread-covid-19-jeffrey-a-tucker-aier/)– Inaccurate
A Senior Research Fellow at AIER asked us to review the above fact check as they felt it was in error and misattributed to them. The author of the story, Jeffrey A. Tucker, states in the
[article](https://archive.is/Zvomv#selection-1589.0-1589.106), “With solid evidence that asymptomatic spread is nonsense, we have to ask: who is making decisions and why?” Mr. Tucker references a study by [Cao ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w)et al. that reveals [out of 300 asymptomatic cases, none were infectious](https://www.uea.ac.uk/news/-/article/wuhan-mass-screening-identifies-hundreds-of-asymptomatic-cases). However, Prof Fujian Song, a corresponding author of the research, said of the study, “There is plenty of evidence elsewhere showing that people infected with COVID-19 may be temporarily asymptomatic and infectious before going on to develop symptoms.”
Furthermore, Health Feedback, directly states that AIER’s statement is from one of two articles they are fact-checking where they report and provide hyperlinks to the AIER article: “These claims appeared on websites, such as the American Institute for Economic Research
[website](https://archive.is/Zvomv) and this [blog](https://archive.is/o7DIu). Both rely on a [research paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w) by Cao et al. published in Nature Communications in November 2020 as evidence.
Through cherry-picking one small study that even the study authors state does not tell the whole story, Mr. Tucker concluded, “Forget rare. Forget even Fauci’s previous suggestion that asymptomatic transmission exists but does not drive the spread. Replace all that with: never.” Based on his statements that asymptomatic transmission is “nonsense” and that asymptomatic transmission “never” occurs based on this one study, we conclude that the Health Feedback fact check is accurate and correctly attributes AIER through a hyperlink to their archived article.
