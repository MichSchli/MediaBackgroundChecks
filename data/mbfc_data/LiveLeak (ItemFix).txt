History
Liveleak (ItemFix) is a video service co-founded by
[Hayden Hewitt](https://www.businessinsider.com/profile-of-hayden-hewitt-founder-of-liveleak-2014-10) in 2006. The content is almost exclusively user-submitted videos and covers a wide range of topics from around the world. From people’s pets to Rex Tillerson’s trip to Asia. ItemFix lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership.
In 2021, LiveLeak shut down and now redirects to ItemFix.com, which appears to be a less violent and gory version of the video upload site.

Analysis / Bias
In review, due to being a video sharing service, and the videos being presented as submitted, the content can be very graphic and controversial, such as when Liveleak hosted footage of the beheading of journalist James Foley by ISIS in 2014. Mr. Hewitt has defended the practice of presenting submitted footage as is, stating in his own words:
“Look all this is happening, this is real life, this is going on, and we’re going to show it.”
Liveleak also has a video content-sharing agreement with
[Ruptly](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ruptly/), state-run [Russia Today’s](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) video service, which is both right-biased and questionable. While most of the content is apolitical, we found many videos depicting Muslims negatively. They have also published false and misleading information as seen below in the fact checks. In general, the content of videos is mostly non-political, but there does appear to be a right-leaning bias when depicting Muslims.
ItemFix still publishes videos showing car crashes and fights but
[bans](https://www.itemfix.com/faq) users from uploading media containing “excessive violence or gory content.”
