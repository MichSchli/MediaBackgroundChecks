Fusion also publishes satire, which can make it difficult to tell which is real or not.

Funded by / Ownership
Fusion TV is a part of
[Splinter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/splinter/), which is owned by [G/O Media Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G/O_Media). which is a media company that runs [Gizmodo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gizmodo/), [Kotaku](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kotaku/), [Jezebel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jezebel/), [The Onion](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-onion/) and other sister websites.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Fusion publishes video clips from Univision that tends to have left leaning bias in content that frequently reports negatively on
[President Trump](https://fusion.tv/show/unews/). In general, video content is factual and left biased, though they cover a wide range of news and therefore fall within the left-center category.
