History
[Founded in 2007](http://whois.domaintools.com/bipartisanpolicy.org), and according to their [about page](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/about/who-we-are/): “The Bipartisan Policy Center is a non-profit organization that combines the best ideas from both parties to promote health, security, and opportunity for all Americans. BPC drives principled and politically viable policy solutions through the power of rigorous analysis, painstaking negotiation, and aggressive advocacy.” BPC was founded by former Senate Majority Leaders [Howard Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Baker), [Tom Daschle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daschle), [Bob Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dole), and [George J. Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Mitchell). The founding and the current president is Jason Grumet.
BPC partners with a political action committee called
[BPC Action](https://bpcaction.org/about-us/). BPC Action is “committed to seeing bipartisan policy solutions enacted into law” and “[works] closely with [its] 501(c)(3) partner, the Bipartisan Policy Center, to advance smart policies; through the legislative process.”
They are transparent and offer a page dedicated to their
[team](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/team/) but are not transparent with funding. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Bipartisan Policy Center is a
[501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Policy_Center#cite_note-16). Revenue is derived through donations. [According](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/bipartisan-policy-center/) to the right-leaning [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/), The Bipartisan Policy Center has received funding from left-leaning donors such as [Carnegie Corporation,](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/carnegie-corporation-of-new-york/) [Democracy Fund](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/democracy-fund/), and the [McKnight Foundation](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/mcknight-foundation/).
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Bipartisan Policy Center features an equal number of Democrat and Republican members. However, their policy leans right as they favor free-market capitalism in policy selection, except for health care. For example, they have been
[criticized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/15/at-the-bipartisan-policy-center-is-cash-the-real-divide/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9fe8b1babf6a) by a former member who claims the organization is beholden to corporate interests. Bipartisan Policy Center also favors drilling and the continued use of fossil fuels.
According to
[RightWeb,](https://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/bipartisan_policy_center/) BPC is also hawkish militarily and has connections with the [American Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-enterprise-institute/) and the [Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/). However, according to Open Secrets, BPC gave [significantly more money](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000047798&cycle=2014) to Democratic candidates in 2018. BPC does not use loaded language, and all articles are properly sourced. In general, BPC very slightly leans right but does offer left-leaning perspectives.
