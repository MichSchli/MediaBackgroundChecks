History
Founded in 2022, TrendingPoliticsNews.com is a hyper-partisan conservative news and opinion website. They fully disclose their bias on the
[about page](https://trendingpoliticsnews.com/about/): “Welcome to TrendingPolitics, where we provide conservative commentary on the news stories of the day. Studies have shown that 90%+ of the stories about Conservatives are negative, so we like to bring the other side of the story to you. With that being said, we aren’t shy to admit we’re biased. The majority of our articles will have a good amount of Conservative opinion weaved into it.”
The about page information above is identical to that on
[TrendingPolitics.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trending-politics/). They do not disclose editors and authors have limited biographical information. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, TrendingPoliticsNews.com rarely publishes original reporting but rather offers commentary on news stories from other sources. Headlines and wording of articles often use emotionally loaded language such as this:
[BREAKING: Elon Musk Exposes Adam Schiff for Colluding With Twitter](https://trendingpoliticsnews.com/breaking-elon-musk-exposes-adam-schiff-for-colluding-with-twitter/). This story is unsourced. Regarding sourcing information, they use a combination of credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and poor sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Defiant America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/defiant-america/). Again, they rarely provide hyperlinks to the original sources. They also provide a news feed from the Questionable source [Patriot Fetch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/patriot-fetch-bias/).
Editorially, story selection always favors the right and typically reports on former President Trump positively:
[The REAL Insurrection: Trump Explodes on Biden Border Disaster](https://trendingpoliticsnews.com/the-real-insurrection-trump-explodes-on-biden-border-disaster-wiley/) and negatively on liberals such as this, [Pelosi Has a “Senior Moment” with Embarassing Gaffe in Final Speech [WATCH]](https://trendingpoliticsnews.com/pelosi-has-a-senior-moment-with-embarassing-gaffe-in-final-speech-wiley/).
TrendingPoliticsNews.com also indirectly promotes conspiracy theories such as this:
[Trump BLOWS UP on Fake News Media, Jan 6th Committee in Epic String of Truth Posts](https://trendingpoliticsnews.com/trump-blows-up-on-fake-news-media-jan-6th-committee-in-epic-string-of-truth-posts/). In this article, they repeat false claims made by former President Trump “Isn’t it INCREDIBLE that the people who Cheated, Rigged, and Stole the 2020 Presidential Election.” This is false as [there is no evidence the election was stolen.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118)
In general, TrendingPoliticsNews.com is more credible than TrendingPolitics.com but still is questionable based on a lack of transparency, poor sourcing techniques, and the promotion of right-leaning propaganda and conspiracy theories.
