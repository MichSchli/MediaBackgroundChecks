Analysis / Bias
In review, BNR Nieuwsradio utilizes minimally loaded language both in their headlines and articles such as
[“UK SHARES ON SALE AFTER BREXIT.”](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/financieel/10445941/britse-aandelen-in-uitverkoop-na-brexit) When reporting on national political news, they use more emotional language that favors the pro-business right, such as this [“FIFTEEN YEARS PVV” ](https://www.bnr.nl/podcast/jaapjansen/10389324/vijftien-jaar-pvv) (PVV or Partij voor de Vrijheid, is a far-right party) and [“PVDA LASHES OUT AT BUSINESS”](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/politiek/10432969/pvda-haalt-uit-naar-bedrijfsleven) (PvdA is a center-left party and PvdA stands for Partij van de Arbeid, or the Labour Party). A quote reads, “Party leader Lilianne Ploumen lashed out extremely hard at the business community.”
Since BNR reports on business from the perspective of business people, they tend to be critical of the Labor party. Furthermore, while the wording of the articles is generally neutral, BNR
[accepts](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/hoofdredactioneel/10318416/open-brief-aan-geert-wilders) the right-wing anti-immigrant and nationalist positions of the PVV party headed by Geert Wilders. In general, the content appears to be factual; however, there is very little hyperlinked sourcing to validate the claims.
