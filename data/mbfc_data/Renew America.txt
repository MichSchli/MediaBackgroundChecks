History
[Founded in 2002](http://www.renewamerica.com/about.htm) as a website to support Republican Alan Keyes, Renew America is an extreme right Christian news and opinion website. According to their [about page](http://www.renewamerica.com/about.htm): “Renew America is a grassroots organization that supports the self-evident truths found in the Declaration of Independence, and their faithful application through upholding the U.S. Constitution, as written. Its purpose is to thoughtfully and courageously advance the cause of our nation’s Founders.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Renew America does not clearly state ownership on the website, thereby lacking transparency. There also does not appear to be a clear means of funding and revenue generation.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Renew America presents information with an extreme right-wing bias that always favors the right. The authors frequently use questionable and/or far-right sources in their articles. Renew America does not support the consensus of science on many issues such as
[climate change](https://web.archive.org/web/20120720192704/http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mostert/080719) and [evolution](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/hutchison/130110). They also promote far-right conspiracies such as Obama being a secret [Muslim](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/swank/110209) and [birtherism](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/sfarrell/110409). They also promote [abortion](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/childress/110222) as black genocide. Further, one of their writers Bryan Fischer has been labeled [anti-LGBT](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/bryan-fischer) by the SPLC. In general, this website aggregates to other sources that have poor track records such as [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/), [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/), and [Sean Hannity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIEA7U_T8WA) who have a horrible track record with fact-checking.
