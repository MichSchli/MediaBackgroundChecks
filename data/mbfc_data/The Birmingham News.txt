Analysis / Bias
The Birmingham News covers local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this
[Shootout on Birmingham’s busy Finley Blvd. leaves 1 dead, 2 hurt in city’s 133rd homicide of the year](https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2022/12/shootout-on-birminghams-busy-finley-boulevard-leaves-1-dead-2-injured-in-citys-133rd-homicide-of-the-year.html). National and international news is covered through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they have a slight right-leaning bias and employ known right-leaning columnists, such as Cameron Smith, Vice President of the
[R Street Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/r-street-institute/), a conservative and libertarian think tank based in Washington, D.C. They generally report the news factually and with a moderate conservative bias.
