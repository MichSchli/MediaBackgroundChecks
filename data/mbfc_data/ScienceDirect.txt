Funded by / Ownership
ScienceDirect is owned and published by
[Elsevier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier), a Dutch information and analytics company and one of the world’s foremost scientific, technical, and medical information providers. It was established in 1880 as a publishing company. Article abstracts are freely available, but access to their full texts (in PDF and, for newer publications, and HTML) generally requires a subscription or pay-per-view purchase.
Analysis / Bias
In review, ScienceDirect allows you to search a massive database of peer-reviewed journals, articles, book chapters, and open access content. There is zero political bias associated with ScienceDirect. The only blemish is that Open Access research can lack peer review; however, Open Access content is clearly labeled, so the reader is aware that it may not be peer-reviewed. In general, this is a fantastic tool for searching scientific research and information; however, caution must be used as some research is not peer-reviewed.
