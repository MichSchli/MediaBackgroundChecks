History
[Asian Correspondent](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/hybrid-a-collection-of-targeted-news-sites-in-asia-embraces-growing-slowly-and-knowing-its-audience/) is a Bristol, UK-based news website launched in 2009, by Hybrid News Limited, which was founded by James Craven. He describes Asian correspondent as “started as a bit of blogging project, got bigger.” The [Asian Correspondent](https://asiancorrespondent.com/2011/03/asian-correspondent-chief-on-the-business-of-blogging-seo-censorship-finding-new-writers/) website provides commentary, opinion and combines articles by bloggers and newswire content in one website, geared primarily towards an Asian audience. The website covers all of the Asia–Pacific region. Asian Correspondent’s format led to a comparison with the Huffington Post and has been [described](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2009/11/02/asian-correspondent-taps-into-regions-blogosphere-to-fill-foreign-newshole/) as the HuffPo for Asia. [Clara Chooi](https://asiancorrespondent.com/author/clara-chooi/) is the Editor-in-Chief. [Read our report on UK government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Asian Correspondent re-publishes articles from
[credible wire services](https://asiancorrespondent.com/author/reutersnews/) such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Furthermore, Asian Correspondent sources to other credible media outlets such as [The Straits Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-straits-times/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [South China Morning Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-china-morning-post/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and [News.com.au](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-com-au/) when covering world news such as in this article: [‘Least affordable’ Hong Kong aims to sell ‘cheap’ homes”.](https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/12/least-affordable-hong-kong-aims-to-sell-cheap-homes/) Asian Correspondent also uses minimally biased emotional language in their headlines such as [“From famine to fortune: A timeline of China’s economic turnaround.”](https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/12/from-famine-to-fortune-a-timeline-of-chinas-economic-turnaround/) When covering US News, they utilize neutral language as well: “ [Could Trump and Xi’s ‘good’ chat spell an end to the US-China trade war?”](https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/11/could-trump-and-xis-good-chat-spell-an-end-to-the-us-china-trade-war/) Within this article there is a mild anti-Trump tone as evidenced by this quote “Trump, however, tends to take a more freestyle approach to such meetings, relying more on gut-feeling than any prepared standpoints.”
Politically, Asian Correspondent is left-leaning when it comes to environmental issues with sections of the website
[dedicated](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) to [climate change news](https://asiancorrespondent.com/topic/climate-change/), as well as a section called “ [Green](https://asiancorrespondent.com/section/green/)” that publishes news related to green energy and conservation.
