Analysis / Bias
In review, the tagline is appropriate, however these friends who are ranting are from the left side of aisle. All articles reviewed favor the left and used strong loaded language in opposition to Donald Trump and the right in general. For example this headline:
[Banana Republicans Are Playing a Very Cynical Game](https://extranewsfeed.com/the-gop-is-playing-a-very-cynical-game-2fa1f2ef54). Sourcing on ExtraNewsFeed is hit and miss. Some articles are well sourced to credible media and others not at all. ExtraNewsFeed also publishes satire that they clearly label such as this: [Trump Rallies Rednecks For Civil War If He’s Removed From Office](https://extranewsfeed.com/trump-rallies-rednecks-for-civil-war-if-hes-removed-from-office-a173857f1554). In general, ExtraNewsFeed favors the left and denigrates the right.
