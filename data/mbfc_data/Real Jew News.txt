Analysis / Bias
RJN is not a news site and consists entirely of the writings of Mr. Kapner. The writings purport to expose the worldwide Zionist conspiracy. They are heavily prejudicial, are not factual, and contain little more than conjecture. The website essentially blames anything wrong in the world on Jews—everything from 9/11 to proclaiming that the antichrist will be a Jew. The only proper description for this website is SICK. They are a one-person hate group.
Failed Fact Checks
- They have never been fact-checked, but virtually everything is false or a conspiracy theory.
