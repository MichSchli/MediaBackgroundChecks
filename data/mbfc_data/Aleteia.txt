History
[Founded in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleteia) by the Foundation for Evangelization through the Media, Aleteia is a Catholic news and information website. The President of the foundation is Olivier Bonnassies. According to their [about page](https://aleteia.org/about-us/), “Aleteia (aleteia.org) is an online publication distributed in eight languages (English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Polish, and Slovenian). The Aleteia site offers a Christian vision of the world by providing general and religious content that is free from ideological influences.”
In July 2015, the Média-Participations Group became Aleteia’s industrial operator. Since then, Aleteia has “developed a new editorial strategy focused primarily on information and lifestyle.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Aleteia reports news from a Catholic perspective that covers various topics ranging from News, Spirituality, Lifestyle, Art & Travels, and more. Under the News category, they report general news, some of which is political, such as this:
[Missouri is the latest state to enact strict abortion ban](https://aleteia.org/2019/05/17/missouri-is-latest-state-to-enact-strict-abortion-ban/). This story is written with minimal bias as the author does not interject personal opinions but rather sources to the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) Under the Spirituality category, they have stories that would be classified as pseudoscience, such as this: [Cover your children with God’s protection with this prayer from the Bible](https://aleteia.org/2019/05/14/cover-your-children-with-gods-protection-with-this-prayer-from-the-bible/). While prayer is a fundamental concept in most religions, there isn’t evidence that [prayer has any effect on outcomes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-faith-healing/) and, hence is considered a pseudoscience.
Politically, Aleteia leans right with opposition to gay marriage, with articles like this:
[After Gay Marriage, Is Polyamory (Group Marriage) Next?](https://aleteia.org/2015/06/08/after-gay-marriage-is-polyamory-group-marriage-next/) On the other hand, they have a left-leaning pro-science perspective regarding [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/): [Is climate change increasing suicide risk?](https://aleteia.org/2018/08/14/is-climate-change-increasing-suicide-risk/) In general, the political views of Aleteia are in line with the Catholic Church: [Abortion Law Insanity: Killing Babies is Murder, but Killing Full-Term Fetuses is “Choice](https://aleteia.org/2014/11/25/abortion-law-insanity-killing-babies-is-murder-but-killing-full-term-fetuses-is-choice/).” In total, Aleteia reports straight news with minimal bias; however, when it comes to social issues and opinions, they lean strongly right, upholding the values of the Catholic Church.
