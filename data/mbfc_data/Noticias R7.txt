Analysis / Bias
In review, the article titled
[“Cúpula do Brics confirma a ampliação do grupo e anuncia seis novos países no bloco”](https://noticias.r7.com/brasilia/cupula-do-brics-confirma-a-ampliacao-de-grupo-e-anuncia-seisnovos-paises-no-bloco-24082023) discusses the expansion of the BRICS group to include six new countries. The article cites official statements, announcements, or references to itself for sourcing. The tone is neutral, and the word choice exhibits no noticeable bias.
The second article,
[“Bolsonaro critica Lula por petista ter pedido soltura de sequestradores de Abílio Diniz,”](https://noticias.r7.com/brasilia/bolsonaro-critica-lula-por-petista-ter-pedido-soltura-de-sequestradores-de-abilio-diniz-29062022?lista_especial=Lula) discusses Bolsonaro’s criticism of former President Lula regarding the kidnapping of businessman Abílio Diniz. The article leans more towards a pro-Bolsonaro stance, particularly how it frames Lula’s actions and motives. The article includes direct quotes from both Bolsonaro and Lula. While the article includes Lula’s explanation for his actions, it is framed within Bolsonaro’s criticism, which could be seen as giving more weight to Bolsonaro’s right-leaning viewpoint, giving more weight to Bolsonaro’s perspective.
In general, Noticias R7 is mostly fact-based and holds a right-leaning editorial bias.
