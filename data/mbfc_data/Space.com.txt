Analysis / Bias
In review, Space.com covers developments in space, physics, technology, and astronomy. Space.com does not offer original news, but rather summarizes news stories from other sources. News is reported with some emotional wording in headlines, but the body of content is generally pro-science such as this:
[A TV satellite is about to explode following ‘irreversible’ battery damage](https://www.space.com/exploding-directv-satellite-graveyard-orbit.html). Space.com always sources its information and does not provide significant editorial bias. For example, when reporting on Trump, they stick with the genre and focus on science issues such as this: [Trump Launches US Space Command to Control the ‘Next Warfighting Domain’](https://www.space.com/trump-launches-us-space-command.html).
