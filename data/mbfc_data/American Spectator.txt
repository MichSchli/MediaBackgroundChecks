History
[Founded in 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Spectator), The American Spectator is a conservative website that until 2014 was a U.S. monthly magazine covering news and politics, edited by R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr. and published by the non-profit American Spectator Foundation. The former magazine and now website carries articles by notable conservative writers such as Thomas Sowell, Ben Stein, P.J. O’Rourk, and Patrick Buchanan. According to their [about page](https://spectator.org/about/), “The American Spectator Foundation educates the public on new ideas, concepts, and policies that favor traditional American values, such as economic freedom, individual liberty, self-sufficiency, and limited government.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Spectator reports news with a conservative bias. There is the moderate use of emotionally loaded language such as this:
[The Death of the Democratic Party](https://spectator.org/the-death-of-the-democratic-party/). This opinion piece, which is not labeled as such, contains zero sourcing. As an online publication, there should be hyperlinks provided to support claims. In another article from their blog [Immigration: Trump’s on the Right Track,](https://spectator.org/immigration-trumps-on-the-right-track/) there is again a complete lack of sourcing. We found some that were appropriately linked to credible media outlets by reviewing dozens of articles, but not many. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left. Editorially, the American Spectator favors former President Donald Trump, such as this: [The Reelection of Donald Trump](https://spectator.org/the-reelection-of-donald-trump/). When it comes to the science of [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they do not align with the consensus of science, which they make clear in [this article](https://spectator.org/confessions-of-a-climate-change-denier/).
