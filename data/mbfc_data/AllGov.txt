History
Founded in 2009, “
[AllGov.com](http://www.allgov.com/about-us) provides up-to-date news about more than [340 departments and agencies of the U.S. government](http://www.allgov.com/departments), most of which operate under the radar of the media, even when they have annual budgets of billions of dollars. AllGov tells you what each agency says it does, what it really does, and who is making a profit from the agency. It also gives a history of the agency, illuminates controversies relating to the agency, and shares critiques and suggested reforms from both the left and the right.” The founder and editor-in-chief is [David Wallechinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wallechinsky), an American populist historian and television commentator.

Analysis / Bias
In review, AllGov is a valuable resource when searching for information about government agencies and those in charge of them. AllGov does not use loaded language, and everything is impeccably sourced to credible media or .gov/.org sites. Allgov covers both sides equally, and there is little sign of bias in reporting on departments and agencies. However, the website also reports general political news, most of which is written by David Wallechnisky.
These articles are often very critical of the Trump administration and frequently use loaded emotional language such as this:
[Trump’s Obsession with Venezuela and Iran in One Chart](http://www.allgov.com/news/us-and-the-world/trumps-obsession-with-venezuela-and-iran-in-one-chart?news=860508). A quote from the article reads: “For all the talk of Trump being Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lapdog, he is also aggressively promoting the agenda of the Saudi royal family.” AllGov also republishes articles from [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/). Finally, AllGov publishes Satire mixed into their newsfeed, which can be misleading. However, the article itself is appropriately labeled as Satire. Here is an example: [Trump Claims God Told Him to Deport his Wife, Melania](http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/trump-claims-god-told-him-to-deport-his-wife-melania?news=860510).
