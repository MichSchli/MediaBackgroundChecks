Analysis / Bias
In review, The Vancouver Province reports local and regional news through journalists with minimal loaded words like this:
[Several arrested after alleged abduction in Port Moody ends in rescue operation](https://theprovince.com/news/local-news/several-arrested-after-port-moody-abduction-ended-rescue-operation/wcm/28719ba2-92c6-4916-a6be-735e45ccfd7a). The national news is derived primarily from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) and [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/), whereas world news comes from multiple sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Generally, straight news reporting is factual and presents minimal biased wording; however, story selection tends to lean right.
Editorially, there is a clear right-leaning bias with commentaries. While the Vancouver Province does offer opposing viewpoints, on the whole, more editorials favor the conservative right.
