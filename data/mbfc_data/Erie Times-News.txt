Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered via field journalists and national/world news through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). There is minimal use of [loaded language](http://www.goerie.com/news/20180818/transformer-fire-leaves-1200-millcreek-penelec-customers-without-service) in headlines, and all information is reasonably sourced.
Editorially, the Erie Times-News endorses a mixed bag of candidates; however, analysis reveals slightly more endorsements for Democrats. In the 2016 Presidential Election, they
[endorsed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_endorsements_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016) Democrat Hillary Clinton. Op-eds have a reasonable balance.
