History
Founded in 1897, The Forward, formerly known as The Jewish Daily Forward, was an American magazine published monthly in New York City for a Jewish-American audience.
[In 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forward), they ceased publication of the print edition and went to direct online publishing. The Forward covers international and national news as well as stories of interest to the Jewish-American communities. The current editor-in-chief is Jodi Rudoren.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Forward provides original reporting on news, politics, Jewish-American celebrities, and anti-semitism for a Jewish-American audience. Articles and headlines use loaded emotional wording such as this
[‘Rome is burning’: Jewish groups seek to bypass infighting over antisemitism](https://forward.com/news/463390/rome-is-burning-jewish-groups-seek-to-bypass-infighting-over-antisemitism/). This story like most is properly sourced. They also report on prominent Jewish Americans such as Bernie Sanders: [Bernie Sanders says he’s proud to be Jewish. Will Jewish voters care?](https://forward.com/opinion/440031/bernie-sanders-says-hes-proud-to-be-jewish-will-jewish-voters-care/). The Forward also republishes news from [Haaretz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/haaretz/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and the [Jewish Telegraphic Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency-jta/).
Editorially, they offer a mix of opinions with some favoring right-leaning Benjamin Netanyahu, and others that are very critical such as this
[Netanyahu Just Invited Israel’s Equivalent Of The KKK To Join The Government](https://forward.com/opinion/419676/netanyahu-just-invited-israels-kkk-to-join-the-government-american-jews/). With USA politics, they hold a negative view of former President Donald Trump, such as this [Trump Keeps White Supremacist Donations To 2020 Campaign](https://forward.com/news/406833/trump-keeps-white-supremacist-donations-to-2020-campaign/) and a positive view of current President Joe Biden [Enough for a minyan: A Jewish Who’s Who of Biden’s Cabinet-to-Be](https://forward.com/news/462330/enough-for-a-minyan-a-jewish-whos-who-of-bidens-cabinet-to-be/). A review of dozens of op-eds shows that they tend to lean left, but they report news factually.
