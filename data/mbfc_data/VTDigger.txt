Analysis / Bias
VTDigger publishes original news, investigations, and analysis related to Vermont government. Articles and headlines do not use loaded emotional wording such as this
[Burlington councilors hope to revive the effort to allow legal residents to vote in city elections](https://vtdigger.org/2022/07/24/burlington-councilors-hope-to-revive-effort-to-allow-legal-residents-to-vote-in-city-elections/). The website also reports on general news such as this [Police say Burlington man trapped in car for 12 hours off I-89](https://vtdigger.org/2022/07/22/police-say-burlington-man-trapped-in-car-for-12-hours-off-i-89/). All information is credibly sourced from first-hand accounts, documents, memos, and state reports.
Editorially, VTDigger investigates corruption and holds all public officials accountable regardless of the political party. For example, in 2016, they uncovered that Jane Sanders (Wife of Senator Bernie Sanders) overstated donation amounts to Burlington College
[Jane Sanders overstated donation amounts in loan application for Burlington College](https://vtdigger.org/2015/09/13/jane-sanders-overstated-donation-amounts-in-loan-application-for-burlington-college/). However, when reviewing the website, they usually investigate and report on issues favorable to the left, such as concern for climate change [Updated Lake Champlain cleanup plan focuses on climate change, environmental justice](https://vtdigger.org/2022/06/03/updated-lake-champlain-cleanup-plan-focuses-on-climate-change-environmental-justice/), and racial equity [VTDigger announces new Underwriting for Racial Equity Project](https://vtdigger.org/2022/06/19/vtdigger-announces-new-underwriting-for-racial-equity-project/). In general, VTDigger is factual and leans left editorially.
