Analysis / Bias
In review, Caldron Pool does not perform original news reporting but rather takes existing stories from other sources and editorializes them from a Christian Right perspective. Further, they do not distinguish whether the content is an opinion or straight news reporting. Headlines and articles often contain emotionally loaded wording that favors the right such as this:
[The double-standards of liberals](https://caldronpool.com/the-double-standards-of-liberals/). This story is sourced from tweets. However, other stories on the website are generally sourced properly.
Editorially, Caldron Pool frequently reports negatively on
[LGBTQ](https://caldronpool.com/president-of-brazil-to-ban-lgbtq-ideology-in-schools-and-revise-marxist-textbooks-for-the-full-protection-of-children/), [abortion](https://caldronpool.com/director-of-australias-largest-abortion-provider-says-banning-sex-selection-abortion-discriminates-against-multicultural-communities/), and most often liberals with loaded emotional [quotes such as this](https://caldronpool.com/profiteering-from-falsehood-proof-that-leftist-australian-media-needs-a-narrative-of-racism-and-oppression-to-stay-relevant/): “This only serves division, and shows that the Leftist cult of modern liberalism in Australia needs a narrative of oppression, racism, and bigotry, just to appear relevant.” When reporting on LGBTQ, they often [report fearfully](https://caldronpool.com/is-disneys-frozen-desensitizing-and-entire-generation-of-young-girls-to-lgbtq-ideology/) about the acceptance and normalization of LGBTQ by the media and educational institutions (conspiracy). When it comes to science, this source does not always support the scientific consensus on topics such as climate change, evolution, and [Covid-19 vaccines](https://caldronpool.com/romanian-eu-representatives-expose-culture-of-silence-on-vaccines-big-pharma-deals-and-vaccine-mandates/) (pseudoscience). In general, Caldron Pool publishes news and information that appeals to the far Christian Right.
