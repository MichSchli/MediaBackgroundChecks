History
[Founded in 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/bluenewsnetwork.com), Blue News Network is Satire website created by police officers. According to their [about page](https://bluenewsnetwork.com/about/): “We are just a few bored cops who thought we would make sport of triggering people and having a little fun at the expense of rookies, dispatchers, and troopers. If you don’t like what we are doing here, I am sorry to tell you that we do not care. Have a great life, and stress less about the things you cannot control, like what we write on this site.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The website does not disclose ownership, though
[MiketheCop](https://bluenewsnetwork.com/author/mikethecop/) does all of the posting. There does not appear to be funding for this website. Too bad. It is pretty funny!
Analysis / Bias
In review, BNN fully discloses they are a satire site
[here](https://bluenewsnetwork.com/about/): “If you haven’t figured it out yet, this is a satirical news website. While some stuff may bear a strong resemblance to the truth, we assure you it is most decidedly bullshit.” As expected they cover humor for police and at their expense, such as this: [BREAKING: Entire Shift on Sick Leave after Gas Station Burrito Incident](https://bluenewsnetwork.com/breaking-entire-shift-on-sick-leave-after-gas-station-burrito-incident/). In general, this is a lighthearted satire website that touches the [edges of politics](https://bluenewsnetwork.com/ilhan-omar-says-police-shouldnt-exist-after-learning-some-cops-are-jewish/).
