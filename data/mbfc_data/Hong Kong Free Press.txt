Analysis / Bias
Background on Hong Kong’s Politics: Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under the
[“One Country, Two Systems”](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2019/06/one-country-two-systems-lots-of-problems.html) policy to ensure it kept its autonomy and distinct legal system. In recent years, concerns have arisen about Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong’s governance and the erosion of its freedoms, leading to a [new national security law (NSL)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838) in 2020. Currently, Hong Kong is split into the [ pro-democracy camp](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-protests/Hong-Kong-s-economy-splits-into-pro-and-anti-government-camps), seeking more democracy and human rights, and the pro-Beijing camp, which supports the policies and objectives of the central [Chinese government](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/).
HKFP advocates for democratic freedoms, human rights, and the rule of law in Hong Kong, aligning with Western liberal values. HKFP critically reports on the Hong Kong government and Beijing’s influence, especially concerning the National Security Law. For example, the article
[“HKFP Yum Cha: Democrat Emily Lau Recalls Early Morning Visit from Hong Kong national security police](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/12/23/hkfp-yum-cha-hong-kong-democrat-emily-lau-recalls-an-early-morning-visit-from-national-security-police/)” contains emotionally loaded language indicating a critical stance towards Hong Kong’s national security police.
Similarly,
[“Lawyer Michael Vidler reflects on 19 years of equal rights advocacy in Hong Kong, and his reasons for leaving”](https://hongkongfp.com/2022/06/02/lawyer-michael-vidler-reflects-on-19-years-of-equal-rights-advocacy-in-hong-kong-and-his-reasons-for-leaving/) criticizes the Beijing-drafted national security law and its effects on Hong Kong’s legal and social fabric. The articles convey concern and opposition to the law and Beijing’s influence. The article mentions increased surveillance and intimidation, including personal attacks from state-controlled media, as factors influencing Vidler’s decision to leave Hong Kong.
HKFP also supports LGBTQ rights, as seen in their coverage of equal rights issues, such as the article
[“Denial of equal rights for Hong Kong’s gay citizens dovetails with China’s human rights playbook”](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/12/17/denial-of-equal-rights-for-hong-kongs-gay-citizens-dovetails-with-chinas-human-rights-playbook/) discussing discrimination and inequality in the region.
Regarding sourcing, HKFP sources information from various outlets, including peer-reviewed academic journals like
[International Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/international-organization/), factually mixed sources like [The South China Morning Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-china-morning-post/#google_vignette) and The Guardian, and pro-Beijing media such as [tkww.hk](https://www.tkww.hk/a/202204/25/AP6266aa24e4b0a469025b3d7a.html) and republishes [AFP articles](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). Although they may occasionally rely on sources who have failed fact-checks, the Hong Kong Free Press has never failed a fact-check and is frequently used as a resource by fact-checkers on matters concerning Hong Kong.
