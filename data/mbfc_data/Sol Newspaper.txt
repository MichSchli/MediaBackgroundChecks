Analysis / Bias
Sol reports most news neutrally, as seen in the article about the resignation of the President of Volt “
[President of Volt Portugal resigns due to ideological disagreement.”](https://sol.sapo.pt/artigo/772081/presidente-do-volt-portugal-desfilia-se-por-discord-ncia-ideologica) However, some articles use emotionally loaded language, like [”Judicial activism corrodes the West.”](https://sol.sapo.pt/artigo/796226/ativismo-judicial-corroi-o-ocidente) The article criticizes the perceived politicization of the judiciary in various countries, including the US and the Roe Vs. Wade decision.
Abortion is a highly debated topic in American politics, with differing views on the legality and morality of the practice; the article critiques the politicization of the US judiciary, citing the Roe Vs. Wade decision as an example, and argues that the problem was corrected only after Donald Trump’s election. A quote from the article reads, “But it took almost half a century to correct the problem and only after the election of an anti-establishment president like Donald Trump.” Generally, Sol’s political views align with the Catholic Church’s, as shown in another article opposing abortion and referencing the Roe v. Wade case: “
[The issue of abortion and the case of Roe v. wade.”](https://sol.sapo.pt/artigo/772640/a-questao-do-aborto-e-o-caso-roe-v-wade)
Sol’s coverage of climate change takes a left-leaning, pro-science view, as seen in the article about climate change titled “
[Zero says climate emergency “doesn’t deserve crumbs” from EU.”](https://sol.sapo.pt/artigo/785567/zero-diz-que-emerg-ncia-climatica-nao-merece-as-migalhas-da-ue) The article reports on the environmental organization Zero’s criticism of the European Union’s climate policies, arguing that they do not go far enough in addressing the urgent issue of climate change. However, more stories favor the right overall.
Regarding sourcing, they rarely provide hyperlinks, but they have never failed a fact check either; therefore, Sol moderately favors the right editorially and reports news factually.
