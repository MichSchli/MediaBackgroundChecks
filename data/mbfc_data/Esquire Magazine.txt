Analysis / Bias
In review, Esquire publishes information and stories geared toward men. Staff writes content, and some stories are derived from other Hearst properties. When reporting political news, Esquire uses strong loaded language that usually favors the left, such as this:
[The Koch Money Was a Primary Vector for the Prion Disease That’s Infected the Republican Party](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a28798394/david-koch-dead-climate-denial-republican-politics/). This story is properly sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/).
Editorially, Esquire does not separate commentary articles from general news; however, virtually all reporting on former President Trump and his administration is negative. For example, these:
[The G7 Is Just Another Stage for a Presidential Sh*tshow](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a28815033/president-trump-g7-climate-amazon-nuke-hurricanes/) [Trump Emboldens Racist Terrorists. Then He Plays Sheriff on Twitter.](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a28601140/trump-el-paso-shooting-racism-twitter/) [Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump, and a Russian Oligarch Is Peak Sleazy Corruption](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a28580523/jeffrey-epstein-donald-trump-palm-beach-mansion-russian-oligarch/)
