History
[Founded in 2001](https://whois.domaintools.com/countercurrents.org), CounterCurrents.org is a news and opinion website based in India. According to their [about page](https://countercurrents.org/about/), the objective of Countercurrents.org “is to spread awareness about the climate change crisis and search for meaningful solutions. We believe that energy-intensive globalization should end, and it must be replaced by low energy, ecologically sustainable local economies.” [Read our profile on India’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/india-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Countercurrents.org provides news and opinions from a progressive left perspective endorsing environmentalism, human rights, and support for Palestine in the struggle with Israel. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[Private hospitals fleecing the people by overcharging for vaccines](https://countercurrents.org/2021/06/private-hospitals-fleecing-the-people-by-overcharging-for-vaccines/). This story is properly sourced, as are others on the website.
Editorially, Countercurrents.org aligns strongly with the progressive left. They also promote pro-science perspectives on
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and [Coronavirus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/). While they certainly align strongly with the more so-called radical left, they promote proper sourcing techniques and thus far are factual in reporting, though very one-sided.
Failed Fact Checks
- None found. However, they appeared on the
[IFCN unreliable news list](https://www.poynter.org/letter-from-the-editor/2019/letter-from-the-editor/), which was promptly retracted after [Poynter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poynter-institute/)was [called out](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/05/04/poynter-did-the-right-thing/)for poor research and oversight. Poynter makes mistakes, as they did with their assessment of MBFC in old articles. They have gotten better.
