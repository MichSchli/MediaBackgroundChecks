Analysis / Bias
In review, Deadline Hollywood typically produces original news content about the entertainment industry. Headlines are usually straightforward and low-biased such as this:
[ABC Buys Legal Drama ‘Reasonable Doubt’ Produced By Kerry Washington, Larry Wilmore & Shawn Holley](https://deadline.com/2019/10/abc-buys-legal-drama-reasonable-doubt-from-scandal-writer-kerry-washington-larry-wilmore-shawn-holley-1202772809/). Some headlines are slightly sensationalized regarding celebrities, but for the most part, information is sourced accurately, and the headlines describe the news story.
Editorially, Deadline Hollywood reports on politics as it relates to the entertainment industry. In other words, they offer minimal opinions. However, when covering former President Trump, they typically are negative and use loaded emotional language such as this:
[President Donald Trump Tweetstorm – The Saturday Edition](https://deadline.com/2019/10/president-donald-trump-tweetstorm-the-saturday-edition-45-1202769749/). In general, Deadline Hollywood reports factually and displays a left-leaning bias when covering politics.
