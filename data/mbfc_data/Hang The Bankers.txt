Analysis / Bias
In review, Hang the Bankers is primarily a conspiracy website with articles such as this:
[United States calls on Al-Qaeda to stage false flag attack in Syria.](https://hangthebankers.com/united-states-calls-al-qaeda-stage-false-flag-attack-syria/) They also frequently report on the [New World Order](http://hangthebankers.com/this-chart-shows-the-bilderberg-groups-connection-to-everything-in-the-world/) as well as [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). This source belongs in our [conspiracy category](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/), however, they do present with a [right wing bias](https://hangthebankers.com/clinton-global-initiative-shut-down/) in reporting, therefore we label them Questionable as they are not strictly a conspiracy website.
