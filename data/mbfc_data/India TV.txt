Analysis / Bias
In review, India TV publishes articles with emotionally loaded language and with a pro-Narendra Modi tone (Current Prime Minister and right-wing nationalist party
[BJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) leader) such as [“Beware of ‘Foreign Destructive Ideology’: PM Modi,”](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/beware-foreign-destructive-ideology-pm-modi-rajya-sabha-address-farmer-protest-683492) and [“PM Narendra Modi combines humor with sincerity in interactive session with India’s Tokyo-bound athletes.”](https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/other/pm-narendra-modi-combines-humour-with-sincerity-in-interactive-session-with-india-tokyo-olympics-bound-athletes-719043)
Although biased in favor of Modi, they also cover his critics, such as
[“’Arbitrary & discriminatory’: Sonia Gandhi writes to PM Modi over new vaccine policy.”](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/sonia-gandhi-letter-to-pm-narendra-modi-new-vaccine-policy-covid19-699636) Under the Lifestyle section, India TV sometimes promotes pseudoscience such as [“Vastu Tips: Add salt to water while cleaning the house to destroy negative energy.”](https://www.indiatvnews.com/lifestyle/vastu-vastu-tips-add-salt-to-water-while-cleaning-the-house-to-destroy-negative-energy-719398) There is [no evidence](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/believing-in-bad-vibes/) to support this claim. When it comes to sourcing, they hyperlink to themselves and utilize the [PTI](http://www.ptinews.com/aboutpti/aboutus.aspx) (The Press Trust of India Ltd.,) news agency and [IANS News Agency](https://www.ians.in/index.php?param=common/about_us) and their own news desk.
When covering world news about the USA, they tend to cover the Biden administration positively
[“India was there for us, and we will be there for them: Biden after talks with PM Modi.”](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/joe-biden-says-india-was-there-for-us-we-will-be-there-for-them-biden-pm-modi-conversation-700704) In general, they moderately favor the right and report news factually, however, they sometimes promote pseudoscience as evidenced above.
