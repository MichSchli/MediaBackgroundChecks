[anti-capitalism](https://novaramedia.com/2021/08/09/we-cant-dismantle-capitalism-without-antiracist-solidarity/), concern for [climate change](https://novaramedia.com/2021/08/12/are-any-politicians-actually-serious-about-climate-change/), and [racial-social equality](https://novaramedia.com/2021/04/01/define-divide-and-rule-the-race-report-shows-the-state-is-not-interested-in-racial-liberation/).
