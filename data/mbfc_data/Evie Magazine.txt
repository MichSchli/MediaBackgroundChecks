History
Founded in 2018 by Brittany Martinez and Gabriel Hugoboom, Evie Magazine is a conservative women’s magazine published online and once a year in print. According to their
[about page](https://www.eviemagazine.com/about), “Millions of women across America have been forgotten by the publishing world. They’re tired of having to go to trashy or politically biased sites and magazines just to get quality reads on health, beauty, and more. For years, these publications have focused on proving how women are great by showing how they can be just like men.”

Analysis / Bias
Evie Magazine publishes health, beauty, style, relationships, and career articles. They also have a section labeled “Culture,” which provides politically oriented news from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines feature emotional wording, such as
[The Shamelessly Shallow Guide On How To Be A Soft Girl](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/the-shamelessly-shallow-guide-on-how-to-be-a-soft-girl). The articles provided outside of the “Culture” category tend to be mostly non-political and focus on women’s health and beauty.
Under the Culture category, there is a radical difference in content. Most articles offer far-right viewpoints such as this
[J.K. Rowling Isn’t Backing Down On Defending Biological Women From Radical Transgender Ideology](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/j-k-rowling-isnt-backing-down-on-defending-biological-women-from-radical).
Evie Magazine holds extreme positions on abortion, such as claiming that
[abortion is never necessary](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/5-myths-about-abortion-that-need-to-be-debunked-in-the-wake-of-roe-v-wade), even if the woman needs an abortion to save her own life. According to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, abortions can be [medically necessary](https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2019/09/abortion-can-be-medically-necessary).
Evie Magazine has also published conspiracy theories such as this
[Bill Gates Is A Real Life Comic Book Villain Who Wants To Depopulate The World, So He’s Starting With The Most Vulnerable](https://web.archive.org/web/20220918154614/https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/bill-gates-real-life-comic-book-villain-who-wants-depopulate-world). There is [no evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8874471/) to suggest this.
Finally, Evie consistently promotes anti-vaccination pseudoscience, such as this
[Nearly Half Of Women Who Took Pfizer Covid Trial Vaccine Experienced A Miscarriage](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/nearly-half-of-women-who-took-pfizer-covid-trial-vaccine-experienced-a-miscarriage). Not only is this [false](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/08/scicheck-covid-19-vaccination-doesnt-increase-miscarriage-risk-contrary-to-naomi-wolfs-spurious-stat/), but the source [Naomi Wolf](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=naomi%20wolf) is also well-known for spreading scientific misinformation. In general, Evie Magazine is a far-right conservative source that publishes misinformation and makes false claims, especially regarding science.
