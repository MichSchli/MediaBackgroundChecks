Analysis / Bias
The Discern Report’s reporting has a right-leaning bias. For instance, an article titled
[“What Jill Biden’s Latest Covid-Positive Test Means for Pandemic Panic Theater 2.0”](https://discernreport.com/what-jill-bidens-latest-covid-positive-test-means-for-pandemic-panic-theater-2-0/) questions established scientific guidelines related to COVID-19 and suggests news about Jill Biden’s COVID-19 infection is part of a fearmongering campaign aimed at future lockdowns.
An article titled
[“Beef Company CEO: ‘The Climate Change Argument Against Cows Is Garbage, and We Will Not Comply,'”](https://discernreport.com/beef-company-ceo-the-climate-change-argument-against-cows-is-garbage-and-we-will-not-comply/) is sponsored content that presents the views of a beef company CEO on the debate surrounding beef production and climate change. However, the article lacks verifiable references and cites a source known to spread misinformation. Despite being sponsored content, upholding standards of factual accuracy, unbiased reporting, and ethical journalism is still crucial.
The article features Jason Nelson, CEO of freeze-dried food company Prepper All-Naturals, who challenges the argument that alternative protein sources should replace real beef due to the impact of cattle on climate change. Nelson contends that this narrative is based on false claims and is being used to control the food supply and people. The article mentions studies that suggest lab-grown meat is more harmful to the environment than real beef but fails to provide sources for these claims. Further, the article relies heavily on
[Dr. Joseph Mercola](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/NYT-Presents/joseph-mercola-coronavirus-misinformation.html), a known spreader of [misinformation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/), as a primary source.
Regarding sources, they also aggregate content from the Questionable and Very Low Factual
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) website. In general, the Discern Report demonstrates far-right biases and is not always factual.
Failed Fact Checks
[DNA in COVID mRNA shots “may have the ability to alter the human genome”; “SV40 has been linked to cancer in humans”; “Regulatory Agencies Knew There Was a Contamination Problem”](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/claim-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-dna-contaminants-study-unknown-provenance-no-evidence-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-alter-dna-people/)– Inaccurate [“Since the COVID jabs were rolled out, at least 1.1 million Americans have ‘died suddenly.’”](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/dec/09/instagram-posts/no-11-million-americans-did-not-die-suddenly-becau/)– False
Overall, The Discern Report leans far right, favoring conservative topics and viewpoints while criticizing the left. Due to its one-sided reporting, promotion of antivaccine propaganda, election conspiracy, and lack of evidence for some claims, its credibility and factual accuracy are questionable. (M.
