Analysis / Bias
Mutembei TV publishes news and videos related to Kenyan politics, society, and events. The language used in headlines and articles is sensational such as
[“MP Expelled from Parliament for Wearing Turban,”](https://mutembeitv.com/2023/06/29/mp-expelled-from-parliament-for-wearing-turban/) which can evoke strong emotional responses. Additionally, the lack of external sources in their reporting makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the information, potentially leading to a one-sided presentation of events.
Another sensational story,
[A Bizarre Twist: Ndaragu Village in Shock as Sick Woman Vomits Dead Rat](https://mutembeitv.com/2023/06/29/a-bizarre-twist-ndaragu-village-in-shock-as-sick-woman-vomits-dead-rat/), does not provide any links or evidence to support the claim. The purpose of this story appears to be to illicit clicks (clickbait) through its shocking headline.
A political article titled
[“Musyoka’s Mwingi Cottages Resort: A Political Leader’s Multi-Million-Dollar Venture”](https://mutembeitv.com/2023/06/29/kalonzo-musyokas-mwingi-cottages-resort-a-political-leaders-multi-million-dollar-venture/#) demonstrates bias, potentially aiming to critique a center-left politician [Kalonzo Musyoka](https://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/index.php?Stephen-Kalonza-Musyoka) by highlighting his ownership of a luxury resort. On the other hand, Mutembei TV demonstrates a positive tone towards conservative politicians, such as in the article [“Uhuru Kenyatta Makes Strategic Appointments as His Term Ends.”](https://mutembeitv.com/2022/08/07/uhuru-kenyatta-makes-strategic-appointments-as-his-term-ends/) In general, Mutembei holds a right-leaning editorial bias while often promoting news stories and claims without evidence.
