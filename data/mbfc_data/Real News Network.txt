Analysis / Bias
In review, The Real News covers information via video and written reports with a left-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines contain minimal to moderately loaded wording:
[Climate Activists Protest Trump California Public Lands Fracking Plan.](https://therealnews.com/columns/climate-activists-protest-trump-california-public-lands-fracking-plan) This story is well-sourced to [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), Capitol Weekly, and the [Associated Press,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) among others. There is a link to a TRNN video: [Activists Push Back Against Conservative Threat to Safe and Legal Abortion](https://therealnews.com/stories/activists-push-back-against-conservative-threat-to-safe-and-legal-abortion) in another story.
Editorially, TRNN supports more progressive candidates such as this:
[The DCCC’s Anti-Progressive Policy Might Be Backfiring](https://therealnews.com/stories/the-dcccs-anti-progressive-policy-might-be-backfiring-2-2). TRNN also frequently conducts interviews with notable people such as Noam Chomsky. The Real News Network generally publishes news that leans left based on story selection and with proper sourcing.
