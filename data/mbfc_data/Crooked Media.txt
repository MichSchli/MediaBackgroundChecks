Analysis / Bias
Crooked publishes articles that utilize strong loaded words such as: “
[DONALD TRUMP’S OBSTRUCTION DEFENSE IS COLLAPSING](https://crooked.com/article/donald-trump-obstruction-defense-collapse/),” however they source to credible news media such as [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), and the President’s tweets. Story selection always favors the left with stories such as this [DEMOCRATS MUST KEEP FIGHTING TRUMP’S BAILOUTS](https://crooked.com/articles/democrats-trump-bailouts/) and frequently denigrate President Trump: [TRUMP RAMPS UP RACIST CORONAVIRUS SCAPEGOATING](https://crooked.com/articles/trump-coronavirus-scapegoating/). Again, these articles are appropriately sourced.
Crooked also has a link to their other website,
[Vote Save America](https://votesaveamerica.com/), which encourages people to vote and provides information about the Presidential candidates. There is a very strong left-leaning editorial bias as they portray [Trump](https://votesaveamerica.com/candidate/donald-trump/) negatively with statements such as his priorities “Increase health care costs and repeal the Affordable Care Act.” Further, when you hover the mouse over his picture, a poop emoji appears. When you hover over [Joe Biden](https://votesaveamerica.com/candidate/joe-biden/), it displays a smiley face emoji. It lists his top priority as “Protect the ACA and offer a Medicare public option to diversify health care choices.” Crooked generally reports news factually; however, there is a very strong one-sided left bias that can be misleading due to a lack of context.
