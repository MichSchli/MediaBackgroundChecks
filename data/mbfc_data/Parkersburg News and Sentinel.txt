Analysis / Bias
In review, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel covers local news through reporters with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Power outages strike Mid-Ohio Valley late Thursday, early Friday](https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2021/03/power-outages-strike-mid-ohio-valley-late-thursday-early-friday/).

Editorially, they have a history of endorsing more Republican candidates, for example, the endorsed Republican John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. A review of op-eds slightly favors the right such as this
[Op-ed: Hard choices to make](https://www.newsandsentinel.com/opinion/local-columns/2021/03/op-ed-hard-choices-to-make/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
