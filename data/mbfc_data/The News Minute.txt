Analysis / Bias
The News Minute offers a mix of news, opinion, and analysis articles. In the article titled
[“Conspiracy to silence Rahul Gandhi after he questioned Modi and Adani: KC Venugopal](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/conspiracy-silence-rahul-gandhi-after-he-questioned-modi-and-adani-kc-venugopal-175053),” the narrative predominantly presents the perspectives of Congress leaders regarding Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification from the Lok Sabha. The narrative leans towards the left-leaning Congress party’s perspective, suggesting a bias favoring the Congress party’s viewpoint.
Transitioning to social issues, the article
[“Cutting the phallus and destroying binaries: Transgender activist Kalki’s battle through art”](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/cutting-phallus-and-destroying-binaries-transgender-activist-kalkis-battle-through-art-44694) focuses on the life, struggles, and achievements of Kalki Subramaniam, a transgender activist. The narrative is empathetic and leans towards a progressive stance, emphasizing the importance of acceptance, understanding, and rights for the transgender community.
Furthermore, in the article
[“Why Narendra Modi Won: Indians have stopped living in the Past, and he is about the Future](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-narendra-modi-won-indians-have-stopped-living-past-and-he-about-future-58567),” the platform presents a positive perspective on the right-leaning Narendra Modi’s leadership and vision for India, suggesting a favorable bias towards Narendra Modi.
Regarding sourcing, The News Minute’s articles predominantly rely on statements from key figures or stakeholders for sourcing. While they provide detailed accounts with direct quotes, external hyperlinks for verification are infrequent. For example,
[the article](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kochi-s-maharajas-college-suspends-6-students-insulting-visually-impaired-prof-181133) about the suspension of students at Maharaja’s College in Ernakulam references a report from the [Times of India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-india/) but doesn’t offer a direct link. Only in some contexts, in a different article, did they hyperlink to [The Hindu.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hindu/) This approach can challenge readers’ ability to validate the information.
Considering the articles, The News Minute leans left-center, emphasizing progressive values, especially in articles related to social issues like transgender rights. However, the platform also provides a balanced view on political matters, but individual articles may lean in a particular direction based on the topic.
