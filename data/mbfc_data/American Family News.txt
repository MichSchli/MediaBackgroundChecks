History
[Founded in 2007](http://whois.domaintools.com/onenewsnow.com), American Family News (formerly OneNewsNow) is a news and opinion website with an extreme Christian Right bias. According to their [about page](https://onenewsnow.com/general/about), “Whether it’s a story about prayer in public schools, workplace restrictions on Christians, or battles for biblical truth within our denominations, the American Family News Network (AFN) is here to tell you what the newsmakers are saying.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The
[American Family Association (AFA)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-family-association/) owns and operates American Family News, which is a fundamentalist Protestant 501(c)(3) organization based in the United States. They primarily oppose LGBT rights and expression, pornography, and abortion. The AFA has been listed as a [hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-family-association) by the [Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) as of November 2010 for the “propagation of known falsehoods” and the use of “demonizing propaganda” against LGBT people. The website is funded through the AFA, which is in turn funded through donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, American Family News publishes news stories that favor the right and denigrate the left, often using loaded emotional headlines such as this:
[Race quotas a danger to critical thought](https://afn.net/legal-courts/2021/10/22/race-quotas-a-danger-to-critical-thought/). The website also publishes news from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) that relates to their political ideology.
Editorially, American Family News does not support the
[consensus of science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on [climate change](https://onenewsnow.com/science-tech/2018/09/22/30-yrs-later-global-warming-still-hasnt-sunk-maldives) or [evolution](https://onenewsnow.com/science-tech/2018/05/31/when-your-dna-research-pokes-holes-in-darwin). They also frequently promote fear of socialism, such as [The Marxist move to cancel Jefferson](https://afn.net/opinion/guest-commentary/2021/10/21/the-marxist-move-to-cancel-jefferson/). The website further promotes Democratic election fraud [Poll: Voters know fraud is part of Democrats’ agenda](https://afn.net/politics-govt/2021/10/18/poll-voters-know-fraud-is-part-of-democrats-agenda/) and questionable beliefs regarding race and LGBTQ. In general, the website’s content strongly supports a conservative Christian perspective and often promotes false or misleading information, especially when it relates to science.
