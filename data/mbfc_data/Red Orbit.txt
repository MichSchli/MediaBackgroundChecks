Analysis / Bias
In review, RedOrbit publishes news related to space, science, tech, and health. Most stories are summaries that are not always sourced, but frequently use minimally loaded words such as this
[Washington State Uses Starlink to Assist With Combating Wildfires](https://www.redorbit.com/washington-state-uses-starlink-to-assist-with-combating-wildfires/). For the most part, many stories are not sourced properly. When it comes to reporting on Science, which is their genre, they generally are pro-science and align with the consensus such as this, [GMOs are safe to consume, study says](https://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1113414148/report-says-gmos-are-safe-051816/). In general, the content on RedOrbit is pro-science and appears factual, however, there is such a lack of transparency and poor sourcing that we rate this source questionable. If this source upgraded their transparency they could attain a pro-science designation.
