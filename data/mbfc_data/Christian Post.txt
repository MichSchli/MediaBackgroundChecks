Analysis / Bias
In review, The Christian Post covers news via reporters on topics of interest to Christians. Headlines are a mix of minimally loaded language with news headlines and some with strong emotionally loaded words on opinion pieces such as this:
[Beto O’Rourke, climate change, and the end of the world.](https://www.christianpost.com/voice/beto-orourke-climate-change-and-the-end-of-the-world.html) This misleading headline implies that Beto O’Rourke is claiming the end of the world due to climate change. The content of the article does not reflect this. Rather, it quotes O’Rourke, who said we have 12 years to take serious action on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) based on scientific consensus. O’Rourke never mentions the end of the world. However, the author does, by quoting the Book of Revelations. This article also sources the questionable [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), which has failed fact-checks by IFCN fact-checkers. In general, most opinion pieces lean right but not too far right to be considered extreme.
There is a strong Christian bias in story selection when reporting straight news, but the information is generally sourced properly to credible media outlets and organizations.
