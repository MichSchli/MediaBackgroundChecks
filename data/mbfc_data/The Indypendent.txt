Analysis / Bias
In review, The Indypendent is a progressive print newspaper and website based in New York City. The Indypendent utilizes moderately loaded words in headlines such as this:
[New York is Set to Cash In On Cannabis. But Who Will Get the Green?](https://indypendent.org/2019/02/new-york-is-set-to-cash-in-on-cannabis-but-who-will-get-the-green/) Although this story is not sourced via hyperlinks, it does provide proper quotations to those interviewed in the article. Story selection usually favors the left with many stories about equal rights, social justice, and [democratic socialism](https://indypendent.org/2018/12/gearing-up-for-a-green-new-deal/).
In general, this is a progressive paper that factually sources content to support their opinions.
