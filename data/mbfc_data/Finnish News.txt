Analysis / Bias
In their own words, they describe their
[view](https://www.finnishnews.fi/finnishnews/) as “We have a strong Nordic viewpoint – one which respects democracy, the rule of law, sustainable and transparent policies.”
In review, when covering national news, they use moderately loaded language in their headlines, such as
[“This Week in Politics – True Finns Are Not True.”](https://www.finnishnews.fi/business-finance/this-week-in-politics-true-finns-are-not-true/) In the body of this article, they fact-check the [True Finns Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finns_Party) (nationalistic populist right-wing party of Finland) and strongly criticize them with this quote “His shadow budget is an interesting mix of nationalistic fanciful thinking that would never happen if they got elected into government, but it is colorful enough to win over bigoted voters.”
When covering international news about the UK, they use emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“Boris is Not Churchill & Not Great for UK,](https://www.finnishnews.fi/business-finance/boris-is-no-churchill-not-great-for-uk/) and when covering the USA, they have a strong anti-Trump tone such as this: “ [Trump was Extremely Rude to the Finnish President.](https://www.finnishnews.fi/business-finance/trump-was-extremely-rude-to-the-finnish-president/)“ Finally, when it comes to sourcing, they do not provide hyperlinks to the sources they reference, such as the [New York Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) As a web-only publication, hyperlinks are expected to be provided for the reader to check the author’s claims.
