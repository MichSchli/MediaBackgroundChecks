History
[Founded in 1999](http://whois.domaintools.com/rense.com), Rense.com is a website created for the Jeff Rense Radio program, formerly on satellite radio. The radio program and website promote pseudoscience and extreme right-wing conspiracy theories.
Rense’s writing and website have been deemed pro-Nazi and antisemitic by the
[Anti-Defamation League](https://www.adl.org/news/article/rense-web-site-promotes-anti-semitic-view) and the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/04/26/jeff-rense-his-own-words).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Rense.com primarily curates and aggregates news from other sources that are often conspiratorial, covering topics such as 9-11 as an inside job, UFOs,
[Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), and the paranormal. Rense also frequently reports negatively on Muslims and people of African descent with articles such as this [Knife Crime By Muslim And Black African Invaders
In England And Wales, Rockets To Record Highs In 2019 And The True Picture Is Probably Even Worse](https://www.rt.com/uk/486627-knife-crime-record-high-2019/). This article is curated from the Russian propaganda source [RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/). However, the title of RT’s article does not refer to immigrants as “Invaders,” which is a highly emotional negative term.
When it comes to pseudoscience, they frequently publish
[David Icke](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/david-icke/), who believes there is a “The Reptilian Illuminati” and promotes [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). Further, they do not support the consensus of science regarding [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/): [Greta Thunberg’s Climate Change Hoax Damaging America’s Children](https://rense.com/general96/greta-thunbergs-climate-change-hoax-damaging-americas-children.php). In general, Rense is a crackpot far-right conspiracy and pseudoscience website that is less credible than [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/).
