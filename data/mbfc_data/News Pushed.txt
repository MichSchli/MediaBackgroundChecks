History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/newspushed.com), News Pushed is a conservative news and opinion website based in the United Kingdom. According to their [about page](https://newspushed.com/about/), “News Pushed prides itself on its goal of becoming the world’s leading independent news publication, free from the agenda of the corporate mainstream media.” They further state, “News Pushed focuses on topics that are important to Heartland Americans and that they advocate for broadly conservative positions on most issues, including abortion, national defense, small government, tax policy, and individual freedom.”
Although Adam Morgan publishes all articles, the website lacks transparency as it does not disclose ownership. Further, they provide a mailing address on their contact page that links to a

Analysis / Bias
In review, News Pushed generally summarizes news stories from other sources and inserts conservative commentary. Articles and headlines frequently use loaded emotional wording such as this
[Beijing Biden on His Quest to Destroy the Nation, ALREADY Costing Americans Jobs](https://newspushed.com/beijing-biden-on-his-quest-to-destroy-the-nation-already-costing-americans-jobs/), and this [Trump Finally Drops the Sledgehammer and its Beautiful](https://newspushed.com/trump-finally-drops-the-sledgehammer-and-its-beautiful-2/). Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left. When it comes to sourcing, they use credible sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Stars and Stripes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stars-and-stripes/); however, some articles are sourced to poor outlets that frequently fail checks such as [National Pulse](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-national-pulse/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Project Veritas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-veritas/), and [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/).
In 2020, News Pushed promoted misinformation regarding Covid-19 such as this
[A Danish Clinical Study About Masks Is Being Suppressed Because Of The Results](https://newspushed.com/a-danish-clinical-study-about-masks-is-being-suppressed-because-of-the-results/). A quote from the article reads, “If it shows they don’t work, we need to know so that we can try other solutions. If it shows they’re harmful, we need to know, SO WE DON’T TELL PEOPLE TO WEAR THEM.”
The study did not say
[masks don’t work](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) and never mentioned that they are harmful. The study concluded that masks did not protect the wearer as effectively as thought. One of the [researchers stated](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/07/viral-image/no-danish-study-didnt-prove-wearing-masks-ineffect/) that the “study should not be used to discourage mask-wearing. Even a small degree of protection is worth using the face masks because you are protecting yourself against a potentially life-threatening disease.”
During and after the 2020 Presidential election, News Pushed also promoted election fraud propaganda and conspiracy theories such as this
[Cover-Up! Michigan Secretary Of State Is Trying To Delete Evidence After Dominion Report Shows’ Systemic Fraud’](https://newspushed.com/cover-up-michigan-secretary-of-state-is-trying-to-delete-evidence-after-dominion-report-shows-systemic-fraud/). This report is [false](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/audit-in-michigan-county-refutes-dominion-conspiracy-theory/). In another story, [Election, Fraud Bombshell Dropped In Nevada: “130,000 Illegal Ballots Were Cast, 42,000 People Potentially Voted Twice”](https://newspushed.com/election-fraud-bombshell-dropped-in-nevada-130000-illegal-ballots-were-cast-42000-people-potentially-voted-twice/), they also published [false information](https://factcheck.afp.com/claims-nevada-voter-fraud-rejected-states-top-court). In general, News Pushed publishes news that is not always factual and holds a far-right editorial bias.
