History
Founded in 2011 by conservative commentator Kevin Jackson, The Blacksphere is a politically conservative website that provides a link for Kevin Jackson’s radio show and publishes news. According to their
[about page](https://theblacksphere.net/about/about-kevin-jackson/) Jackson “writes a regular blog, and is a syndicated writer for [TakiMag.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/takis-magazine/). He also contributes to [Breitbart’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) Big Government, [Human Events](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-events/), and [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/). His work has been featured in [Townhall.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), and other national political journals and websites.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, BlackSphere publishes original articles by Jackson that are supportive of former President Trump and denigrates liberals. Many articles link to his radio show. Most articles and headlines feature highly loaded emotional wording that favors the right, such as this
[White House’s SCATHING Rebuke of NY Gov Cuomo](https://theblacksphere.net/2020/09/white-houses-scathing-rebuke-of-ny-gov-cuomo/). This story is sourced from tweets and the [New York Daily News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-daily-news/).
Another example of denigration of the left is this story
[Democrats PANIC: Leftist Icons Call Latest Strategy Pure Madness](https://theblacksphere.net/2020/09/democrats-panic-strategy-pure-madness/). This story is again sourced from social media and the non-credible [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/). Further, the story features an unflattering photo of Nancy Pelosi, which is typical of this website. Finally, throughout the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://theblacksphere.net/?s=covid) of 2020-2023, this source has routinely published misleading information, and during the election of 2020, they have also published misinformation (see fact checks below). In general, all stories favor the far-right and Donald Trump while denigrating liberals.
