Analysis / Bias
The foundation promotes
[theistic evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution), which regards religious teachings about god as compatible with modern scientific understanding of biological evolution. Theistic evolution is not a scientific theory but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views. In general, Biologos does support the theory of evolution, which would classify this website as pro-science. However, they ascribe evolution to the hand and workings of God, which is not known or provable.
