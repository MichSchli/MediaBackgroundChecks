Analysis / Bias
In review, Foreign Affairs covers political, economic, and social issues worldwide.
[Encyclopedia Britannica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/encyclopedia-britannica/) [describes them](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Foreign-Affairs-journal) as “one of the world’s most prestigious periodicals of its kind.” Many articles are long-form analyses with minimal use of loaded language: [What a War With Iran Would Look Like](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-06-04/what-war-iran-would-look). This story is properly sourced to credible outlets such as the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and [Military Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-times/). Editorially, Foreign Affairs does not favor President Trump’s foreign policy: [American Foreign Policy Adrift](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-06-05/american-foreign-policy-adrift). Further, they also tend to have right-leaning views regarding [Globalization](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-06-11/globalizations-wrong-turn) as well as [free-market economics](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1948-04-01/case-free-market).
In general, information is presented with balance and with minimal use of emotional language.
