Funded by / Ownership
The National Post is owned by
[Postmedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a significant equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a
[downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

[The Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) and world news from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Toronto news comes from local journalists, and politics comes from various sources that lean right. Editorially, Post Media primarily supports the consensus of science on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but does present doubts. In general, National Post has a [slight right lean](https://nationalpost.com/?s=trump) through the support of former President Trump. Finally, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 60% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/canada) and 15% do not, ranking them #7 in trust among the major English language Canadian news providers.
