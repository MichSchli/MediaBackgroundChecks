History
The Financial Post was an
[English Canadian business newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Post), which was published from 1907 to 1998. In 1998, the publication was folded into the new [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/). However, the name Financial Post has been retained as the banner for that paper’s business section and lives on in the Post’s monthly business magazine, Financial Post Business. The Financial Post is edited by the National Post.

Funded by / Ownership
The Financial Post is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a significant equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a
[downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

Analysis / Bias
The Financial Post is part of the National Post newspaper and website, serving as their business section. The website covers financial news such as Markets, Finance, and politics related to the economy. Headlines and articles typically do not use loaded emotional language like
[Hockey brand CCM’s plan to grind it out in uncertain economic times](https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/hockey-brand-ccms-plan-to-grind-it-out-in-uncertain-economic-times). This story is appropriately sourced, although many are sourced back to the National Post. The FP also republishes articles from newswires such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/).
Editorially, The Financial Post supports a market-based economy with limited regulation such as this:
[Craig Alexander: Canada’s messy regulatory environment is holding back our economic prosperity](https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/craig-alexander-canadas-messy-regulatory-environment-is-holding-back-our-economic-prosperity). They have also published information that is not pro-Science (see below). The Financial Post reports news mostly factual with a right-center bias through story selection and editorial bias.
