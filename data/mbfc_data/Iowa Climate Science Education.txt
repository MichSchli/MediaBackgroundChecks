History
According to their
[about page](https://iowaclimate.org/about/), Iowa Climate Science Education states: “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), created to find and disseminate research finding a human impact on global climate, is not a credible source. It is agenda-driven, a political rather than scientific body, and some allege it is corrupt. Finally, climate scientists, like all humans, can be biased. Origins of bias include careerism, grant-seeking, political views, and confirmation bias.
Like most questionable sources, there isn’t any contact information or names associated with the website. A

Funded by / Ownership
Iowa Climate Science Education does not disclose ownership. Funding is also unknown as there does not appear to be any advertising. Somebody is paying the bills, but we do not know who it is. Red flag.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Iowa Climate Science Education is a human-influenced
[climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) website that utilizes very poor sources to prove that humans have minimal impact on climate change. For example, in this article: [Doom Arrives For Arctic Alarmists](https://iowaclimate.org/2018/07/27/doom-arrives-for-arctic-alarmists-2/), they source the [Deplorable Science Blog](https://realclimatescience.com/2018/07/doom-arrives-for-arctic-alarmists-2/), which is not a peer-reviewed publication (in case you were wondering). In [another article](https://iowaclimate.org/2018/07/30/betting-on-a-catastrophically-cooling-world/), they source a website called [Ice Age Now](https://www.iceagenow.info/), which purports to show the earth is cooling. This is not the consensus of science.
