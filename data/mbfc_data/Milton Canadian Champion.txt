In review, the Milton Canadian Champion uses low biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Town of Milton finalizing short-term rental regulations](https://www.thestar.com/local-milton/news/2022/06/13/town-of-milton-finalizing-short-term-rental-regulations.html). The national news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
