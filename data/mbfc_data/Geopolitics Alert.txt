History
[Founded in 2016](http://whois.domaintools.com/geopoliticsalert.com), Geopolitics Alert is a news website that describes itself as an “independent and anti-intervention world news” website. According to their [about page](https://geopoliticsalert.com/about), “Randi Nord and Jim Carey launched Geopolitics Alert shortly after Russia increased support for the Syrian government in 2015 and the Obama regime was expanding U.S. military involvement worldwide. We knew U.S. imperialism would start growing even more rapidly than it had for the past few decades — and under Trump, that’s exactly what’s happened.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Geopolitics Alert publishes news and opinions related to USA conflicts worldwide from a non-interventionist perspective. Geopolitics Alert uses occasional moderate loaded words that favor the left, such as: “
[There’s a great deal to be said about Donald Trump’s pardon for criminal racist Joe Arpaio.](http://geopoliticsalert.com/trump-joe-arpaio-promoted-media)” Another example is this [2019: A Disastrous Year for Trump’s Foreign Policy](https://geopoliticsalert.com/donald-trump-foreign-policy). For the most part, Geopolitics Alert does not produce original news content but rather republishes or summarizes stories from other sources such as [Telesur](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/telesur/), the questionable [Tehran Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tehran-times/), and [Tasnim News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tasnim-news-agency/).
Geopolitics alert is sometimes very well sourced to credible media such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [FAIR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/), and [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/); however, as seen above, they also use poor questionable sources as well, which hurts their credibility. From an editorial standpoint, most stories favor left/libertarian positions concerning the use of the military, especially regarding the USA.
