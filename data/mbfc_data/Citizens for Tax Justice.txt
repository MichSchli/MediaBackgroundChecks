History

CTJ’s work focuses primarily on federal tax policy. CTJ is generally considered to be a left-leaning organization. Still, its research has also been cited by Republican politicians and right-wing tax reform organizations when favorable to their policies. According to their [about page](https://ctj.org/about/), the goal of CTJ is to “ensure working people have a voice in the development of our nation’s tax policies. Against the armies of special interest lobbyists for corporations and the wealthy.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Citizens for Tax Justice advocates for the
[left-leaning position](https://ctj.org/donate/) of “progressive tax policy and ensure federal, state and local taxes reflect the will of the people, not the people in power.” The website does not really publish news but does produce stories that highlight income inequality, such as this [CEO to Worker Pay Ratio](https://ctj.org/ceo-to-worker-pay-ratio/).
Generally, this is a fiscal left-leaning advocacy group that reports factually but lacks financial disclosure.
