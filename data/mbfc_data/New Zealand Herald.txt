Analysis / Bias
In review, NZ Herald has a right-center bias in word choices in their opinion pieces and is critical of the current labor government, such as: “
[Political Roundup: Lifting the lid on lobbying in politics”](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12007466) and they use emotional language in their headlines such as [“Who needs friends like Labour’s coalition partners.”](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12018200) However, their editorials have a more neutral tone regarding NZ Politics, such as: [“Simon Bridges is National’s answer to Jacinda Ardern”](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12002964) (National is the opposition party to Labor and they are considered Center-Right). Although some of their articles are sourced through quotes and some use national sources that are not known to us, such as thespinoff.co., in their [world](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12019730) news they utilize credible sources such as the [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)
When it comes to US politics, they have left-leaning word choices, such as
[in this article,](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12014405) regarding Barack Obama’s visit to New Zealand on 18 March 2018 “Obama represents the dignity of the high office he won, the first African-American elected to it, and the respect it ought to command.” And [here](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12008835) they criticize Trump’s Trade policy “A trade war would hurt the US as well as the world.”
