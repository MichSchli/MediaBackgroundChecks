Analysis / Bias
The website specializes in investigative journalism, focusing on technology and societal issues. The articles and titles generally use emotionally loaded language and strong wording. For example, an article titled
[“White Supremacists Are Hijacking City Council Meetings All Over America”](https://www.404media.co/white-supremacists-dominate-san-diego-city-council-meeting/) uses emotionally loaded terms like “White Supremacists,” “Hijacking,” and “white f*cking power.” It presents facts about hate speech and extremism in local government by citing reputable sources such as [KFMB – San Diego News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kfmb-san-diego-news-bias/), [Vice Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vice-news/), [NBCsandiego](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), [KXTV – Sacramento News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kxtv-sacramento-news-bias/), and [Bangor Daily News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bangor-daily-news/).
Another article,
[“I Joined an Exclusive Club of YouTube Porn Hunters.”](https://www.404media.co/inside-the-secretive-world-of-youtube-porn/) discusses how people find explicit content on YouTube and describes their methods. While offering some investigative insights, it leans more towards sensationalism, focusing on shock value rather than critically analyzing YouTube’s moderation policies. The title uses sensational and provocative wording to attract attention and generate controversy.
Similarly, the body of the article uses emotionally loaded language. Terms like “Exclusive Club” and “YouTube Porn Hunters” are used to spark interest and highlight the controversial nature of the content. Phrases such as “feeding trash content to kids” and “awful shit” offer strong criticism of YouTube’s moderation policies. Additional terms like “exclusive Discord channel” and “hardcore porn” further sensationalize the subject. The article cites sources such as Reddit and YouTube. In general, 404 Media is left-leaning and mostly factual based on the sensational nature of its stories.
