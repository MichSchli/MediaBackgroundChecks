Analysis / Bias
In review (not podcasts), The Daily Centrist primarily reports political news with the use of moderately loaded headlines such as this:
[WHATABOUTISM FROM ANTI-TRUMP FORCES EXTEND SCANDAL-PLAGUED VA DEMS A LIFELINE](https://thedailycentrist.com/2019/02/08/whataboutism-from-anti-trump-forces-extend-scandal-plagued-va-dems-a-lifeline/#). While this is clearly an opinion piece, it is not labeled as such, which may create confusion. Further, there is zero sourcing to support the reasonable and balanced claims. In another article, [FINALLY-THE MYSTERIOUS TRUTH ABOUT MEDICARE FOR ALL](https://thedailycentrist.com/2019/02/04/finally-the-mysterious-truth-about-medicare-for-all/), there is the use of proper sourcing to credible sources such as the [Mercatus Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercatus-center/) and the article presents both sides.
In general, most stories on this website are opinion pieces and they generally cover both sides of the story, however sourcing to support claims is mixed.
