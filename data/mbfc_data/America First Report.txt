Analysis / Bias
The article
[“Details of the Amish Farmer Story Prove the FDA and USDA Should Be Dissolved Completely”](https://americafirstreport.com/details-of-the-amish-farmer-story-prove-the-fda-and-usda-should-be-dissolved-completely/) discusses the seizure of an Amish farmer’s cattle and advocates for the dissolution of the FDA and USDA. It mentions “cow share” as a community practice for obtaining milk or meat. While the practice itself is not inherently problematic, the article’s portrayal of it as a solution to “food tyranny” is not substantiated with evidence.
First, the article uses strong, emotionally loaded language such as “authoritarian Biden-Harris regime,” “food tyranny,” and “terrorist organizations” to describe the FDA and USDA. This language indicates a strong bias and undermines the article’s objectivity. Next, it makes sweeping claims about the FDA and USDA, calling them “terrorist organizations” and saying they should be “completely dissolved.” However, it does not provide sufficient evidence or context to support these claims.
The article cites a Twitter user named “Inversionism.” as its source. Finally, promotional codes and sponsorships within the article suggest potential commercial motives, which might influence the content’s objectivity.
America First Report also republishes content from the
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/#google_vignette) News Foundation. For example: [“Biden’s Support Is Crumbling Among Nonwhite Voters”](https://americafirstreport.com/bidens-support-is-crumbling-among-nonwhite-voters/) discusses the decline in support for [Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) among nonwhite voters. The site also supports [Former President Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). It promotes stolen election conspiracy theories such as [“Elections Were Stolen: Do NOT Let Them Gaslight You Into Thinking Otherwise,”](https://americafirstreport.com/elections-were-stolen-do-not-let-them-gaslight-you-into-thinking-otherwise/) citing factually questionable sources like [Life News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-news/)
The last article,
[“We Appear to Be Entering Stage Five of the Covid ‘Vaccine’ Con Job,”](https://americafirstreport.com/we-appear-to-be-entering-stage-five-of-the-covid-vaccine-con-job/) promotes vaccine skepticism by suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccination campaign is a “con job.” It implies that the vaccines are part of a larger agenda for “depopulation and control.” The article uses strong language and speculative claims about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines.
Failed Fact Checks
- America First Report has not yet failed a fact-check; however,
[NoQ Report (JD Rucker) has a poor track record with fact-checkers.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/noq-report/)
Overall, America First Report leans far right, favoring conservative topics and viewpoints while criticizing the left. Due to its one-sided reporting, promotion of antivaccine propaganda, election conspiracy, and lack of evidence for some claims, its credibility and factual accuracy are questionable. (M.
