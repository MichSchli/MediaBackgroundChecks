Analysis / Bias
In review, the Central Florida Post covers Florida and national politics from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded language, such as
[ “Democrat Failed Qualifying & Lied About Degrees, Orlando Sentinel Knew About It.”](https://centralfloridapost.com/2022/11/03/democrat-failed-qualifying-lied-about-degrees-orlando-sentinel-knew-about-it/) This story relies on reasonable sources such as the Jacksonville Daily Record, [The Guardian, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/)and blogs such as pgcpsmess.com. However, in [other stories](https://centralfloridapost.com/2022/08/31/groomer-activist-suing-desantis-lies-on-9-11-phone-call/), we have found they rely on Questionable sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which routinely fails fact checks.
Editorially, Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left, such as
[“Allie Braswell: Wokeness Pioneer, Cop-Hater, Potential Military Disability Abuser?”](https://centralfloridapost.com/2022/10/20/allie-braswell-wokeness-pioneer-cop-hater-potential-military-disability-abuser/) And [“FL Residents Roger Stone & Jacob Engels Appear In New Film About Media Propaganda Alongside Alex Jones.”](https://centralfloridapost.com/2020/02/26/fl-residents-roger-stone-jacob-engels-appear-in-new-film-about-media-propaganda-alongside-alex-jones/) Finally, the Central Florida Post has promoted debunked conspiracy theories such as the [Seth Rich conspiracy](https://web.archive.org/web/20210401163522/https://www.centralfloridapost.com/2017/05/31/fight-back-efforts-to-silence-alex-jones-backfire/) and unfounded [election fraud claims](https://web.archive.org/web/20220603183844/https://centralfloridapost.com/2021/10/18/dan-webster-balks-at-2020-election-fraud-during-gop-dinner/) relying on the [debunked 2000 Mules video](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2022/05/fact-check-2000-mules-does-not-prove-2020-election-was-stolen-documentary-contains-lots-of-holes-assumptions.html) by Dinesh D’Souza. In general, the Central Florida Post is a far-right biased imposter website that frequently promotes misinformation.
