[Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica), based in the UK, is a privately held company that combines data mining and data analysis with strategic communication for the electoral process. It was created in 2013 as an offshoot of its British parent company [SCL Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCL_Group) to participate in American politics. In 2014, Cambridge Analytica was involved in 44 US political races. The company is partly owned by the family of [Robert Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer_(businessman)), an American hedge-fund manager who supports many politically conservative causes.
