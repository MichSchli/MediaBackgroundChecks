History
Founded in 2009, Before It’s News is a citizen journalism website where individuals can provide stories without credentials. Stories can range from moderately credible to tin-foil hat conspiracies. According to their
[about page](http://beforeitsnews.com/v3/about/), “As we were following the 2008 election, we noticed something very interesting — bloggers covered many of the breaking stories days before the alphabet soup news outlets (NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, AP, MSNBC, FOX, etc.). Important facts are omitted or ignored by the mainstream media because these facts inconveniently do not fit into the memes these outlets routinely promote. In other words, there is a strong bias amongst most corporate media outlets.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

In general, Before It’s News is one of the most discredited sources on the internet that promotes pseudoscience and right-wing conspiracy theories. They are also on
