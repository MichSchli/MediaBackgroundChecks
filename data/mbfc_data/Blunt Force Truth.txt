Analysis / Bias
In review, the website essentially republishes news from other hyper-partisan conservative sources. Some of these sources are on our
[questionable list](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/), such as [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [American Lookout](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-lookout/). All articles on Blunt Force Truth favor the right and are anti-left. There is a strong use of loaded language such as this: [CONFIRMED: Governor Whitmer Begs Michiganders Not to Travel to their Summer Home — Then Her Cars Are Seen Parked Outside of HER SUMMER HOME!](https://bluntforcetruth.com/news/confirmed-governor-whitmer-begs-michiganders-not-to-travel-to-their-summer-home-then-her-cars-are-seen-parked-outside-of-her-summer-home/).
In general, this a far-right biased source that rarely publishes factual information, as evidenced by their use of highly questionable sources who have terrible track records with fact-checkers.
