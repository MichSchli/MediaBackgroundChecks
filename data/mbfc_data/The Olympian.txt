In review, The Olympian covers local news and national news with minimal bias. National and international news comes from McClatchy and the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), both of which are the least biased sources.
Editorials and Op-Eds have left-leaning bias through loaded language that favors the left; for example,
[Sessions re-declares war on the 21st century](http://www.theolympian.com/opinion/editorials/article194186384.html). Further, based on a [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=the%20olympian%20newspaper&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=center-only), there isnâ€™t evidence of The Olympian ever failing a fact check.
