Analysis / Bias
In review, Die Welt publishes articles with emotionally loaded language, such as
[“New York Times” explains the German exception.”](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article207060585/Corona-Niedrige-Todesrate-New-York-Times-ueber-die-deutsche-Ausnahme.html) The report states, “How does Germany succeed? Experts give five reasons – one has to do with Angela Merkel.” Die Welt also publishes articles with a critical tone about German center-left SPD co-leader Norbert Walter-Borjans, and his tax policy: [“(Calculate) with Norbert Walter-Borjans.” ](https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article205572169/Steuerpolitik-Ver-Rechnen-mit-Norbert-Walter-Borjans.html) On the issues, they report with balance, representing all sides. For example, this story on immigration says only the facts from surveys conducted in Germany regarding immigration: [The majority of Germans think there is too much immigration](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article199334414/Migration-in-Deutschland-Zu-viel-Einwanderung-finden-52-Prozent-der-Deutschen.html).
When it comes to sourcing, Die Welt often hyperlinks to itself and to credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and sources to lesser-known but high factual sites such as [de.statista](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/statista/) and [world population review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-population-review/). When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this article, [“US President Donald Trump claims he’s ‘not a racist’ after the controversial remark.”](https://www.dw.com/en/us-president-donald-trump-claims-hes-not-a-racist-after-controversial-remark/a-42146377)
