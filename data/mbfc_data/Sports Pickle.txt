Analysis / Bias
In review, Sports Pickle publishes not so serious real sports stories such as this
[The Worst Performances at the 2018 NFL Combine](http://sportspickle.com/nfl/worst-performances-2018-nfl-combine.html) as well as straight satire such as this [Augusta National installs artificial turf to save on mowing costs](http://sportspickle.com/news/augusta-national-installs-artificial-turf-to-save-on-mowing-costs.html). Although the website does not openly disclaim they are satire they do indicate they are an entertainment website.
