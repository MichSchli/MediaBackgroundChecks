Analysis / Bias
In review, Voice of Europe reports stories from European media and frames and spins them in a misleading way that always turns out negative for immigrants and the European Union:
[“Almost 98% of gang rapists in Sweden have a migrant background”](https://voiceofeurope.com/2018/03/almost-98-of-gang-rapists-in-sweden-have-a-migrant-background/), [“Sweden reports highest number of murders in fifteen years](https://voiceofeurope.com/2018/03/sweden-reports-highest-number-of-murders-in-fifteen-years/)” Voice of Europe also has a [poor track record](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/german-soap-opera-muslim/) with fact checkers.
Voice of Europe’s stories consist of sensational click bait headlines and focus on a variety of topics that are mostly anti-immigrant with emotionally loaded headlines and content such as
[“Swedish student suspended for telling the truth about migrant sex crimes.“](https://voiceofeurope.com/2018/03/swedish-student-suspended-for-telling-the-truth-about-migrant-sex-crimes/) Voice of Europe frequently uses questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), [Gatestone Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gatestone-institute/), and [Sputnik News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/)
Overall, this site is Questionable due to extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda, conspiracy theories and poor sourcing. (M Huitsing 4/8/2018) Updated (2/11/2020)
