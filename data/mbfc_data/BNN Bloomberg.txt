Analysis / Bias
BNN Bloomberg reports business and finance news with minimal bias and uses credible sources like
[Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [www.statcan.gc.ca](http://www.statcan.gc.ca). The article [“Inflation climbs to 4.4% in April, beating expectations”](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/inflation-climbs-to-4-4-in-april-beating-expectations-1.1920768) exemplifies their neutral language and credible sourcing.
The article
[“DeSantis Is Courting Donors at Secret Dinners With One Major Line: I’m the Drama-Free Trump”](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/desantis-is-courting-donors-at-secret-dinners-with-one-major-line-i-m-the-drama-free-trump-1.1919537) may have some slight negative or skeptical tones in word choices. The article discusses different viewpoints about DeSantis, including some donors who had a positive impression of him. However, the use of certain words like “poll numbers dropping” and “donors being unimpressed” could make the tone of the article seem slightly negative or skeptical. This provides a counterbalance to the potential positive tone that may be present in other parts of the article. The sourcing includes insights from attendees at the dinners and mentions the former national co-chairman of Trump’s campaign, Roy Bailey.
Another article titled
[“AOC, Sanders Say I Told You So, as Amazon, Facebook Move to NYC”](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/aoc-sanders-say-i-told-you-so-as-amazon-facebook-move-to-nyc-1.1359108) could be seen as biased due to the phrase “I told you so.” The article itself does not contain explicit or overt bias. Still, the title and certain phrases used within the article can be seen as having a slant. In general, BNN Bloomberg is fact-based and has a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
