History
Established in 1987, The Badger Institute,
[formerly](https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/wpri-becomes-the-badger-institute) the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, is a conservative think tank that produces research and analysis on tax policy, education, health care, and the economy. [The Badger Institute](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/About/Mission-statement.htm) states that they are guided by “a belief that competitive free markets, limited government, private initiative, and personal responsibility are essential to our democratic way of life.” [Tom Howatt](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/About-US/Howatt.htm) is the Board Chairman, [Mike Nichols](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/About/Staff.htm) is the President, and [Mabel Wong](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/About/Staff.htm) is the editor. The Badger Institute publishes WI Magazine and WPRI Reports. The name of the WI magazine changed as well; the new name is [Diggings.](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/Diggings/Spring-2019.htm)
They are headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Further, according to [Sourcewatch,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/) the Badger Institute is [funded by](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Badger_Institute#cite_note-17) the Lovett and Ruth Peters Foundation, the Castle Rock Foundation, and the [Bradley Foundation](https://projects.jsonline.com/database/2017/5/Bradley-foundation-grants-2011-2015.html#!/totalamount.desc.1/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Badger Institute publishes Pro-Trump articles with strong emotional language such as this:
[“The Age of Trump: View from a supporter Never Trumpers’ myopia keeps them from seeing the greater danger that a Clinton presidency would have created”](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/WI-Magazine/Diggings1/Fall-2017/The-Age-of-Trump-View-from-a-Trump-supporter.htm) and “ [Badger Institute: Federal Grants are turning states against their own people](https://rightwisconsin.com/2019/03/29/badger-institute-federal-grants-are-turning-states-against-their-own-people).
They also published a book arguing against the minimum wage, “
[Minimum Wage: The High Cost of Increasing Minimum Wage in Wisconsin to $15.](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/Reports/2019-Volume-32/Minimum-Wage-The-High-Cost-of-Increasing-Minimum-Wage-in-Wisconsin-to-15.htm)” This book was then [endorsed](https://freebeacon.com/issues/report-minimum-wage-hike-could-cost-wisconsin-at-least-350000-jobs/) via conservative media such as the [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/) and local [Wisconsin media](https://www.kpvi.com/news/national_news/report-minimum-wage-hike-could-cost-wisconsin-at-least-jobs/article_da9ef8c9-4087-5336-bcb8-a6775fa51d43.html).
For the most part, they source from credible outlets such as
[The Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) [The Atlantic,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) [BBC,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-19587068) [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and government sources such as supremecourt.gov and less known sources such as constitution.org. When it comes to science, The Badger Institute [does not reject](https://www.badgerinstitute.org/Commentary/The-conservative-response-to-climate-change.htm) human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), although they do support free-market solutions.
