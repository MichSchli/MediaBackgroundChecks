History
[Katehon](https://katehon.com/en/about-us) is a think tank based in Russia and operated by Russian Oligarch [Konstantin Malofeev](https://katehon.com/en/about-us). The U.S. Department of State describes [Katehon](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pillars-of-Russia%E2%80%99s-Disinformation-and-Propaganda-Ecosystem_08-04-20.pdf) as an anti-Western disinformation and propaganda website. Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev is known for his [ardent](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220408-god-church-tsar-the-world-of-russian-oligarch-malofeyev-and-his-western-associates) support of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he is often referred to as [Putin’s Soros](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/putins-man-in-europe-a4fe6bb48d76/). He has an alleged connection with Europe’s far-right and far-left nationalist movements.
The U.S. first sanctioned Malofeev in 2014 for allegations that he helped finance Russian separatists in Crimea. In 2022, the U.S.
[sanctioned](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-crime-arrests-crimea-da8939a27196511528c1a95601d8fc86) Malofeev for “threatening Ukraine” and providing financial support to Russian-backed Donetsk separatists. According to the Department of Justice, [Malofeyev](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/russian-oligarch-charged-violating-united-states-sanctions) “hired American Citizen Jack Hanick to work for Malofeyev’s television network in Russia and Illegally transferred a $10 Million U.S. investment to a business associate.” [Jack Hanick](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-crime-arrests-crimea-da8939a27196511528c1a95601d8fc86) is a former [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) employee.

Analysis
Katehon’s owner and founder, Malofeev, is the founder of
[Tsargrad TV](https://www.mediamatters.org/alex-jones/alex-jones-brags-about-praise-top-putin-advisers-russian-tv-his-pro-trump-coverage). Far-right political analyst Aleksandr Dugin is the editorial director of Tsargrad TV, which is known to invite people such as conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) as a guest. Additionally, individuals leading Katehon are related to the Russian state and intelligence services. Further, other members of the board worth mentioning due to their links with the Russian state are [Sergey Glazyev](https://www.europeanceo.com/world-view/top-putin-advisor-to-leave-the-kremlin/), former adviser of President Vladimir Putin; [Andrey Klimov](https://valdaiclub.com/about/experts/295/), Deputy of the State Duma (Duma is the lower house of the Russian parliament); Leonid [Reshetnikov](https://warsawinstitute.org/fradkov-remains-helm-kremlins-intelligence-service/), retired intelligence general; and [Alexander Makarov](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pillars-of-Russia%E2%80%99s-Disinformation-and-Propaganda-Ecosystem_08-04-20.pdf), retired Lieutenant-General of the Russian Federal Security Service.
Bias
In review, Katehon presents news in line with the Russian Government’s narrative. For example, they publish pro-Putin articles with intensely emotional headlines such as
[“Victory or Nothing.”](https://katehon.com/en/article/victory-or-nothing) A quote from the article reads, “With one gesture, he put everything on the line, and with the same gesture, he cut off the retreat. This is how history is made: all or nothing. This is how a man, a subject, a free sovereign ruler lives and acts.”
Further, they report favorably on former President Trump and often unfavorable toward his opponents, such as this “
[Donald Trump Or Nuclear War?](https://katehon.com/en/article/donald-trump-or-nuclear-war)” A quote from the article reads, “Hillary means war.” While “Trump embodies realism.” Furthermore, they also publish disinformation directed at Trump’s opponents, such as this “ [Phone Calls Between Biden And Ukraine’s Poroshenko Leaked; Details $1 Billion “Quid Pro Quo” To Fire Burisma Prosecutor.”](https://katehon.com/en/article/phone-calls-between-biden-and-ukraines-poroshenko-leaked-details-1-billion-quid-pro-quo-fire)
When it comes to sourcing, they often utilize conspiracy-pseudoscience sources such as
[ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) and credible sources such as [Brookings Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/). They also publish videos from Far-Right American conspiracy theorists such as [Tucker Carlson](https://katehon.com/en/video/tucker-we-are-war-russia) and [Steve Bannon](https://katehon.com/en/video/economic-war-world-80-miles-convoy-heads-ohio) (former adviser to then-President Trump).
Katehon has also promoted misinformation and conspiracy theories such as
[Genocide occurring to Russians in the Donbas](https://katehon.com/en/article/geopolitical-idleness-about-ukraine), [Ukrainian Nazism](https://katehon.com/en/article/war-reality-check), and [Covid-19 disinformation](https://katehon.com/en/article/triumph-evil). In general, Katehon is a Far-Right biased think tank that routinely publishes misinformation, pro-Russian propaganda, and conspiracy theories.
