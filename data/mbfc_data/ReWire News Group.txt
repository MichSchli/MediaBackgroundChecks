Analysis / Bias
In review, Rewire News Group primarily covers reproductive news with moderately loaded words such as this:
[Telemedicine Abortion Is Safe, No Matter What Anti-Choice Lawmakers Claim](https://rewire.news/article/2019/07/23/telemedicine-abortion-is-safe-no-matter-what-anti-choice-lawmakers-claim/). This story is properly sourced to medical journals as well as the think tank [Guttmacher Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/alan-guttmacher-institute/) and [Amnesty International](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/amnesty-international/). Other stories cover economic justice, such as this: [Trump’s Newest Plan for SNAP Would Trap Workers in Poverty](https://rewire.news/article/2019/07/29/trumps-newest-plan-for-snap-would-trap-workers-in-poverty/). Again, this is sourced properly to the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-center-on-budget-and-policy-priorities/). When it comes to science they support the [consensus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on [climate change](https://rewire.news/article/2011/08/17/numbers-population-consumption-reproductive-health/). In general, Rewire News Group reports news with a strong left-leaning political bias but properly sources their information to factual content.
