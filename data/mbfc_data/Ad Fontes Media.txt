Analysis / Bias
First and foremost, we did not want to review this website or the chart as we consider this a friend or competitor depending on how you view it. We prefer friends, just as we view
[Allsides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news). All of us have the same mission, which is to inform about the bias of media sources. However, we have had so many requests we felt we should weigh in for what it is worth. We really do not have any problem with this chart and feel it is mostly accurate.
Vanessa Otero states on her FAQ page that “I consider myself to be moderately liberal.” That is just fine as long as it is backed up with a
[reasonable methodology](https://adfontesmedia.com/how-ad-fontes-ranks-news-sources/), as the Media Bias Chart is.
In a review of the chart, it is within the ballpark of how Media Bias Fact Check rates its sources. In other words, the sources on the right belong on the right, and the ones on the left belong on the left. For what it is worth, we think this is a decent chart that should be shared. In general, Ad Fontes rates the bias and credibility of media sources with a sound methodology that is low-biased and accurate.
