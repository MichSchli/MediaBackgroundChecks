Analysis / Bias
In review, Stat News produces fact-based stories and information on medical and health news. Articles and headlines related to health and medicine generally use low biased wording such as this
[FDA delays approval decision for Biogen’s Alzheimer’s treatment](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/29/biogen-aducanumab-fda-decision-delay/). However, they also report on politics with more emotional wording such as this [How a billionaire couple greased the skids for Nancy Pelosi’s drug pricing bill.](https://www.statnews.com/2019/11/26/laura-john-arnold-billionaire-greased-the-skids-for-drug-pricing-bill/) When it comes to sourcing, Stat News properly sources from credible media outlets and pro-science sources.
Editorially, Stat News holds views that more align with the left. For example, they frequently criticize former President Donald Trump over his science positions, such as this
[Trump officials actively lobbied to deny states money for vaccine rollout last fall](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/31/trump-officials-lobbied-to-deny-states-money-for-vaccine-rollout/), and this [Undercounting of Covid-19 deaths is greatest in pro-Trump areas, analysis shows](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/25/undercounting-covid-19-deaths-greatest-in-pro-trump-areas-analysis-shows/). On the other hand, they tend to report more favorably on the Biden Administration, such as this [Biden is set to block dozens of Trump’s last-minute health regulations](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/20/biden-set-to-block-dozens-trump-health-regulations/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
