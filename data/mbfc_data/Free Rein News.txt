Analysis / Bias
In review, Free Rein News is a strongly left biased news and opinion website where all articles favor the left and/or denigrate the right. There is significant use of loaded emotional language in headlines, such as: “
[Congressman Absolutely Shreds Trump With Ridiculing Pictures, Treats Trump Like A Child (IMAGE)](http://frnewsreport.com/congressman-absolutely-shreds-trump-with-ridiculing-pictures-treats-trump-like-a-child-image/)” However, the wording of articles is less emotional and direct in tone, though certainly favorable to the left. All articles reviewed are sourced back to verifiable media outlets such as [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and [Los Angeles Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) Although headlines are very sensational, the content of articles is reasonably written and properly sourced.
