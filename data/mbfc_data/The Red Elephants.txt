History
Founded in 2016, The Red Elephants have an
[about page](http://theredelephants.com/about/), but who maintains the site is unknown. They describe their mission as “The Red Elephants is an organization of like-minded conservatives that have come together to spread awareness and truth.” The website completely lacks transparency.

Analysis / Bias
The Red Elephants reports all news with an extreme right-wing bias as they use loaded and sensational headlines such as this: ‘
[LIAWATHA’ – ‘POCAHONTAS’ – ‘CHIEF SPREADING BULL’ – LOOK OUT, LIZ WARREN AT IT AGAIN](http://theredelephants.com/liawatha-pocahontas-chief-spreading-bull-look-liz-warren/)!” Further, they source poorly, if at all, for example: “ [SCREW THE INFRASTRUCTURE, CALIFORNIA JUST PROPOSED A BILL TO HELP TRANSGENDER INMATES…”](http://theredelephants.com/screw-infrastructure-california-just-proposed-bill-help-transgender-inmates-change-names/) The Red Elephants also report conspiracy theories such as: “ [OBAMA SHADOW GOVERNMENT: WIRETAPPING AND ROBO-CALLS?”](http://theredelephants.com/obama-shadow-government-wiretapping-robo-calls/) They have also published fake news stories such as: ‘ [Democrats Legalize Child Prostitution in California](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/intentionally-or-not-big-brands-help-fund-fake-news/),” which is [refuted by fact checkers](http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/jan/04/travis-allen/lawmakers-claim-about-california-legalizing-child-/).
During 2020 – 2021 The Red Elephants frequently promoted false and misleading information regarding the Coronavirus and the Presidential election. For example, they make false statements such as this
[Donald Trump Won the Election On Election Night — Now Media Reinforces What the BBC Calls Textbook Election Fraud, Declare Joe Biden the Victor Anyway](https://theredelephants.com/donald-trump-won-the-election-on-election-night-now-media-reinforces-what-the-bbc-calls-textbook-election-fraud-declare-joe-biden-the-victor-anyway/). Regarding Coronavirus, they have made false statements such as this [CDC Now Admits that Only 6% of COVID Deaths are Caused by COVID Alone. The Rest Included Cardiac Arrest, Flu, and Other Causes](https://theredelephants.com/cdc-now-admits-that-only-6-of-covid-deaths-are-caused-by-covid-alone-the-rest-included-cardiac-arrest-flu-and-other-causes/).
