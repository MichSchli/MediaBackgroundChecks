Analysis / Bias
Crux publishes news stories related to the Catholic Church and Catholicism. The website features original reporting by staff as well as the Catholic News Service and Catholic News Agency. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded emotional wording such as this
[Canada indigenous demand Church admit role in ‘genocide,’ rescind colonization edicts](https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-americas/2022/03/canada-indigenous-demand-church-admit-role-in-genocide-rescind-colonization-edicts). Articles are usually sourced through quotes rather than hyperlinks.
Editorially, they do not have a dedicated opinion section, but they label news with opinions as “news analysis.” A review of story selection reveals they cover both sides, with some favoring the right such as this
[Colorado bishops protest abortion bill, saying God, not government, rules on life](https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2022/03/colorado-bishops-protest-abortion-bill-saying-god-not-government-rules-on-life) and some on the left [Catholic school administrators back students’ call to address race issues](https://cruxnow.com/cns/2022/03/catholic-school-administrators-back-students-call-to-address-race-issues). In general, Crux publishes factual news and provides a balance of opinions.
