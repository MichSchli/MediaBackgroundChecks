Analysis / Bias
In review, Information Liberation is a news and opinion website with an extreme right-wing bias. Virtually every article reports positively for conservative causes and negatively for liberals. Information Liberation uses loaded words to convey either positive or negative emotions, such as this:
[Hillary Clinton Scolds Trump Over Syria, Explains Why We Need Permanent War](http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=59600).
While Information Liberation does publish credible news that is sourced properly, it also publishes news that is sourced to right-wing biased, conspiracy, and questionable sources. They provide a list of sources they link to on their sidebar. This list reads like a who’s who of conspiracy and questionable sources such as
[InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and the [Center for Immigration Studies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-immigration-studies-cis/). They also perform misleading fact checks such as this: [FACT CHECK: Hillary Said 90% of Clinton Foundation Donations go to Charity. Actual Number? 5.7%](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=55710). This fact check simply is not true. Either this is a very poorly done fact check, or they were intentionally trying to mislead. The actual number that goes to charity is 89%. The deception in this fact check is in the wording. 5.7% of donations go to outside charity groups; this much is true. With this fact check Information Liberation is misleading people to believe that only 5.7% goes to actual charity when it is closer to 90%.
In general, Information Liberation is a right-wing disinformation propaganda site.
