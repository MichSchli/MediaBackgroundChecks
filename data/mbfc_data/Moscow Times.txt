From 1992 until 2017, it was in print with a peak circulation of 55,000.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Moscow Times has been called a “
[militant anti-Putin paper](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/russia-moscow-times-cyber-attack), a digest of the Western press with extreme bias in covering events in Russia.” They cover Russian national news, politics, and culture for an English language reader. The website offers original reporting straightforwardly, such as this: [Admitted Russian Agent Butina Freed From U.S. Prison Ahead of Expected Deportation](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/10/25/admitted-russian-agent-butina-freed-from-us-prison-ahead-of-expected-deportation-a67919). This story is properly sourced to [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Another example of a low-biased story is [Russia’s Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates on Economic Fears](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/10/25/russia-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-a67908). When it comes to reporting on USA news, the Moscow Times has a negative opinion of Donald Trump and his relationship with Putin, such as this: [Trump Isn’t Putin’s Puppet. He’s Just Unfit for Office](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/10/23/trump-isnt-putins-puppet-hes-just-unfit-for-office-a67869).
Editorially, the Moscow Times is opposed to Putin such as this
[20 Years of Vladimir Putin: The Rise and Decline of a Regime](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/09/20-years-of-vladimir-putin-the-rise-and-decline-of-a-regime-a66782) and pro-Democracy such as this: [Russia’s Political Prisoner Population Grew Sixfold in 4 Years – NGO](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/07/10/russias-political-prisoner-population-grew-sixfold-in-4-years-ngo-a66348). In general, the Moscow Times reports the complete opposite of [RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) and [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/) and is factually sourced.
