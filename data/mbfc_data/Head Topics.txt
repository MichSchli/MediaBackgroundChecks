History
[Founded in 2017,](http://whois.domaintools.com/headtopics.com) with the domain registered in Germany, Head Topics is a left-leaning news and opinion source that completely lacks transparency. This website does not have an about page, disclosure of ownership, or names associated with articles. Because we cannot verify Head Topics is headquartered in Germany, we will list them as unknown, which is another strike against Transparency.
Funded by / Ownership
Head Topics does not disclose ownership, and revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Head Topics does not report original content but rather sources other content or simply copies snippets of stories and links to the original source. Most stories link to
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) Breaking news, with others leading to least biased sources. It is not that the news published on Head Topics is false, it just is not original, and there is zero accountability as to the originator of the news published here. There is no reason to fact-check Head Topics as they do not produce original content.
