Analysis / Bias
In review, Navy Times covers military news and defense policy with the use of minimally loaded language such as this:
[Austal launches future expeditionary fast transport](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/02/21/austal-launches-future-expeditionary-fast-transport/) and [Midshipman dies after being found unresponsive at Naval Academy](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/02/21/midshipman-dies-after-being-found-unresponsive-at-naval-academy/) All information in articles is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Military Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-times/) and .gov sites. Editorially, they are balanced with primarily centrist views that slightly lean left on the issues of gender and lean right in their support of military strength. In general, Navy Times covers military news with very low bias in reporting.
