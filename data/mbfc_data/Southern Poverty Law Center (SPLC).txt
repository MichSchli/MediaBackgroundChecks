History
Launched in 1971,
[The Southern Poverty Law Center (The SPLC)](https://www.splcenter.org/about) is a legal advocacy group that reports inequality, litigating, and tracking hate groups across the United States. Their [history page](https://www.splcenter.org/about-us/our-history) describes their founding purpose as a “civil rights law practice that would provide a voice for the disenfranchised.” They [state](https://www.splcenter.org/about-us/our-history) their accomplishments over the years as “dismantled vestiges of Jim Crow, reformed juvenile justice practices, shattered barriers to equality for women, children, the LGBT community and the disabled, protected low-wage immigrant workers from exploitation, and more.” [Joseph J. Levin, Jr](https://www.splcenter.org/about/board-member/joseph-j-levin-jr) is the co-founder, and the other co-founder, Morris Dees, was fired (March 2019), and his biography was [removed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-splc/southern-poverty-law-center-fires-its-co-founder-chief-litigator-idUSKCN1QV37I) from its website. Bryan Fair is the chairman, and the SPLC is headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama, USA.
In summary, during the 1980s, The Southern Poverty Law Center began monitoring, tracking, and exposing a wide variety of hate and extremist organizations, including white supremacists and The Klan. In the 1990s, the SPLC launched the
[Teaching Tolerance program](https://www.splcenter.org/teaching-tolerance) to provide educators with free, anti-bias classroom resources such as classroom documentaries and lesson plans.
The issues covered by the group are
[listed](https://www.splcenter.org/issues) as “Hate & Extremism, Children’s Rights, Immigrant Justice, LGBT Rights, Economic Justice, Criminal Justice Reform, and Voting Rights.” They also have a section called [Hatewatch](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch), a blog that monitors and exposes the “American radical right.” SPLC has published an annual census of hate groups operating within the United States through their [hate map](https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map). The SPLC states they use a variety of methodologies to determine the activities of groups and individuals. These include “reviewing hate group publications and reports by citizens, law enforcement, field sources and the news media, and conducting our own investigations.” The [hate map](https://www.splcenter.org/20171004/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups#hate%20group) depicts the locations of hate group chapters, such as racist and anti-Semitic organizations.

Analysis
On March 29, 2019, The Southern Poverty Law Center (The SPLC) had an internal
[conflict](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/morris-dees-leaves-splc.html), resulting in co-founder Morris Dees being dismissed after current and former employees filed complaints, including sexual harassment and a lack of diversity in race and gender. The incident was covered by media, including [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/29/us/splc-leadership-crisis/index.html) and [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/southern-poverty-law-center-which-frequently-targets-conservatives-accused-by-staffers-of-spreading-intolerance), who reported on the incident. The far-right Christian Family Research Council has also criticized the SLPC as “using smear tactics, intimidation, ritualized defamation, and a knack for fundraising to silence its political opponents” The [Family Research Council (FRC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/family-research-council/) is [designated](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council) as an anti-LGBTQ hate group.
As well as exposing the activities of the American radical right and white supremacist, the Southern Poverty Law Center also designated radical groups such as “
[The New Black Panther Party](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/new-black-panther-party)” (not to be confused with the Black Panther Party) and [the Nation of Islam (NOI)](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam) as a hate group. Their [FAQ](https://www.splcenter.org/20171004/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups#isis) section explains why they don’t list Antifa as a hate group and answer questions such as how they classify anti-immigrant hate groups and anti-LGBT hate groups.
In 2018, SPLC President
[Richard Cohen](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2018/06/18/splc-statement-regarding-maajid-nawaz-and-quilliam-foundation) posted an apology and paid a financial settlement to Maajid Nawaz and the Quilliam Foundation to mischaracterize them as anti-Muslim extremists. Further, SPLC apologized to Ben Carson and removed his designation in their [Extremist Files](https://web.archive.org/web/20150212180024/https://secure.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-statement-on-dr-ben-carson).
Bias
The Southern Poverty Law Center uses emotionally loaded headlines such as these:
[“President Trump is stoking white nationalism, exploiting racist fear”](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2018/08/23/president-trump-stoking-white-nationalism-exploiting-racist-fear) and [“In wake of Trump’s ‘shithole’ comment, celebration among the far right.”](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/01/12/wake-trump%E2%80%99s-shithole-comment-celebration-among-far-right) Further, the SPLC sources their information with quotes, video/audio evidence but often does not hyperlink to other sources. In general, the majority of articles published by SPLC favor the left and portray the right negatively.
Hate groups and the far-right often criticize the SPLC as being extremely left-biased. This is not accurate. The SPLC applies a methodology to their designations that are consistent no matter what side (left or right) the groups are on. SPLC explains on their FAQ page that there are more hate groups affiliated with the right, based on their
[definition](https://www.splcenter.org/20171004/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups#isis) of a hate group, which states “has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” This definition is similar to the [FBI’s definition](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes) of what constitutes a hate crime.
