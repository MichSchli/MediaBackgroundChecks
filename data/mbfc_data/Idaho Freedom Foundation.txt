Analysis / Bias
The Idaho Freedom Foundation primarily promotes limited government and free markets, reflecting a strong conservative libertarian bias in its mission. However, it’s worth noting that among the articles we’ve analyzed, the organization has expressed critical views on topics such as vaccines and LGBTQ+ issues.
The first article we analyzed was
[“Heartbreaking: Idaho Man Paralyzed After Receiving COVID-19 Vaccine.”](https://idahofreedom.org/heartbreaking-idaho-man-paralyzed-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine/) This article uses emotionally loaded language and framing to emphasize an individual’s negative experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. It uses negative language to criticize government officials for promoting vaccination, implying they lack knowledge and portraying their efforts as dangerous. This language is biased and seeks to influence readers’ opinions negatively about vaccination campaigns and their supporters. A quote from the article reads, “Gov. Little and other members who hold a higher power in the state of Idaho have continued to encourage Idahoans to become vaccinated. Their dangerous, uneducated push for people to become vaccinated has led one man to lose almost everything he has worked for.” It cites sources like the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/openvaers-bias/)) and personal accounts to highlight potential risks associated with vaccination. However, the article does not provide verifiable evidence to support causation between the vaccine and the individual’s health issues.
Another article we analyzed was
[“Our Plan to Combat The Trans Agenda: Following Judge Winmill’s Idiotic Ruling.”](https://idahofreedom.org/our-plan-to-combat-the-trans-agenda-following-judge-winmills-idiotic-ruling/) In this article, Wayne Hoffman strongly opposes transgender rights and healthcare, criticizing U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill’s decision as “idiotic.” He accuses the judge of being “leftist” and makes controversial comparisons between transgender rights and other issues. Hoffman calls for actions such as ending taxpayer funding for medical schools teaching gender surgeries and opposing Medicaid funding for transgender-related medical conditions. Overall, the article strongly opposes transgender rights and frames it as a mission to protect against the “Left’s diabolical agenda.”
Additionally, the Idaho Freedom Foundation has been the subject of multiple complaints alleging
[violations of nonprofit rules.](https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/07/07/multiple-complaints-accuse-idaho-freedom-foundation-of-breaking-nonprofit-rules/) Notably, in a December 12, 2023 [article](https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/12/12/influential-idaho-freedom-foundation-quietly-hired-alt-right-propagandist-to-help-shape-messaging/) by the [Idaho Capital Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/idaho-capital-sun-bias/), it was reported that the Idaho Freedom Foundation (IFF) hired Dave Reilly, described as an alt-right propagandist, to assist in crafting its messaging. [Brent Regan](https://www.idahotribune.org/common-sense) is one of the [directors of the Idaho Freedom Foundation](https://kootenaidemocrats.org/regan-and-the-idaho-freedom-foundation-insult-and-undermine-voters/) and writes for the Questionable [Idaho Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/idaho-tribune-bias/).
