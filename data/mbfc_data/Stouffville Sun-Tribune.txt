[New Community Health Clinic set to open in Stouffville on May 15](https://www.therecord.com/local-stouffville/news/2023/05/11/new-community-health-clinic-set-to-open-in-stouffville-on-may-15.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
