History
Founded in 1977 by Donald Ellis Wildmon, an ordained United Methodist minister, author, and former radio host, the American Family Association (AFA) is a non-profit organization based in the United States that promotes fundamentalist Christian values. It opposes same-sex marriage, pornography, and abortion.
According to their
[about page](https://www.afa.net/who-we-are/our-mission/), “The American Family Association believes that God has communicated absolute truth to mankind and that all people are subject to the authority of God’s Word at all times. Therefore AFA believes that a culture based on biblical truth best serves the well-being of our nation and our families, in accordance with the vision of our founding documents, and that personal transformation through the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the greatest agent of biblical change in any culture.”
The AFA is considered an anti-LGBT hate group by the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/american-family-association). [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the sole purpose of this organization and website is to promote Protestant Fundamentalism. The information published on this website is always in favor of the Christian Right and denigrates the left harshly. There is often frequent use of loaded emotional language, such as in this anti-LGBTQ article:
[I Will Say What the Political Leaders Cannot Say About Pete Buttigieg](https://www.afa.net/the-stand/culture/2020/02/i-will-say-what-the-political-leaders-cannot-say-about-pete-buttigieg/). Interestingly, what he says he admits is extreme bigotry, but that does not stop him: “It is certainly politically incorrect to say this. In fact, in the eyes of many, what I’m about to say is a classic example of extreme religious bigotry. But I will say it nonetheless. Choosing an out and proud “married” gay man to run for president, let alone become president, would contribute to the further degeneration and moral confusion of our society along with further attacks on our most fundamental rights.” This story exemplifies typical content on this website.
This source has also made several claims that have been considered hate,
[such as this](https://www.afa.net/blogs/blogpost.aspx?id=2147494882) “Homosexuality gave us Adolph Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and 6 million dead Jews.”
Several organizations and sources have claimed AFA as a hate group:
