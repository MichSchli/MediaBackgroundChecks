Analysis / Bias
Under the bookshop section, they sell books such as “
[Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming: The NIPCC Report on Scientific Consensus.”](https://shop.acton.org/products/why-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming-the-nipcc-report-on-scientific-consensus)
In this interview, the President and founder of The Acton Institute,
[Father Robert Alan Sirico](https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=99-P13-00043&segmentID=7), voices his opinion about climate change “What this represents is a national and to some extent international movement of eco-spirituality, eco-theology, which in some instances borders on neo-Paganism. I think this will not have an appeal in the minds and hearts of the average Michigan churchgoer.”
In another interview with public radio,
[Fr. Sirico ](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114shrg20944/pdf/CHRG-114shrg20944.pdf)states, “Well, I think it is fair to say that when you wage what is in effect a war on coal or fossil fuels, what you end up doing is increasing the cost of those resources. When you increase the cost of those resources, the poor are further impoverished.”
The Acton Institute website consists of journals, articles, videos, and podcasts. Articles are published with strong, emotionally loaded language such as
[“Time to chill about the fiery climate apocalypse”](https://www.acton.org/religion-liberty/volume-30-number-4/time-chill-about-fiery-climate-apocalypse) and [“No, Tucker Carlson: The U.S. is not, will not, and never should be like Hungary.”](https://blog.acton.org/archives/122415-no-tucker-carlson-the-u-s-is-not-will-not-and-never-should-be-like-hungary.html)
When it comes to sourcing, they utilize credible sources such as
[Scientific American:](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/scientific-american/) [“I’m Rich, and You’re Not. So There.”](https://blog.acton.org/archives/31422-im-rich-and-youre-not-so-there.html) Although the source is credible, the article is misleading as they are refuting a scientific study. In the article above, “Time to chill about the fiery climate apocalypse,” they rely on Michael Shellenberger as a source. Michael Shellenberger is a well-known climate skeptic who has [failed fact checks](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Michael%20Shellenberger). They also use mostly factual sources such as Libertarian-leaning free-market think tank [mackinac.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mackinac-center-for-public-policy/) and public policy think tank [Hoover Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hoover-institution/). In general, Acton Institute does not support the consensus of science regarding climate change and holds a conservative-libertarian editorial bias.
Failed Fact Checks
- None by third-party fact-checkers.
- Consistently relies on sources that fail fact checks, especially in regards to
[climate change](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Shellenberger). See above.
