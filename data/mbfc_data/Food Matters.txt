History
Food Matters originally began as a
[movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Matters) in 2008 and then became a popular website that features information about food and diet. The website is based in Australia. [Read our profile on Australian media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/australia-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The website is unclear on ownership or funding, but a shop sells pseudoscience-related health products and books.
Analysis / Bias
While not all of the information contained on the website is pseudoscience, there is still plenty of it. For instance, they promote the highly controversial and
[dangerous](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-gerson-protocol-and-the-death-of-jess-ainscough/) [Gerson Therapy](http://www.foodmatters.com/article/the-worlds-simplest-cure-for-cancer) as a [cure for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/). There is [zero scientific evidence](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson) that Gerson Therapy works. Food Matters also promotes [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) by using questionable studies that they donâ€™t link to. Besides miracle cures, they promote [anti-Gmo propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and other dubious information to sell products.
