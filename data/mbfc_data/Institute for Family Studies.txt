History
The Institute for Family Studies (IFS) is a conservative think tank that states its mission as “to strengthen marriage and family life, and advance the well-being of children through research and public education.” IFS was founded by
[William Bradford Wilcox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Bradford_Wilcox), who is the Director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, a [Professor of Sociology](https://sociology.virginia.edu/people/faculty/bradford-wilcox) at the University of Virginia, and a Visiting Scholar at the conservative [American Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-enterprise-institute/). Michael Toscano is the current Executive Director. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded By / Ownership
The Institute for Family Studies does not openly state ownership on the website, nor do they list funding sources. According to
[Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), they have [received funding](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Institute_for_Family_Studies) from the conservative [Bradley Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Foundation). They accept donations on the website as well.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) reports on and researches the role of marriage on the health of children and society. Most information on this website is rooted in fact and is well-sourced. There is little use of loaded language; however, story selection favors the conservative view of traditional marriage. While IFS does not come out directly and say they oppose same-sex marriage, they routinely promote two-parent heterosexual families as the ideal.
In 2012, Bradford Wilcox was a
[peer reviewer](http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/08/02/controversy-continues-over-gay-parenting-study) on a [controversial research paper](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/suspect-science) called “disgraceful” by the scientific community. This research was funded by the highly Questionable [Witherspoon Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/witherspoon-institute/), which promotes anti-gay marriage and anti-abortion propaganda. While IFS tend to be well-sourced, their senior fellow Mr. Wilcox endorsed a poor scientific study.
