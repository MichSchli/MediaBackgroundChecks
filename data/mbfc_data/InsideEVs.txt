History
Launched in 2012, InsideEVs is a website that features online car reviews, news, and everything related to plug-in electric vehicles. According to their
[about page](https://insideevs.com/info/), InsideEVs describes itself as created not only “to publish the breaking news of the day about electric vehicles, but to dissect it, promote it, and, most importantly, examine the how what, and why of electric vehicles.” InsideEVs is [headquartered](https://insideevs.com/info/contact/) in Miami, Florida, and has global offices worldwide. Its sister site, [MYEV.com](https://www.myev.com/about-us), is “a marketplace and knowledge-base for everything EV.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, InsideEVs publishes news articles related to electric vehicles with emotionally loaded language, such as
[“Tesla May Lose Another Top Exec Over Suspicious Supply Order.”](https://insideevs.com/news/599927/tesla-elon-musk-omead-afshar-suspicious-order/) A quote from the article reads: “It’s important to note up front that reports related to this story came from anonymous sources familiar with the matter.” The body of the article is written in a tabloid-style with another quote: “As the story goes, the director of the office of the CEO at Tesla, Omead Afshar, is under scrutiny due to reports that he may have ordered some type of special glass for Musk.”
Another political article focusing on technology is:
[“Trump Vs. Biden: The Politics Of Plug-Ins And What May Change.”](https://insideevs.com/news/454069/trump-vs-biden-ev-policy-changes/) The subtitle states, “President-elect Biden is expected to support EVs more than outgoing President Trump.” In another example of a political article, “ [Trump Spouts More Electric Car Misinformation At Recent Rally,”](https://insideevs.com/news/609373/trump-anti-electric-car-speech/) a quote reads, “Trump has made it clear recently that he’s not too happy with Tesla’s Elon Musk, and he suddenly no longer supports EVs.” The author also compares Biden and Trump by stating, “Thankfully, the current administration is aware of the problem with charging infrastructure, and it’s already working to fix it.” Finally, the author concludes that “Sadly, based on how he seems to feel about EVs, it’s more likely that Trump will work to have them eliminated. In the speech, he actually does say we need to get rid of electric vehicles.”
InsideEVs sources their information from various sources such as electrek.co, autonews.com,
[The Verge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/), and [Bloomberg;](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) however, they sometimes use social media and youtube as sources which is difficult to verify. Generally, reporting is fact-based and leans left in support of electric vehicles and the [environment](https://insideevs.com/features/482433/electric-cars-fight-climate-change/).
