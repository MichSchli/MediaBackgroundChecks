[Stars and Stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)) is an American military newspaper that focuses and reports on matters concerning the United States Armed Forces members. It operates from inside the Department of Defense but is editorially separate from it, and its First Amendment protection is safeguarded by the United States Congress, to whom an independent ombudsman, who serves the readers’ interests, regularly reports.
According to their
