Analysis / Bias
In review, The News-Gazette uses credible sources in their reporting. For example, they often republish articles from the
[Associated Press,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) under their Nation/World News subcategory: “ [Trump to pitch tax plan as boon for truckers”](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/nationworld/2017-10-11/trump-pitch-tax-plan-boon-truckers.html). The News-Gazette, editorially endorsed neither Trump nor Clinton: [Nobody for president](http://www.news-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2016-10-02/nobody-president.html). However, the News-Gazette tends to slightly [favor the right](http://www.news-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2017-10-09/campus-conflict.html) editorially.
