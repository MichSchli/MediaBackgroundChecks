[Few jaywalking tickets issued as Victoria struggles to keep pedestrians safe](https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/crime/few-jaywalking-tickets-issued-as-victoria-struggles-to-keep-pedestrians/article_861a14ba-0b21-11ea-a604-77de5dcf4052.html). [National and world](https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/nation/) news comes almost exclusively from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, the Victoria Advocate does not endorse political candidates. Op-Eds, on the other hand, present both sides; however, more tend to slightly favor the left, such as these:
