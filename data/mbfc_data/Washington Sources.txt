History
Washington Sources (formally Groopspeak) is a news and opinion website that does not have an about page, author information, or funding disclosure. In the past, Washington Sources would frequently publish misinformation about former President Trump; however, at this time, they appear to have changed to a general news website.

Funded by /Ownership
Again, this source chooses not to disclose ownership or funding (red flag). The website appears to be funded by online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Washington Sources covers general news with an emphasis on entertainment news. Articles and headlines contain minimal emotional wording such as this
[The CDC Increases Booster Rollout And Approves Shot Mixing.](https://washingtonsources.org/the-cdc-increases-booster-rollout-and-approves-shot-mixing/) Articles are usually properly sourced from credible media outlets.
Editorially, when covering politics, they typically do not add commentary and link to the original source, such as this
[Hillary Clintonâ€™s 60 Minutes Interview In 1992 Caused Immense Regret For Many Involved](https://washingtonsources.org/hillary-clintons-60-minutes-interview-in-1992-caused-immense-regret-for-many-involved/). In general, the website is low biased but completely lacks transparency rendering it not credible.
