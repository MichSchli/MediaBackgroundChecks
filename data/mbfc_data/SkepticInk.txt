Analysis / Bias
In review, Skeptic Ink is a blog/website that publishes scientific and skeptical information. Most articles are emotional and do not properly source their information, such as this
[OPERATION HAND OF GOD](https://skepticink.com/lateraltruth/2020/10/15/operation-hand-of-god/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=operation-hand-of-god). This opinion piece is not sourced at all. There is again zero sourcing from other sources in another titled [THE UNNECESSARY SCIENCE â€“ A USEFUL SUMMARY](https://skepticink.com/onusloom/2020/11/14/the-unnecessary-science-a-useful-summary/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-unnecessary-science-a-useful-summary). This is a mostly pro-science source, but with the lack of sourcing and transparency, we render them Questionable by default.
