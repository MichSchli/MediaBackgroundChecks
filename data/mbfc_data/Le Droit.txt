History
[Le Droit](https://j-source.ca/this-week-in-canadian-media-history-le-droit-founded-in-1913/) is a French-language newspaper [founded](https://todayinottawashistory.wordpress.com/2021/03/27/le-droit/) in 1913 by local clergy and businessmen in Ottawa. After Le Temps shut down, Le Droit was established to provide French-speaking Catholics in Ottawa with a local news source.
Le Droit covers local, national, and international news, focusing on Francophone communities. Le Droit is headquartered in Ottawa and offers both print and online editions. According to
[CBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/) (Canadian Broadcasting), [The Quebec government](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/quebec-invests-five-million-in-le-droit-to-help-it-survive-1.5252552) granted [$5M](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/capitales-media-bankruptcy-1.5252411) in 2019 to prevent bankruptcy and sustain Le Droit and other publications owned by Groupe Capitales Médias.

Analysis / Bias
According to
[CBC News,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/) in 2019, the city of Gatineau pledged to support the Le Droit newspaper by purchasing ads [“City will buy $150,000 of advertising over next 3 years.”](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-le-droit-advertising-money-1.5333089) At the time, Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin was the Mayor of Gatineau and a part of the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) party, a [right-wing](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/adq-leader-dismisses-plans-for-new-party-1.920674) populist and conservative party.
Le Droit sometimes uses emotionally loaded language in its headlines, such as this:
[“Trump’s reality show.”](https://www.ledroit.com/2023/04/05/la-tele-realite-de-trump-1391b2d98eefedf54e28a3065e64ee7d) A quote from the article states, “His arraignment on Tuesday fits perfectly into his lifelong narrative, that of a victim.” The article’s tone is critical of Trump, with the language used conveying a sense of skepticism and even sarcasm.
In another article about Justin Trudeau,
[“The fluctuating discourse of Justin Trudeau,”](https://www.ledroit.com/2023/01/27/le-discours-fluctuant-de-justin-trudeau-15de2666322d80c0c9e8aae51915904b) the article is critical of Justin Trudeau’s government. It conveys a negative view through sarcastic language. Such as “The suspense is over. Justin Trudeau will finally deign to sit down with his provincial counterparts to discuss health funding.” and “Not wanting to antagonize anyone ahead of this summit, the Liberal government has stopped talking about ‘conditions’ and is using formulas giving the impression that it has watered down its wine.” The choice of words conveys a sense of skepticism and criticism towards the government’s actions.
Le Droit covers national and international news using the

A review of op-eds reflects diverse opinions with a reasonable balance between right and left. In general, Le Droit is fact-based and demonstrates minimal bias in news reporting.
