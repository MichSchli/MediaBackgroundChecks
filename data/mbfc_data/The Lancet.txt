Analysis / Bias
In review, The journal publishes original research articles, review articles, editorials, book reviews, correspondence, news features, and case reports. All research studies are peer-reviewed. The Lancet also publishes
[17 speciality journals](https://www.thelancet.com/about-us). Further, The Lancet is frequently sourced in significant publications such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and numerous fact-checkers.
In the past, The Lancet has published studies that required retraction. For example, The Lancet was criticized after it published a paper in 1998 in which the authors suggested a link between the
[ MMR vaccine and autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). This study was appropriately retracted in 2010.
