History
Founded in 2016, and according to their
[about page](https://www.blabber.buzz/about), “BlabberBuzz was founded during the contentious 2016 presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This particular election brought the topics of “fake news,” censorship, and polarizing divisions to the forefront of America’s conversations. The founders of BlabberBuzz felt that free speech and expression, FOR ALL POLITICAL SPECTRUMS, should never be stifled by tech companies, government, and media giants. Therefore, we decided to create a platform that gives its users perspective of how these conversations unfold in mainstream and political media. More importantly, however, we want to give America’s voice back to where it rightfully belongs, the American people.”
BlabberBuzz requests you sign up to see all their news and asks if you are liberal or conservative. Because this website has been sending me far right info I signed up as a liberal. Let’s review.

BlabberBuzz does not disclose information about who is behind the website. However, a reader has
[submitted an article](https://powerinbox.com/blog/qa-with-the-influencers-experts-driving-digital-innovation-in-marketing-adtech/) that indicates Elie Ashery is the CEO of Gold Lasso, an email automation service, and is Managing Director of DEMY Media. According to the article, “Élie is the mastermind behind the BlabberBuzz social media platform.” Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, after signing up for BlabberBuzz as a liberal, I am seeing nothing but pro-right news stories that are denigrating the left consistently. It seems the whole premise of this website is to have right-leaning people post right-wing news that people can comment on. Obviously, sources do not matter, as the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) was prominently featured and has failed numerous fact checks. It is also possible I do not understand the motivation of this website as it is 100% pro-Trump and right biased, while at the same time asking for right or left affiliation to deliver the news. Seems like a right-wing propaganda website.
In 2021, the website now publishes news that favors the right such as this
[Leftist Dem Taking Money From Tyrant](https://www.blabber.buzz/blab/pop/1028925-leftist-dem-taking-money-from-tyrant). This story is sourced from social media posts. In general, BlabberBuzz is far-right biased and promotes right-wing propaganda.
