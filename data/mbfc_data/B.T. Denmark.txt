Analysis / Bias
In review, B.T often covers crime stories with sensational headlines such as
[“29-year-old teacher admits having sex with two students”](https://www.bt.dk/udland/29-aarig-laerer-indroemmer-sex-med-to-elever) and Celebrity gossip with [extensive use of images](https://www.bt.dk/film-tv-og-streaming/kiloene-rasler-af-ex-on-the-beach-deltager). B.T also publishes political articles with emotionally loaded language, such as “ [Mette F.’s proposal is ‘totally unrealistic](https://www.bt.dk/krimi/mette-f.s-forslag-er-fuldstaendig-urealistisk),’” which is critical of the current government. Further, they publish equally critical articles about populist, right-wing Danish People’s Party (DPP) leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl, such as this: [“Kristian Thulesen Dahl loses credibility.”](https://www.bt.dk/politik/ny-maaling-kristian-thulesen-dahl-mister-trovaerdighed) On the issues, they frequently publish anti-immigration articles such as this: [“Immigrant inbreeding costs millions.” ](https://www.bt.dk/nyheder/indvandreres-indavl-koster-millioner)
Regarding sourcing, B.T. often hyperlinks to local sources such as tuttomercatoweb, videnskab.dk, jv.dk, and the Danish News Agency Ritzau,
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), and the Sequoyah County Times. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this article [“Trump breaks the law during a live broadcast”](https://www.bt.dk/udland/medie-trump-bryder-loven-under-live-transmission) and this: [The Supreme Court approves Trump’s contentious asylum restrictions](https://www.bt.dk/udland/hoejesteret-godkender-trumps-omstridte-asylbegraensninger). In general, B.T. publishes sensationalized stories with the occasional use of poor sources and a right-leaning editorial bias.
