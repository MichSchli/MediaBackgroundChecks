Analysis / Bias
Reference.com is an online encyclopedia that organizes content through a question-and-answer format. Articles are organized into hierarchical categories. An example entry into the encyclopedia is as follows:
[Understanding the History of Mexicoâ€™s Independence Day](https://www.reference.com/history-geography/history-mexican-independence-day). This entry, like all others, relies on credible sources like [National Geographic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-geographic/) and [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/). However, they also have questions and answers that appear to be product endorsements like this: [The Top Benefits of Buying GE Appliances](https://www.reference.com/world-view/top-benefits-ge-appliances). This page features ads for GE Products.
Editorially, they do not directly create opinion content; however, when covering political issues and events, more favor the left such as this
[LGBTQ+ History Month: Marsha P. Johnson & 12 Other Legendary Queer Activists](https://www.reference.com/history-geography/lgbtq-activists-who-shaped-american-history). In general, Reference.com serves as a reasonable encyclopedia for general information.
