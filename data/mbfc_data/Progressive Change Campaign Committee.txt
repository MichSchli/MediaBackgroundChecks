Analysis / Bias
In review, The Progressive Change Campaign Committee website does not report news; however, they list the issues they support, such as
[GREEN NEW DEAL](https://www.boldprogressives.org/issues/green-new-deal/). They also list the candidates they support and provide a donation link to that candidate. Some [prominent candidates](https://www.boldprogressives.org/candidates/) they support are Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ilhan Omar. Finally, they offer a bulleted list of the issues they support:
- Expanding Social Security
- Debt-free college and student debt cancellation
- Medicare for All
- Wall Street reform and accountability
- Stopping surveillance and protecting privacy
- Stopping bad trade deals like TPP
- Free and open Internet
- Paid family leave
PCCC runs political campaign ads that have failed fact checks.
