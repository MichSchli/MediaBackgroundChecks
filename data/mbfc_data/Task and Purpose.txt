Analysis / Bias
Task and Purpose publish original news and commentary on military-related subjects. Most writers are veterans or active-duty military personnel. News articles and headlines are fact-based and usually do not utilize highly emotional wording, such as this
[Marine Corps fires commander and sergeant major of Hawaii infantry battalion](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/3rd-battalion-3rd-marine-regiment-commander-sgt-maj-fired/). The website also republished articles from [Military.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-com/) and commentary from political figures like Barack Obama. Articles rely on credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Task and Purpose also publish satirical articles such as this
[Matt and the no good, very bad ‘woke’ military: A picture story](https://taskandpurpose.com/mandatory-fun/matt-gaetz-woke-military-picture-story/). Satire stories are appropriately tagged as “Humor” or “Mandatory Fun.” A review of humor content reveals that most are critical of the right.
Editorially, opinion content is usually properly labeled and favors the left, such as this
[A general’s explanation of ‘critical military theory’ is short on substance and dead wrong on diversity](https://taskandpurpose.com/opinion/critical-military-theory-response/). We also found criticism of Democratic President Joe Biden [How US military veterans navigated Biden’s ‘betrayal’ of Afghanistan](https://taskandpurpose.com/opinion/afghanistan-betrayal-biden/). While news reporting is usually straightforward, we also found strong opinions in news articles, such as this [Retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West embarrasses himself in a one-man push-up contest](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/us-army-allen-west-push-ups/). In general, news reporting is fact-based; however, opinion pieces favor a liberal perspective and opinionated news content is not always labeled properly.
