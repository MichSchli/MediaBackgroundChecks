Analysis / Bias
Red Right Patriot does not perform original news reporting. A typical story takes a quote from another story and then summarizes and adds opinions around the quotes. Most headlines are highly emotional such as this
[Trump Issues HEAVY Response to J6 Subpoena](https://redrightpatriot.com/trump-issues-heavy-response-to-j6-subpoena/).
Editorially most stories favor the right through story selection and often promote former President Trump, such as this
[Donald Trump Issues Mighty Signal to QAnon Followers.](https://redrightpatriot.com/donald-trump-issues-mighty-signal-to-qanon-followers/) They also report misinformation regarding covid-19 vaccines, such as this [Boosted Americans More Likely to Catch COVID and Doctors are STUMPED](https://redrightpatriot.com/boosted-americans-more-likely-to-catch-covid-and-doctors-are-stumped/). This is [not true.](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/scicheck-vaccinated-people-not-more-susceptible-to-covid-19-than-unvaccinated/)
Red Right Patriot is right-biased based on story selection and usually does not provide hyperlinked sourcing. Unfortunately, the complete lack of transparency lowers their credibility and renders them Mixed for factual reporting and questionable.
