[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). They report local news through the use of journalists with minimal bias using neutral headlines such as [Local filmmaker set to premiere movie in August](https://www.couriernews.com/news/local-filmmaker-set-to-premiere-movie-in-august/article_b83fe6ad-6ed0-552e-87b5-399748839eac.html).
