Analysis / Bias
In review, the website publishes podcasts and financial news geared toward the average investor. Articles and headlines sometimes use emotional/sensational wording such as this
[Retirees Have Shockingly Little Retirement Savings, Data Shows](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2020/09/06/retirees-have-shockingly-little-retirement-savings/). This story is properly sourced. Besides news and investment advice, the website also provides a wealth of [data and analysis](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/) on the financial markets.
Editorially, The Motley Fool reports on politics only when it pertains to the economy. A review of articles indicates that they do not always have a favorable view of former President Trump’s policy, such as this
[Trump Could Kill Social Security in 2.5 Years With This Proposal](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2020/09/04/trump-could-kill-social-security-in-25-years-with/). However, when reporting on Democratic President Joe Biden, they use a more neutral tone such as this: [12 Tax Changes Joe Biden Wants to Make](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2020/08/23/12-tax-changes-joe-biden-wants-to-make/). In general, the news is factual with a slight left-leaning bias, as evidenced by the negative language used to describe the former Republican President’s Policy.
