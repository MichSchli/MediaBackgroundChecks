Analysis / Bias
In review, The Times Herald poorly sources their opinion pieces. They publish articles with emotionally loaded language such as: “
[Trump right to impose tariffs on flood of steel imports](https://www.thetimesherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/03/05/trump-right-impose-tariffs-flood-steel-imports/111104054/).” Most opinion pieces favor the right such as: [“After a year of Trump, Democrats are delusional](https://www.thetimesherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/01/22/year-trump-democrats-delusional/109702714/),” “ [Beltway media needs to take a deep breath. Fake Trump stories hurt you.”](https://www.thetimesherald.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2017/12/19/beltway-media-needs-take-deep-breath-fake-trump-stories-hurt-you-jon-gabriel-column/959639001/) However, they present the opposite view: “ [I wish I had faith in President – Trump makes it impossible.”](https://www.thetimesherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/02/04/wish-faith-president-trump-makes-impossible/97444350/) In total, more opinion pieces favor the right. Local news reporting is usually well-sourced, and many news items are syndicated from the High factual [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/).
