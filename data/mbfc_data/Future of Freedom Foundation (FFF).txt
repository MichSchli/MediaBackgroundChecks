Funded by / Ownership
The Future of Freedom Foundation is a
[501(c)(3) organization](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/742543375) primarily funded through donations. The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose donors. An online store that sells books also generates revenue for the organization.
Analysis / Bias
The Future of Freedom Foundation (FFF) publishes books, a monthly journal, and op-eds published in numerous newspapers and on the website. Articles and headlines often do not contain loaded emotional language; however, they do reflect a conservative/libertarian perspective such as this
[My Case against Minimum-Wage Laws](https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/my-case-against-minimum-wage-laws/). While this article is well written and presents facts, it does not link to the sources of information it is presenting.
Editorially, the FFF holds biases in favor of free-market and Austrian Economics; however, they also hold the more left-leaning libertarian position on drug legalization
[Libertarians and the Drug War](https://www.fff.org/2021/06/22/libertarians-and-the-drug-war/). When reporting on climate change, they often link directly to other sources and authors who do not support science consensus. For example, this article [Is the Man-Made Climate Change Debate Really Over?](https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/freedom-on-the-web-link/is-the-man-made-climate-change-debate-really-over/), links directly to the [Climate Change Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-change-dispatch/), which MBFC rates as a quackery level pseudoscience website based on a complete rejection of the consensus of science regarding human-influenced climate change.
During 2020, they linked to questionable sources such as the
[Ron Paul Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-ron-paul-institute/), promoting [anti-mask propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) such as this [When Fascism Comes, It Will Be Wearing a Mask](https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/freedom-on-the-web-link/when-fascism-comes-it-will-be-wearing-a-mask/). In general, they promote free-market libertarianism and utilize poor sources or techniques that do not align with the consensus of science on some issues.
