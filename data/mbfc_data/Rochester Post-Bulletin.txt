Analysis / Bias
In review, the Post-Bulletin covers local news through reporters with minimal bias, such as this
[Female found shot dead in vehicle in St. Paul](https://www.postbulletin.com/news/crime-and-courts/6520293-Female-found-shot-dead-in-vehicle-in-St.-Paul). National and international news is republished through the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and other Forum Communications newspapers.
Editorially, the Forum Communications editorial board has always endorsed Republican candidates; however, in 2016, they chose not to endorse either candidate:
[“Presidential Endorsement: This time for president, none of the above](https://www.wctrib.com/opinion/editorials/4143017-presidential-endorsement-time-president-none-above).” However, the Post-Bulletin endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama in 2012, which was before Forum Communications bought the paper in 2019. All forum papers we have reviewed tend to hold a right-leaning editorial bias. In general, they report news factually with a right-leaning editorial bias.
