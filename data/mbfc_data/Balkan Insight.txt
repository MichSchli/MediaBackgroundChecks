Analysis / Bias
In review, when covering USA news, Balkan Insight frequently uses strong loaded emotional language in headlines such as this:
[“Trump’s Insult to Montenegro Won’t Shatter NATO’s Credibility.”](https://balkaninsight.com/2018/07/20/trump-s-insult-to-montenegro-won-t-shatter-nato-s-credibility-07-20-2018/) When it comes to news from different Balkan countries, they also use strong emotionally loaded language [“Kosovo’s Erratic Foreign Policy is Alienating its Allies,”](https://balkaninsight.com/2019/03/18/kosovos-erratic-foreign-policy-is-alienating-its-allies/) [“Croatia, Albania Complain of Serbia’s Nationalism to NATO](https://balkaninsight.com/2017/02/16/croatia-albania-complain-to-nato-for-serbia-s-nationalism-02-16-2017/),” and [“Hungary’s Foreign Minister: ‘We’re an Anti-Migration Country.’”](https://balkaninsight.com/2018/06/25/hungary-s-foreign-minister-we-re-an-anti-migration-country-06-22-2018/) In general, Balkan Insights utilizes local sources or local journalists, which we can not verify as credible; however, they also utilize credible sources such as [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/). A review of story selection indicates that most stories lean left in wording and topic selection.
Editorially, the director and founder of BIRN,
[Gordana Igric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Insight), has [criticized](https://www.dw.com/en/journalists-are-enemies-of-the-state-in-the-western-balkans/a-36622746) Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic because of his smear campaigns against a free press. President Vucic is a populist conservative [Serbian Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Progressive_Party) member and has been described as [authoritarian and hostile to media criticism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87)
