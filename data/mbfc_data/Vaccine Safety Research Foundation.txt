History
The Vaccine Safety Research Foundation (VSRF) is a website that
[claims](https://www.vacsafety.org/about-us/) to focus on vaccine safety, especially in relation to Covid-19 vaccines. While the site does feature interviews and articles that purport to be from medical professionals, it has been known to advance misleading claims. The content includes discussions on vaccine injuries and other vaccine-related topics, but it does not consistently rely on credible medical expertise.

Analysis / Bias
Upon review, VSRF offers articles and interviews that claim to address vaccine safety but frequently challenge the established medical consensus. The website hosts content discussing topics like “Covid-19 vaccine injuries we were never told about” and delves into issues such as “the consent crisis, the missing Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet on FDA’s website, and anaphylaxis associated with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) compound and Covid-19.”
The site’s roster of experts includes figures like
[Robert Malone](https://healthfeedback.org/authors/robert-malone/) and [Peter McCullough, MD](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Peter%20McCullough), who are known for promoting misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Additionally, VSRF has disseminated false claims, such as the conspiracy theory that [Covid-19 is a bioweapon](https://www.vacsafety.org/episode-76-whose-military-made-covid/) and the pseudoscientific assertion that [SV40 is increasing cancer rates](https://www.vacsafety.org/cancer-virus-found-in-covid-19-vaccine/). These claims have been refuted by credible sources, as seen in this [Health Feedback fact-check](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/claim-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-dna-contaminants-study-unknown-provenance-no-evidence-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-alter-dna-people/).
Given its tendency to question vaccine safety and credible medical advice, the website leans heavily towards pseudoscience and vaccine misinformation. It fails to offer a balanced perspective on vaccine safety and efficacy, raising significant concerns about its credibility.
