[While CUF does not disclose its donors](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/the-center-for-union-facts-cuf/#:~:text=Richard%20%E2%80%9CRick%E2%80%9D%20Berman%20is%20the,the%20Center%20for%20Union%20Facts.), according to [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/), tax filings confirm donations from the conservative Mercer Family Foundation ($150,000 in 2017), the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation ($125,000 in 2015), and the National Philanthropic Trust ($100,000 in 2017).
Analysis / Bias
The Center for Union Facts exhibits a clear bias against labor unions. The website’s content and campaigns consistently portray unions in a negative light, focusing on issues such as the decline in union membership, alleged corruption, and opposition to union-backed legislation. CUF’s advertisements have been criticized for using actors to depict union members and leaders negatively.
News stories on the website lead to a different website called LaborPains.org, which has the tagline “Because being in a union can be painful.” Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded language that portrays unions negatively, such as this
[SEIU Affiliate Workers United Defends Terrorism](https://laborpains.org/2023/10/12/seiu-affiliate-defends-terrorism/). This story is primarily sourced from social media.
Editorially, most stories view unions negatively, as evidenced by the organization’s advocacy for the
[Employee Rights Act](https://www.unionfacts.com/article/employee-rights/) and opposition to the [Employee Free Choice Act](https://www.unionfacts.com/article/public-opinion/), which further demonstrates its anti-union bias. In general, the content on CUF is mostly fact-based; however, there is significant bias in favor of corporations and opposition to unions, indicating a right-leaning political bias.
