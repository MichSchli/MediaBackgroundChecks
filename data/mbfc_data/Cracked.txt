Analysis / Bias
In review, The site functions as a “virtual writer’s room,” where over 2,500 amateurs pitch articles to which other users provide feedback. O’Brien and five other editors pick and refine the best material. The website also frequently provides listicles such as
[15 Surprising Stories Behind The Creation Of Famous Movies & Books](https://www.cracked.com/pictofacts-2056-15-surprising-stories-behind-creation-famous-movies-books/).
Cracked is difficult to define as some content is humorous and might classify as satire, while other stories are serious, though usually weird. However, when reporting on politics, they tend to have a left-leaning bias, though it is generally satirical such as this
[5 Embarrassing Secrets Hiding In Trump’s Cabinet](https://www.cracked.com/blog/5-weird-quirks-trumps-cabinet-picks-dont-want-you-to-know/). In general, Cracked is a hybrid site that combines fact with humor and satire; therefore, we will label them a left-leaning satire website.
