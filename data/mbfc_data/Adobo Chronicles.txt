Analysis / Bias
In review, the Adobo Chronicles is a satire website, as disclosed on each website page. For example, they have a medal showing a top 50 satire blog. They also have a tagline that reads “your best source of up-to-date unbelievable news.” Satire reviews are not in-depth. Our goal is to show that they properly disclaim they are satire. This source meets the criteria.
