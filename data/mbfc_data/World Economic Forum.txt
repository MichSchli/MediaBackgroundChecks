Analysis / Bias
The World Economic Forum website features information about their agenda, initiatives, and events. The website also features articles from a globalist perspective endorsing healthcare protections and concerns for climate change.
WEF’s website generally produces quality, in-depth reports and initiatives related to global economic reform. All information is well-sourced, factual, and presented with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Climate refugee – the world’s forgotten victims.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/climate-refugees-the-world-s-forgotten-victims/)
Editorially, WEF leans moderately left with its advocacy for global universal healthcare and environmental issues such as climate change. Further, when covering USA policies, they tend to favor the progressive left with stories like this:
[Why Juneteenth matters everywhere in the world](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/why-juneteenth-matters-everywhere/). In conclusion, the WEF is factual in reporting and holds a moderate liberal/progressive perspective.
