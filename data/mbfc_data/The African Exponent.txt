Analysis / Bias
In review, The African Exponent uses emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“The New President of Tanzania, John Magufuli, Wins Hearts of Tanzanians and Africans.”](https://www.africanexponent.com/post/president-john-pombe-magufuli-wins-hearts-of-tanzanians-2068) John Magufuli is the president of Tanzania and chairman of [CCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_Cha_Mapinduzi) (Chama Cha Mapinduzi – social democratic party), with the article heavily favoring him.
Although The African Exponent occasionally sources properly, most articles are poorly sourced, and only the image credit is given. Further, they regularly rewrite and republish the articles, such as “
[With $100 Million, This Is How Kenya Is Constructing Africa’s Largest AIDS Drug Factory”](https://www.africanexponent.com/post/10077-kenya-wants-to-improve-the-state-of-its-healthcare). This same story appears in [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) under the title [“Kenya steps up Aids battle as building starts on $100m drug factory”](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/28/kenya-aids-building-starts-100m-drug-factory). Lastly, they publish sensationalized stories without sourcing, such as this: [I Thought I Was Having Sex With My Housekeeper, I Didn’t Know He Was My Son…](https://www.africanexponent.com/bpost/4969-this-is-a-true-confesion-of-a-married-woman-somewhere-in-lagos-nigeria)
