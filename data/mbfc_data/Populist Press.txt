History
[Founded in October 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/populist.press), Populist Press is a website that looks like the [Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/). In fact, in bold red, they state at the top of the page, “ANNOUNCEMENT: Big Tech Hates us; we don’t use social media, so they can’t censor us. PLEASE bookmark us, visit daily and email our page to all your friends. SINCE DRUDGE SOLD OUT TO “CHYNA” …WE ARE THE NEW DRUDGE!”
Unlike the Drudge Report, they curate/aggregate news with a strong conservative bias and lack transparency as they do not disclose editors, authors, or ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Populist Press is an imposter website that attempts to look and behave like the Drudge Report, with a much stronger conservative bias. Populist.Press curates and aggregates news from a variety of mostly conservative, conspiracy, and questionable sources. Some sources we found used are
[Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/) (Questionable), [Frontpage Mag](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontpage-magazine/) (Questionable), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) (Questionable), and [NewsMax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/) (Questionable). Further, they also link to Steve Bannon’s War Room, frequently spreading disinformation regarding Coronavirus, with Bannon even [declaring](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/nyregion/bannon-lawyer-beheading.html) he wants to see Anthony Fauci beheaded. This resulted in his ban from Twitter.
Although Populist Press does not produce original content, it can be stated that they editorially align with the far-right based on story selection that always favors the right. Finally, during the Presidential Election of 2020, they have consistently republished election fraud misinformation. In general, the sources utilized by Populist Press are mixed factual at best and almost always right biased or questionable.
