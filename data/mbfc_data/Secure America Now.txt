Analysis / Bias
In review, Secure America Now has a section called “Projects.” One of the projects is an interactive game called
[MadLibs](https://themadlibs.com/) (Mad Liberals), where you fill in the blanks like the real game, except all of them are meant to be derogatory toward liberals. Other projects include “Guess Which Democrat” and others meant to denigrate the left. Another section is called “Our Focus,” in which you can sign petitions for the following: Support Our Ally Israel, Support Our Police Officers, Support Building the Wall, Oppose Radical Islamic Terrorism, Support Maximum Sanctions on Iran, Oppose the Impeachment Hoax, among other right-leaning causes.
The website also has a blog section that produces news and commentary with a far-right bias that is often denigrating toward Democrats, such as this
