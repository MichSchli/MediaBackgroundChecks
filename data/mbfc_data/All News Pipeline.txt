Analysis / Bias
The articles reviewed today from their news section reveal a severe distrust of mainstream media. In fact, most articles reference MSM as being fake news. This is ironic as ANP has false claims, as indicated by
[Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/fema-warns-mega-natural-disaster/). ANP also has a category called Alternative News that publishes [tin foil hat conspiracies](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/All_News_Pipeline). This source has it all: extreme right bias, propaganda, poorly sourced, and heavy on conspiracy theories. In general, All News Pipeline publishes strongly right-biased news that is not always factual.
