Analysis / Bias
In review, the Nature Conservancy is currently known for its plant a billion trees campaign, with the ambition to remove 10 million tons of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of removing 2 million cars by 2025. The Nature Conservancy has also
[faced criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/science/group-earns-oil-income-despite-pledge-on-drilling.html) for being to close to the fossil fuel industry and having a [board of directors](https://www.nature.org/about-us/governance/board-of-directors/board-of-directors-member-profiles.xml?redirect=https-301#Gleberman) that come from major corporations.
From a bias standpoint, the Nature Conservancy does not use loaded words and is scientifically evidence-based. According to
[Open Secrets,](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/all_summary.php?id=D000036134&nid=9195) the Nature Conservancy donates the majority of its money to Democratic candidates. Although the Nature Conservancy has faced criticism for connections to large corporations, the mission is pro-environment and therefore left-leaning, though still rooted in capitalism.
