Analysis / Bias
We will break this source down using our criteria. First, we look at wording and headlines. With these, the Conservative Firing Line heavily uses emotionally loaded words that are pro-right and anti-left. An example of a highly biased headline is as follows:
[Kid Rock triggers liberal snowflakes with true statement about life and hard work…](http://conservativefiringline.com/kid-rock-triggers-liberal-snowflakes-true-statement-life-hard-work/) Using the words “triggers liberal snowflakes” is about as extreme as you can get using loaded words to sway readers emotionally.
Next, we look at sourcing and factual reporting. In this area, the Conservative Firing Line manages to source their information. However, there are many cases when they source from far-right media sources or other questionable sources, such as
[Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/uncle-sams-misguided-children/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which has a poor track record with fact checkers.
We also found evidence of CFL publishing unproven conspiracies such as the
[Clinton’s murdering multiple people](http://conservativefiringline.com/seth-richs-murder-obamaclinton-cartels-body-count-mysterious-deaths-threats-dropping-like-flies/). Within this article about the Clintons, they source numerous questionable and conspiracy websites.
They also frequently publish false information about Covid-19:
