Analysis / Bias
Ballot-Access News provides in-depth analysis and reporting on ballot access and election laws, including legal challenges, reform efforts, and third-party/independent candidates. The website is run by
[Richard Winger](https://www.wfae.org/politics/2022-09-15/north-carolina-has-an-amazing-history-of-going-back-and-forth-with-third-parties), a longtime advocate for ballot access reform, which may lead to bias, but it generally provides accurate and factual reporting.
The website publishes summary articles with neutral headlines, such as
[“California Bill to Make Public Funding of Campaigns Possible.”](https://ballot-access.org/2023/03/27/california-bill-to-make-public-funding-of-campaigns-possible/) In this article, they publish a summary of the California bill; however, it does not provide any links. We have determined the article to be accurate as [SB 24 is a sponsored Bill](https://www.billtrack50.com/legislatordetail/23491), but it requires the reader to seek the information, which is considered poor sourcing by our methodology. In other stories, we found hyperlinked sourcing from credible outlets such as [Mississippi Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mississippi-today-bias/), [MinnPost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/minnpost/), and court dockets. Ballot-Access News also publishes in [print format](https://ballot-access.org/2023/03/23/march-2023-ballot-access-news-print-edition/). In general, Ballot-Access News is fact-based, reasonably sourced, and low-biased in reporting.
