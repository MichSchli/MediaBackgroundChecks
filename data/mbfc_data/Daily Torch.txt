History
Founded in 2017, The Daily Torch is a libertarian-leaning website and news source. According to their
[about page](http://dailytorch.com/about/), “The Daily Torch is the featured publication of [Americans for Limited Government](http://getliberty.org/), with opinion-based content dating back through 2008, dedicated to reducing the size and scope of government and maximizing individual freedom.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Daily Torch is reasonably transparent as they disclose on each page they are owned by
[AMERICANS FOR LIMITED GOVERNMENT](https://getliberty.org/), which is a conservative 501(c)(4) non-profit organization “dedicated to restoring the constitutional, limited powers of government at the federal, state, and local level… by fighting to reduce the size and scope of government, protecting individuals rights, promoting federalism, and rolling back the tyranny of the administrative state.” ALG is focused on “fiscal responsibility, regulatory reform, transparency and shedding light on overlooked issues that impact people’s lives.” Advertising and individual donations generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Torch publishes original reporting that is often free-market right biased and factual such as this
[Can pro-NAFTA, pro-PNTR w/ China Joe Biden win in Michigan?](http://dailytorch.com/2020/03/can-pro-nafta-pro-pntr-w-china-joe-biden-win-in-michigan/) Like all those reviewed, this story was properly sourced to credible or mostly factual media.
When it comes to science, they do not deny human-influenced climate change, but they do reject government intervention to solve the problem. We do not criticize sources for their solutions as this source supports the consensus of science as to the cause but has a differing opinion on how to solve a scientific problem.
