Analysis / Bias
In review, national news is covered through journalists with minimal loaded words such as this “
[Mary Lou McDonald: I’d call for election if not for pandemic,”](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40055747.html) and they rarely hyperlink. For example, the story above is sourced heavily through quotes. Politically, The Irish Examiner favors social liberal causes such as this: [“The green boom: How sustainability became big business for Irish brands.”](https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/healthandwellbeing/arid-40284104.html) However, they are also critical of the Left, where they criticize left parties [“The rise and fall — and Rise — of the Left in Ireland.”](https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/arid-30954303.html)
International news occasionally uses loaded words, sometimes directed at President Biden, such as in this article titled
[“Irish Examiner view: Joe Biden fails to match action with his talk of ancestral homeland.”](https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-40282688.html) A quote from the article reads, “What is most troubling is the lack of a US ambassador in Dublin and a US special envoy to Northern Ireland to give American advice on the peace process.” In general, The Irish Examiner holds a left-leaning editorial bias and is factual in reporting as they use sources such as the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/).
