Analysis / Bias
In review, Second Nexus reports news with a progressive left bias that utilizes moderately loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles such as this:
[READ: Alan Cross Tweets ‘Falwell’s Clearly Articulated ‘Two Kingdoms’ Theology [I]s the SAME Approach German Lutherans Took as Hitler Rose to Power’](https://secondnexus.com/news/alan-cross-jerry-falwell-hitler/) and [George W. Bush: Trump ‘Sorta Makes Me Look Pretty Good’.](https://secondnexus.com/news/george-bush-donald-trump-administration/) Many articles on Second Nexus source tweets and then provides opinionated commentary about the statements. When sourcing to other information they typically use credible sources such as the [World Health Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/) and [National Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-journal/). Editorially, most opinions come from a left perspective with support for the Environment, LGBT rights, and anti-conservative issues. In general, story selection almost always favors the left and sometimes is not factual.
