Analysis / Bias
In review, the website does not publish news. It simply provides information about the organization and its policy stances, which are always right-leaning. Although they do not publish news on their website, they make political claims through social media and media. They also have a
[separate website](https://www.turningpoint.news/) that publishes right-wing biased news that is generally well-sourced and uses minimal loaded words, but story selection always favors the right.
