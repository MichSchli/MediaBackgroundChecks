Analysis / Bias
The owner of Jang Group of Newspapers, which includes Geo TV, Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman,
[has been critical of the government](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-television-media-arrests-tax-evasion-bd3de999a9d5501a85016a8e81fdd68d), and in 2020, he was arrested. As a result, press freedom has a significant limitation as criticism of the government has consequences.
In review, The News International reports national news with minimally emotionally loaded headlines:
[Pakistan receives more coronavirus vaccine doses from Pfizer, Sinopharm. ](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/867297-pakistan-receives-more-vaccine-doses-from-pfizer-sinopharm)The wording of the articles is also relatively neutral. The News International publishes articles covering the opposition party with emotionally loaded headlines such as [Foreign currency ‘rain’ down during PPP US chapter president’s festive return to hometown](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/786499-foreign-currency-notes-rain-down-on-ppp-us-presidents-festive-return-to-hometown). They typically source information from themselves or their sister publication, [GEO TV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geo-tv-pakistan/). The News International reports international news sourcing through large quotes; however, they do not provide [hyperlinking](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/867038-asia-witnesses-re-surge-in-covid-infections-as-delta-unsettles-world).
Editorially, they have little choice other than to favor the right-leaning government of Pakistan, such as this
[‘I share your pain’: PM Imran Khan meets Hazara mourners in Quetta](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/771752-i-share-your-pain-pm-imran-khan-meets-hazara-mourners-in-quetta). In general, the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning bias; however, there is little hyperlinked sourcing to verify the information.
