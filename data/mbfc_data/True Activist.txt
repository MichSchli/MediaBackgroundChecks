History
[Founded in 2011](http://whois.domaintools.com/trueactivist.com), True Activist is a news and opinion website that republishes articles from other sources, often with a liberal perspective. The website offers the tagline “Exposing the truth one lie at a time,” but completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page or disclose ownership or author names.

Analysis / Bias
In review, True Activist mainly publishes positive stories from other sources or pseudoscience; however, they often don’t credit these sources, making it difficult to determine if the stories are factual. Headlines and wording are often sensationalized:
[UK Accidentally Admits Use Of Horrifying, Organ Rupturing Weapons In Syria](http://www.trueactivist.com/uk-accidentally-admits-use-of-horrifying-organ-rupturing-weapons-in-syria/). This story is sourced to the conspiracy/pseudoscience website [The Mind Unleashed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-mind-unleashed/). Politically, True Activist does not have a favorable view of President Trump, as evidenced by this article: [Scientists Are Being Demoted By Trump Administration For Studying Climate Change](http://www.trueactivist.com/scientists-are-being-demoted-by-trump-administration-for-studying-climate-change/?s=climate+change).
When it comes to science, True Activists support the consensus on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but do not when it comes to [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), as they often promote [anti-GMO propaganda](http://www.trueactivist.com/?s=gmo). They also promote [anti-vaccine propaganda](http://www.trueactivist.com/not-just-austim-major-yale-study-shows-vaccines-tied-to-multiple-brain-disorders/?s=vaccines) as well as [chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/).
