In review, The Welland Tribune uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Niagara businesses already benefiting from $3.6-billion build of new hospital](https://www.wellandtribune.ca/news/niagara-region/niagara-businesses-already-benefiting-from-3-6-billion-build-of-new-hospital/article_cf6661e8-b208-51a7-ae0b-e203a6209a19.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
