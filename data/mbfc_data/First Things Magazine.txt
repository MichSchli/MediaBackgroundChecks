Analysis / Bias
In review, First Things is a Neoconservative magazine and website that has a right-wing bias in reporting. There is the moderate use of loaded words in both headlines and articles, such as this:
[ROY MOORE’S RIDICULOUS DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2017/10/roy-moores-ridiculous-defense-of-marriage). Don’t let this headline fool you; it is actually in support of Moore’s anti-gay marriage stance. In general, First Things holds positions typical of the Christian right, such as [Pro-life](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2017/03/pro-life-pro-truth) and [negative toward Islam](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2013/06/no-the-god-of-the-quran-is-not-the-god-of-the-bible). Most articles are appropriately sourced; however, they sometimes use Questionable sources such as [Life Site News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/), which has an extreme right-wing bias in opposition to gay marriage and abortion.
