Analysis / Bias
In review, Viral Thread publishes a variety of stories on many different topics. They really don’t publish much about politics, so there really isn’t any bias to determine. Since they pick such a wide range of stories there does not appear to be any bias there either. They are simply publishing popular stories. The only criticism of this website is that they sometimes source
[questionable science sources](http://www.viralthread.com/new-study-reveals-that-drinking-regularly-reduces-diabetes-risk/?all) and other times [pseudoscience](http://www.viralthread.com/possessed-doll-bought-on-ebay-for-1100-reportedly-attacks-its-new-owner/?all). Other than that this is a low biased and mostly factual website. While some of the content is questionable there really isn’t any bias applied and not enough to place this source in the Conspiracy/Pseudoscience Category. I would suggest fact-checking articles on an individual basis from this source.
