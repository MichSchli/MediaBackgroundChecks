History
Founded in February 1998, according to its
[about page](https://www.memri.org/about), MEMRI or Middle East Media Research Institute states its purpose as distributing English translations of Middle Eastern media. MEMRI describes itself as “Independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit, 501(c)3 organization” and they state that they cover “original analysis of political, ideological, intellectual, social, cultural, and religious trends.”
MEMRI is based in Washington DC and its founder is a former Israeli military intelligence officer
[Yigal Carmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Carmon). Memri also launched MEMRI TV news channel which is described by [Know your Meme](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/know-your-meme/) as “the channel has gained much notoriety for its absurd translations of news programs, many of which have spawned photoshops of screenshots showing false or edited subtitles.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
According to
[Source Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/) [“Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) is a Israeli propaganda organization that selectively translates materials from the Arab/Muslim/Iranian press purportedly demonstrating hostility against Israel/Jews.”](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute)
In review, the articles on MEMRI are supposedly direct translations from other languages, however, almost all translation favor Israel and denigrate Muslims.
[According](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/28/israel2) to [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), MEMRI is a pro-Israel propaganda site. MEMRI frequently uses strongly emotional wording such as this: [Hamas Political Bureau Member Fathi Hammad Calls On Palestinians All Over The World To Slaughter Jews, Says: If Israel Doesn’t Lift The Siege By Next Friday, We Will Kill The Jews With Explosive Belts And Knives](https://www.memri.org/reports/hamas-political-bureau-member-fathi-hammad-calls-palestinians-all-over-world-slaughter-jews). Again, this story is relying on MEMRI’s translation, which we cannot verify. In general, MEMRI is a pro-Israeli propaganda source.
