Analysis
American Media Group (AMG-news.com) publishes right-leaning conspiracy and pseudoscience information. The website frequently makes outrageous claims not substantiated by evidence such as this
[GITMO: Which Presidents Are Going? Deep State, Treason, Military Tribunals, Official Documents, List of Indictments](https://amg-news.com/archives/12008). This article claims that high-level politicians such as Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George W. Bush, and several other perceived deep state politicians are rumored to be housed at Guantanamo Military Federal Prison. A quote from the article reads:
The internet has been buzzing with rumors that high-level VIP members of the Deep State (aka Cabal/Illuminati/Global Elite) are being detained for human rights abuses and corruption, and are being taken by U.S. Special Forces to military prison at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (Gitmo) as a result of thousands of sealed indictments. Multiple sources have been reporting on some of the key VIP figures taken there.
The multiple sources cited in the article appear to be fringe Youtube videos and conspiracy theorist
