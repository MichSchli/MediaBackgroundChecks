[Founded in 2004](http://whois.domaintools.com/moonbattery.com) by [Dave Blount](http://whois.domaintools.com/moonbattery.com), MoonBattery is a far-right conservative blog presumably written by Blount. The blog does not have an about page; however, according to the associated [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Moonbattery-150964594926416/about/?ref=page_internal), their mission is “Driving a stake through the heart of the lunatic left.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website consists of an opinion blog written by Dave Blount with extreme right-wing bias in reporting. Virtually, every post favors the right and denigrates the left. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Elizabeth Warren’s Most Egregious Lie](https://moonbattery.com/elizabeth-warrens-most-egregious-lie/). This story is sourced to The [Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/) and Liberty Daily. In another story, there is rejection on the consensus of global warming such as this: [Global Warming Lunacy Could Sink German Economy](https://moonbattery.com/global-warming-lunacy-could-sink-german-economy/). A quote from the post reads “It appears [increasingly unlikely](https://moonbattery.com/noaa-data-no-warming-in-usa-since-2005/) that human CO2 emissions are driving any perceptible fluctuation in the climate anyway.” This statement then links to the human-influenced climate denial website [Watts Up With That](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/watts-up-with-that/).
The website also lists their
[sites of interest](https://www.moonbattery.com/links/sites.html), which reads like a who’s who of right-wing extremism and Questionable sources. Here are a few sites they favor: [National Patriot](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-national-patriot/) (Questionable), [Pacific Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pacific-pundit/) (Questionable) and [VDare](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vdare/) (Questionable).
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=moonbattery&gsc.sort=) reveals a [failed fact check.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/time-traveling-hula-hooper-photograph/) However, MoonBattery has been exposed by “other” organizations for promoting conspiracy theories, xenophobia, and racism.
