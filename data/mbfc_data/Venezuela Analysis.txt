Analysis / Bias
Venezuela Analysis uses emotionally charged language, such as in their article “
[Hugo Chávez and the Last Solar Eclipse of the 20th Century,”](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/15719) to promote their left-wing bias in favor of the Bolivarian Revolution and its leader, Hugo Chávez. It employs nationalist propaganda, using the ideals of Simon Bolivar to exploit populist sentiments, particularly associated with the Bolivarian Revolution.
Many stories promote Socialist government propaganda and anti-American sentiments, including
[“Around the World in 60 Days: The Mexico Charade by a Desperate Washington.”](https://venezuelanalysis.com/around-world-60-days/15703) Additionally, they publish articles that present the current leader of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, positively, as seen in “ [Venezuela: Inflation Lowest in Decade as Credit Suisse Forecasts 20 Percent Growth”](http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/15499) and “ [Venezuela: Government Raises Wages as Inflation Hits Eight-Year Low](http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/15472).”
When it comes to sourcing, they use quotes and social media. Generally, reporting is one-sided, promoting the Maduro government and its platform while not properly sourcing information.
