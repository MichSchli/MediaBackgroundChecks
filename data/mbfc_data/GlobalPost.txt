Analysis / Bias
In review, the GlobalPost covers a wide range of original news with minimal use of loaded language such as this
[In Myanmar, underground poetry nights build bridges between Rohingya and Burmese writers](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-10-01/myanmar-underground-poetry-nights-build-bridges-between-rohingya-and-burmese). This story, like all others reviewed, is sourced to credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/). Editorially, most stories favor the left and take anti-authoritarian views, such as [Chinese reactions to Trump and Biden are mixed](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-09-29/chinese-reactions-trump-and-biden-are-mixed). Generally, the news is reported factually, with a left-leaning editorial bias.
