Analysis / Bias
The WLT Report publishes news that aligns with a conservative perspective with articles such as this
[COVID-19 Jab Mandate Reportedly Implemented at Medical School in Republican-Led State](https://wltreport.com/2023/09/30/covid-19-jab-mandate-reportedly-implemented-medical-school/). This article relies on many sources, including the Questionable [100% Fed Up](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/100-percent-fed-up/). In other articles, we found reliance on disreputable sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2021/04/17/daily-source-bias-check-infowars-alex-jones/), and [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and, in particular, former president
[Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as this [Does President Trump Look Worried To You](https://wltreport.com/2023/06/26/does-president-trump-look-worried-to-you/)? Further, they frequently denigrate the left, such as this [(WATCH) Joe Biden Creepily Walks Away Behind Closed Doors With Children of White House Visitor](https://wltreport.com/2023/05/19/watch-joe-biden-creepily-walks-away-behind-closed-doors-with-children-of-white-house-visitor/).
Finally, the WLT Report routinely floats conspiracy such as
[Joe Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) not being alive and using a body double: [Is Joe Biden Dead? Military Funeral In 2020?](https://wltreport.com/2023/09/21/is-joe-biden-dead-military-funeral-2020/) They also promote stolen election claims like this [AP: New Tapes Confirm Stolen Election](https://wltreport.com/2023/04/15/ap-new-tapes-confirm-stolen-election/) as well as debunked fears over the Covid-19 vaccine: [Vaccine Shedding Confirmed on FDA Insert, It’s Not COVID-19](https://wltreport.com/2023/08/22/vaccine-shedding-confirmed-fda-insert-its-not-covid/). Vaccine shedding is [scientifically impossible](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-covid19-shedding-idUSL2N2OB1OX). In general, this is a far-right biased website that frequently promotes disinformation.
