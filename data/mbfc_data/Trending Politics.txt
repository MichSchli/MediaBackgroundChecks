History
[Founded in 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/trendingpolitics.com), Trending Politics is a hyper-partisan conservative news and opinion website. They fully disclose their bias on the [about page](https://trendingpolitics.com/static/about.html) as follows: “We provide conservative commentary on the news stories of the day. Studies have shown that 90%+ of the stories about President Trump are negative, so we like to bring the other side of the story to you. With that being said, we aren’t shy to admit we’re biased. The majority of our articles will have a good amount of Pro-Trump opinion weaved into it.”
They do not disclose editors or ownership of the website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Trending Politics rarely publishes original reporting but rather offers commentary to news stories from other sources. Headlines and wording of articles often use emotionally loaded language such as this:
[House Democrats Sue Trump For Another Ridiculous Reason](https://trendingpolitics.com/house-democrats-sue-trump-for-another-ridiculous-reason/). This story is sourced from the Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), which has failed numerous fact checks. Regarding sourcing information, they use a combination of credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and poor sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Defiant America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/defiant-america/).
Editorially, story selection always favors the right and typically reports on President Trump positively:
[Don’t Impeach Trump. He Puts America, Not Ukraine, First](https://trendingpolitics.com/don-t-impeach-trump-he-puts-america-not-ukraine-first/) and negatively on liberals such as this, [Schiff Exposed After Report Reveals Disturbing Ties Within His Own Committee](https://trendingpolitics.com/schiff-exposed-after-report-reveals-disturbing-ties-within-his-own-committee/). Trending Politics also promotes conspiracy theories such as this: [Investigation Into Ilhan Omar Reveals Fraudulent Tax Returns Possibly Linked to Marriage to Her Brother](https://trendingpolitics.com/investigation-into-ilhan-omar-reveals-fraudulent-tax-returns-possibly-linked-to-marriage-to-her-brother/). Fact-checkers have determined that the claim she married her brother is [unproven](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/jul/18/did-ilhan-omar-marry-her-brother-her-hometown-news/) and hence a conspiracy theory at this point.
Finally, Trending Politics frequently publishes disinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. See failed fact checks below.
