Analysis / Bias
Men’s Health publishes short and long-form articles about men’s lifestyle, fitness, nutrition, fashion, and sexuality. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded wording, such as this
[Troy Aikman Shared the Workout and Diet That Keeps Him Ripped at 55.](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a39702320/troy-aikman-workout-and-diet-video/) All the articles reviewed were properly sourced from either peer-reviewed scientific information or credible media sources such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/).
Editorially, Men’s Health does not produce op-eds; however, they report on political issues when it relates to health that is negative toward the right such as this
[A New Study Links Donald Trump’s ‘Chinese Virus’ Tweet to Rise in Anti-Asian Hate Speech](https://www.menshealth.com/trending-news/a35873785/donald-trump-chinese-virus-tweet-anti-asian-hashtag-study/) and [I Helped Crush Trump’s Backward Trans Military Ban](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a35712297/i-helped-crush-trumps-backward-trans-military-ban/).
A study revealed that Men’s Health is not always reliable when it comes to science. The study published in the
[American Journal of Men’s Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7322823/) indicates that for “recommendations from Men’s Health, evidence supported approximately 23% of the 80 recommendations, while evidence was unclear, nonexistent, or contradictory for approximately 77% of the recommendations.” In other words, Men’s Health Magazine mildly promotes harmless pseudoscience usually related to diet and holds a left-leaning political bias.
