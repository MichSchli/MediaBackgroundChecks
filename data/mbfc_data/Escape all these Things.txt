History
Escape all these Things is a website run by Tim McHyde, a Fundamentalist Christian who claims to be an expert on end times biblical prophecy. According to the about page, “Since starting his first Bible prophecy website in 1999, Tim McHyde has written hundreds of articles and answered over 50,000 reader Bible questions. By following Jesus’ own literal interpretation approach to interpreting Scripture (John 10:35), he has explained hard, overlooked passages, such as the “
[Wormwood](https://escapeallthesethings.com/ninth-planet-prophecy)” mystery at the center of the Book of Revelation (Rev 8:11) and Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

In our previous review, the world was to end in 2026
[Why I’m Convinced The End Begins in 2026—And What You Can Do About It.](https://escapeallthesethings.com/2026-in-prophecy/) A search reveals that this may have changed to 2022 or 2024 [Mideast Nuclear War – New Insight Confirms 2022 and 2024?](https://escapeallthesethings.com/psalm-83-gospel-insight/) According to this [article](https://escapeallthesethings.com/2021-prophecies/), it seems like the can keeps getting kicked down the road. In other words, this is a fake Christian organization that plays on the gullible with the end of times and, when it doesn’t happen, rationalizes to the future to keep the donations flowing. This is a scam site. Period!
