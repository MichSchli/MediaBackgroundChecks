History
Code Pink: Women for Peace is an NGO that
[describes itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Pink) as a “grassroots peace and social justice movement working to end U.S.-funded wars and occupations, to challenge militarism globally, and to redirect our resources into health care, education, green jobs, and other life-affirming activities.”
According to their
[about page](http://www.codepink.org/about), Code Pink was founded by Medea Benjamin, Jodie Evans, Diane Wilson, Starhawk, and about 100 other women on November 17, 2002. They primarily organize various activities such as rallies, marches, and protests. One example is [“Woman Who Laughed At Jeff Sessions Could Face Jail Time This Week](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laughed-jeff-sessions-desiree-fairooz_us_5963a523e4b0615b9e9367cb).” They are known for their signature Pink Outfits and signs.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Code Pink presents news through a section on the website titled Hot Pink News. News reporting is often centered around anti-militarism and social justice. Headlines and articles often contain strongly loaded words that favor the left, such as
[Trump’s Fake Withdrawal From Endless War](https://www.codepink.org/trumps_fake_withdrawal_from_endless_war). This story is sourced from various sources, including Congress.gov, [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/), and [NBC News](https://www.codepink.org/trumps_fake_withdrawal_from_endless_war). Although Code Pink makes an effort to source information in their articles, they sometimes link to questionable [blogs](https://memoirsofdignity.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/awamiyah-under-lock-down-saudi-arabia-renews-its-purge-on-the-citizens-of-awamiyah-8-confirmed-dead/amp/) and sources such as [Russian Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), which has an abysmal track record with fact-checkers.
Code Pink often reports only one side of stories. For example, they oppose
[ Israel](https://www.codepink.org/justice_for_palestine) in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is a good position; however, they never mention that Hamas has performed acts of terror. It is irresponsible and misleading not to tell the whole story. In general, Code Pink is a far-left biased source that sometimes uses poor sources.
