Analysis / Bias
In review, Kotaku primarily covers video games and entertainment news; however, they occasionally cover politics related to video games, the internet, or entertainment. Kotaku uses minimal to moderately loaded headlines such as this:
[Trump Says Video Game Violence Is ‘Shaping Young People’s Thoughts’.](https://kotaku.com/trump-says-video-game-violence-is-shaping-young-peoples-1823238396) All information contained in articles is well-sourced to credible media outlets or sources. Story selection moderately [favors the left](https://kotaku.com/net-neutrality-overturned-1821296574).
