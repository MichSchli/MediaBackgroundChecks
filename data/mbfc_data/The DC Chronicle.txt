History
The DC Chronicle is a news and opinion website,
[founded in May 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/dc-chronicle.com), by [Michael Moates](https://dc-chronicle.com/moates/) who is Chairman of the [Narrative Times News Foundation](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-5387073), and [Carlton “Carl” Milo Higbie IV](https://dc-chronicle.com/carl-higbie/) who is a spokesman for the [Great America Super PAC](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/great-america-pac/), which advocated for the election of Donald Trump.
Funded by / Ownership
The DC Chronicle is owned by the Narrative Times-News Foundation, which is a not-for-profit 501(c)3. The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The DC Chronicle primarily republishes news from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and the strong right-leaning [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). Although they republish from credible low biased sources such as the Associated Press, they deceptively change the headline to reflect an emotional right-wing bias such as this: [A Make America Great Again Bomb Has Just Been Dropped On The House](https://dc-chronicle.com/2018/11/14/make-america-great-bomb-just-dropped-house/). Here is another example of a headline that does not match the tone of an AP story: [Trump Just Humiliated This Democrat In The Most Epic Way Possible](https://dc-chronicle.com/2018/11/14/trump-just-humiliated-democrat-epic-way-possible/). Further, Michael Moates shares the articles he writes for other sources. Some of these sources are on our [conspiracy](https://www.infowars.com/alyssa-milano-gets-loomered-confronted-over-ties-to-sharia-law-activist-linda-sarsour/) or [questionable list](https://dc-chronicle.com/moates/).
Editorially, the website does not clearly distinguish between news reporting and opinion pieces, however, all opinions expressed on this website are strongly right biased and heavily in favor of President Donald Trump and his policy.
Although a
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=dc-chronicle&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals that the DC Chronicle has not failed a fact check, Michael Moates has [failed a fact check](http://checkyourfact.com/2018/09/18/fact-check-kavanaugh-christine-ford-professor/).
