Analysis / Bias
In review, The Washington Institute provides news and analysis of Middle East relations through research. There is minimal use of loaded language in headlines and articles such as this:
[Why Has Netanyahu Reversed Course on Early Elections?](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/why-has-netanyahu-reversed-course-on-early-elections) This story also lacks any sourcing that supports the opinions presented. Overall, this article presents a pro-Netanyahu bias through this quote: “In sum, Netanyahu has outmaneuvered his rivals by going straight to the public.” When reviewing the broad content on this website, there is a clear pro-Israeli bias in story selection and wording.
The Washington Institute has faced criticism from others, such as
[Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/) in the article: [Who funds Muslim-baiting in the US?](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/08/201182713537929189.html) Which they claim that the Washington Institute has strong ties to the pro-Israel lobbying group [AIPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIPAC) and for being founded by a former AIPAC employee. In their book, [The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_US_Foreign_Policy) [,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_US_Foreign_Policy) [John Mearsheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mearsheimer), a University of Chicago political science professor, and [Stephen Walt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Walt), academic dean at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, describe it as “part of the core” of the pro-Israeli lobby in the United States.
