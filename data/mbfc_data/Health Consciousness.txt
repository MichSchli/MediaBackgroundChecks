Analysis / Bias
In review, Health Consciousness publishes a variety of health and nutrition news, most of which is either conspiratorial or pseudoscience. For example, in this article “
[ADHD is a FAKE Disease Invented by Big Pharma to Drug Children for Profit”](http://www.thehealthconsciousness.com/adhd-is-a-fake-disease-invented-by-big-pharma-to-drug-children-for-profit/) they make the claim that ADHD is not a real health issue. While they may argue that the diagnosis is overused, the claim of it being fake is [outright false](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html). Like most clickbait [pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) websites they promote [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and [miracle cancer cures](http://www.thehealthconsciousness.com/cancer-cures-doctor-will-not-tell/). Health Consciousness also utilizes very poor sources such as [Natural News.](http://www.thehealthconsciousness.com/study-proving-vaccines-cause-autism-banned-from-internet/)
