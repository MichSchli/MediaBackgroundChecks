Analysis / Bias
The United States government has accused
[Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) of operating four websites it says are [“spreading Russian propaganda.”](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-coronavirus-pandemic-health-moscow-media-ff4a56b7b08bcdc6adaf02313a85edd9) One of the websites mentioned in the article published by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) is Politnavigator.net. The website has denied the accusation, and the editor of PolitNavigator, [Sergey Stepanov](https://ua.linkedin.com/in/sergey-stepanov-3403b256), is quoted in the article as saying, “Washington turns a blind eye to what he says is Ukraine’s anti-democratic actions and instead labels those who point them out “anti-Ukrainian propagandists” and “agents of the FSB.” He adds that he would like to believe that American journalism will rise above the hysteria provoked by officials.
National Ukrainian media outlets and fact-checkers also describe PolitNavigator as an
[“anti-Ukrainian online media outlet”](https://imi.org.ua/en/news/anti-ukrainian-media-outlet-correspondent-arrested-in-vinnytsia-suspected-of-treason-i46708) that promotes [ disinformation.](https://www.veridica.ro/en/disinformation/disinformation-censorship-is-introduced-in-the-republic-of-moldova-by-banning-the-broadcasting-of-certain-categories-of-programs-from-russia)
Pro-Russian bias is evident in PolitNavigator’s coverage of Ukrainian politics and the conflict in eastern Ukraine. For example, PolitNavigator reports on a statement made by the Russian lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky, titled
[“People must understand: Ukraine is death, and Russia is life.”](https://www.politnavigator.net/lyudi-dolzhny-ponyat-ukraina-ehto-smert-a-rossiya-ehto-zhizn.html) The article suggests that Zhirinovsky’s statement reflects the narrative in Russia that portrays Ukraine as a failed state and promotes the idea of its integration into Russia.
Further, the website frequently publishes articles criticizing the Ukrainian government, NATO, and the
[United States](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/). For example, this article has a biased, emotionally loaded headline [“In Ukraine, they hope that the fallen drone will stimulate NATO to transfer aviation to Kyiv.”](https://www.politnavigator.net/na-ukraine-nadeyutsya-chto-upavshijj-bespilotnik-budet-stimulirovat-nato-peredat-kievu-aviaciyu.html) Furthermore, the article presents comments from Russian experts/ commentators who argue that the “US and NATO are engaging in provocative actions and that Russia should have stopped the flights of American drones over the Black Sea long ago.” The article promotes the Russian perspective on the incident and paints the US and NATO as aggressive and provocative actors in the region. Finally, this story is not sourced properly with hyperlinks.
Generally, PolitNavigator holds a right-leaning bias, frequently publishes Russian pro-government, anti-west propaganda, lacks transparency, and poorly sources information.
