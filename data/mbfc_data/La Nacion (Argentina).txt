[La Nación](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/cultura/bartolome-mitre-y-la-numismatica-a-201-anos-de-su-nacimiento-nid26062022/) is one of the major leading tabloid newspapers published in Argentina. La Nacion’s headquarter is based in Buenos Aires. Former President [Bartolomé Mitre](https://books.google.com/books?id=iywdDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1888&lpg=PA1888&dq=He+was+President+of+Argentina+from+1862+to+1868+and+the+first+president+of+unified+Argentina&source=bl&ots=qP5thjQRsE&sig=ACfU3U3XXF1-qYfelJTJpaHzD4W5WdU24A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHqNLrkLX6AhXXlWoFHTLZD4AQ6AF6BAgaEAM#v=onepage&q=He%20was%20President%20of%20Argentina%20from%201862%20to%201868%20and%20the%20first%20president%20of%20unified%20Argentina&f=false) was the founder of La Nación. La Nación’s main competitor is the [Clarin](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/clarin-bias/) newspaper. The paper primarily focuses on news and politics, entertainment, and sports. Since its inception, La Nación has promoted a conservative editorial line.

Analysis / Bias
[La Nacion](https://worldcrunch.com/partners/la-nacion-argentina/) is the leading [conservative](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18707517) newspaper of Argentina and is also known as the “opposition newspaper while the Kirchners were in power, from 2003 to 2015.” The [Left-leaning](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-62762421) Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (CFK), currently serving as the Vice President, was the president from 2007 to 2015.
In review, La Nacion appears to maintain its anti-Kirchner position through publishing articles with emotional wording such as
[“The card up the sleeve of Kirchnerism.”](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/la-carta-bajo-la-manga-del-kirchnerismo-nid25092022/) The article states, “Cristina Kirchner pretends to believe that she is the one who sets the strategic lines of the Government and blurred Alberto Fernández wants to believe that he still governs.”
However, most articles reviewed have a balanced tone, such as “
[The Government asked the companies and the union “good sense” to end the conflict that paralyzes the production of tires.”](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/el-gobierno-pidio-a-las-empresas-y-al-sindicato-sensatez-para-terminar-con-el-conflicto-que-paraliza-nid27092022/) This article concerns the long-running conflict between Argentina’s Single Union of Tire Workers (SUTNA) and tire manufacturing companies Bridgestone, Pirelli, and Fate. As mentioned in the article, Gabriela Cerruti serves as the official spokesperson for (Center-Left) President [Alberto Angel Fernandez](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/argentina-government-and-media-profile/).
In another article reporting about right-center former president Macri “
[In his new book, Mauricio Macri does not confirm if he will be a candidate for president in 2023: “In Argentina, everything changes too”](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/seguridad/mauricio-macri-no-confirma-si-sera-candidato-a-presidente-en-2023-pero-en-la-argentina-todo-cambia-nid25092022/) the body of both articles is balanced and neutral in tone.
Regarding sourcing, La Nacion reports through journalists using direct quotes and credible sources. La Nacion also relies on credible news agencies for international news, such as
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Finally, editorially, more stories favor the right such as this [A government (Center-left) against the citizenry](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/editoriales/un-gobierno-a-contramano-de-la-ciudadania-nid21092022/). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
