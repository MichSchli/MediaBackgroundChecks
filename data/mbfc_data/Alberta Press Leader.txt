Analysis / Bias
In review, the Alberta Press Leader has a name that leads one to believe they are a credible newspaper. This is not the case. The website is a conservative blog that promotes a right-leaning perspective such as this
[Alberta Premier asked to release jailed pastor, end religious persecution](https://albertapressleader.ca/?p=32365). Articles are reasonably sourced from credible outlets, and local news reporting is factual.
Editorially, they align with the right through minimizing climate change
[Professor writes critical ‘Open Letter’ to teen climate activist Greta Thunberg](https://albertapressleader.ca/?p=12074) as well as promoting anti-lockdown measures for Covid-19 [Will we recover the freedoms we surrender to the fight against COVID-19?](https://albertapressleader.ca/?p=19637). Further, they frequently report negatively on [PM Justin Trudeau](https://albertapressleader.ca/?p=19637) and during the 2020 US Presidential election promoted election fraud narratives [POLL: Was the U.S. presidential election ‘rigged’?](https://albertapressleader.ca/?p=28191). In general, the news is reported mostly factually and with a strong right-leaning conservative bias.
