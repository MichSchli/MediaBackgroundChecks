Analysis / Bias
During WW2, Aftonbladet’s
[political stance](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148405/aftonbladet) was far-right; however, after the 1956 trade unions’ acquisition, Aftonbladet’s political stance became social-democratic.
In review, Aftonbladet publishes national stories with neutral headlines such as
[“This is what happened in Sweden last night](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/6nR45Q/this-is-whats-happened-in-sweden-last-night),” [“Migrants’ values mapped out in a new study,”](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/9vp5yr/migranters-varderingar-kartlagda-i-ny-studie) and on issues such as equality [“Requirements for makeup for female staff at Norwegian.](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/mRKP5q/krav-pa-smink-for-kvinnlig-personal-hos-norwegian)” Aftonbladet reports world news with neutral headlines such as “ [Trump acknowledges Jerusalem and moves the embassy in Israel](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/gP7BM0/trump-erkanner-jerusalem-och-flyttar-ambassaden-i-israel).” Further, they also publish typical tabloid news such as [“Drop your cellulite – with sock,”](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/9mpdmE/slipp-dina-celluliter--med-strumpa) as well as reports on [celebrity gossip](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/Opg8X1/magnus-hedman-de-pratade-om-elchocker) and [questionable dietary advice](https://www.aftonbladet.se/sok?q=diet). They generally source their news stories to credible outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [TT News Agency](https://tt.se/en/about-us/) ( National wire service in Sweden, established in 1920), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/).
