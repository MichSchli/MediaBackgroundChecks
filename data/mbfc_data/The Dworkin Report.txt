According to their [about page](https://dworkinreport.com/about-us/), Scott Dworkin is “Senior Advisor and Lead Investigator of the Democratic Coalition as well as a proud member of #TheResistance, Scott helped uncover the Trump-Russia affair and explained it to a national audience on [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/) well before Special Counsel Mueller’s probe began.
Grant Stern “writes national news columns at the
[Washington Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-press/), an [Occupy Democrats](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/occupy-democrats/) website and on [TheSternFacts.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-stern-facts/), as well as the occasional op-ed column in the [Miami Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/miami-herald/), in addition to his duties as the Dworkin Report’s Producer.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Dworkin Report primarily publishes strongly left-leaning podcasts with a summary text description underneath and occasionally a link to the full transcript. Topics are always pro-left and denigrate the right, in particular, former President Trump and his administration. Headlines are often sensationalized, such as this:
[Rob Reiner just predicted how Trump’s “corrupt and criminal” presidency will end](https://dworkinreport.com/2019/01/05/rob-reiner-just-predicted-how-trumps-corrupt-and-criminal-presidency-will-end/). The source for this podcast is an interview with [liberal activist Rob Reiner](https://www.influencewatch.org/person/rob-reiner/). In general, most podcasts consist of an interview with left-leaning political figures. Due to these being audio podcasts, there is not hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, The Dworkin Report is strongly left-biased, with Scott Dworkin being co-founder of the PAC,
[Democratic Coalition](https://ballotpedia.org/The_Democratic_Coalition). Grant Stern, on the other hand, is affiliated with the questionable left-wing source, Occupy Democrats.
