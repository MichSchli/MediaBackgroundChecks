History
[The National Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Alliance_(United_States)) is a white supremacist, neo-Nazi, anti-semitic, and white separatist political organization. It was founded by prominent white supremacist William Luther Pierce in 1974 and was based in Hillsboro, West Virginia. Membership in 2002 was estimated at 2,500 with an annual income of $1 million. Membership declined after Pierce’s death in 2002, and after a split in its ranks in 2005, the group has been barely functioning. At this point, the National Alliance has merged and become [National Vanguard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-vanguard/), which holds the same policy positions.

Analysis / Bias
On the National Alliance website, they publish stories directly from the National Vanguard, a white supremacist hate group. The
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) has both groups classified as [hate groups](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/national-alliance). Under the What We Believe category, they clearly state their hateful, racist agenda “We believe that no multi-racial society can be a truly healthy society, and no government which is not wholly responsible to a single racial entity can be a good government. America’s present deterioration stems from her loss of racial homogeneity and racial consciousness and from the consequent alienation of most of our fellow citizens.”
