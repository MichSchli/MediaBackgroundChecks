Analysis / Bias
1 News publishes news with emotionally loaded language, such as
[“‘Wonderful’- Gay man who worked as conversion therapist backs Government’s move to ban practice.”](https://www.1news.co.nz/2021/02/22/wonderful-gay-man-who-worked-as-conversion-therapist-backs-governments-move-to-ban-practice/) A quote from the article reads, “Marjoram’s journey was complete when he founded an organization called Silent Gays, an independent service that addresses the abuses of religion and conversion therapy.”
In another article,
[“National’s Pugh ‘yet to see’ evidence of man-made climate change,”](https://www.1news.co.nz/2023/02/21/nationals-pugh-yet-to-see-evidence-of-man-made-climate-change/) 1 News maintains journalistic standards for balance and reports on all sides of an issue such as when covering climate change and National MP Pugh’s skepticism, a quote from the article reads “Asked if she believed in man-made climate change, Pugh said she had “yet to see the response from [Climate Change Minister] James Shaw.” Yet the article gives more weight to the scientific evidence regarding man-made climate change hence the pro-science stance.
Regarding sourcing, 1 News uses quotes and credible sources such as un.org,
[USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), and the [Associated Press. ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)
