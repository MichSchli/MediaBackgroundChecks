Analysis / Bias
The website has a tagline (on Facebook) that reads “world through the eyes of Russia”. The
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) reports that [Russian intelligence officers](https://apnews.com/3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1?utm_medium=AP&utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter) are using InfoRos.ru, Infobrics.org, and OneWorld.press to “spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic.”
In review, InfoRos.ru reports news from a pro-Russian government perspective. Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional wording that is negative toward America such as this
[“USA is dictating its rights to the world”](https://inforos.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=98610) and [“The Ins And Outs Of The West’s Anti-Russian Infowar.”](http://inforos.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=86133) Typically, InfoRos either sources to quotes or questionable [Russian sources](https://inforos.ru/?module=news&action=view&id=45166) such as [topwar.ru](https://en.topwar.ru/about.html) and [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/). When reporting on the United States they often take a right-wing perspective that is supportive of President Trump: [ “Trump realizes benefits of good relations with Russia”](http://inforos.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=102124). Further, when reporting on Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden they report negatively and promote conspiracies such as this [Ukrainian trap for Biden](http://inforos.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=112308). This story is sourced to Trump Advisor Rudy Guiliani who demonstrates a [poor track record](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/rudy-giuliani/) with fact-checkers and has promoted [Ukrainian conspiracy theories](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/oct/02/fact-checking-rudy-giulianis-claims-about-joe-bide/). In general, news reporting is strongly right biased that promotes pro-Russian propaganda.
