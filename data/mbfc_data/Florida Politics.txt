In review, Florida Politics reports political news with minimally loaded emotional language such as
[“As flu season approaches, the ‘Test and treat’ turf war rages on”](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/355720-as-flu-season-approaches-the-test-and-treat-turf-war-rages-on) and [“Donald, and Melania Trump now registered Florida voters.”](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/311527-donald-melania-trump-florida-voters) When it comes to sourcing, they utilize sources such as the factually mixed left-biased [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and the left-biased mostly factual [thedailybeast.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) as well as credible sources such as justice.gov and the [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/); however, some articles don’t link to sources at all, such as this “ [Marlon Hill, Kionne McGhee dominate funding race in Miami-Dade County Commission contest.”](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/352989-close-funding-race-continues-in-miami-dade-county-commission-race)
Editorially, based on our review, they cover Republicans
[“Marco Rubio warns Antifa, ‘ethnic’ nationalists ‘not taking weekend off’](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/336664-rubio-race-marco) and Democrats [‘Kionne McGhee snags trio of labor endorsements in Miami-Dade Commission bid”](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kionne+McGhee&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS912US912&oq=Kionne+McGhee&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i61&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) in a favorable tone. Opinion pieces are clearly labeled as Email & Opinion that feature various writers from different political perspectives; however, none could be classified as far left or far right. Generally, the news is reported factually with a reasonable balance in opinions and story selection.
