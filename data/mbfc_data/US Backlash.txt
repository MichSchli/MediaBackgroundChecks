Analysis / Bias
In review, US Backlash publishes extreme right-biased news and commentary in favor of the Trump administration. Headlines and wording often are extremely emotional and frequently utilize profanity such as this:
[Dumb-Ass Susan Rice Thinks President Trump Should Notify DNC Losers Everytime Trump Does Shit Obama Couldn’t](https://usbacklash.org/dumb-ass-susan-rice-thinks-president-trump-should-notify-dnc-losers-everytime-trump-does-shit-obama-couldnt/). This article, like the rest, does not provide hyperlinked sourcing but rather quotes a news story and interjects far-right opinions.
US Backlash’s sole purpose is to promote former President Donald Trump through aggressive propaganda. For example, although they routinely denigrate liberals as
[criminals and pedophiles,](https://usbacklash.org/dangerous-nbc-cbs-abc-cnn-msnbc-fake-news-liars-also-protect-leftist-criminal-rapists-pedophiles/) they also attack conservatives who they deem not loyal to Trump, such as this: [ALABAMA – PLEASE REJECT NUTLESS JEFF SESSIONS & ELECT A CONSERVATIVE WHO HAS SOME BALLS – THANK YOU!](https://usbacklash.org/alabama-please-reject-nutless-jeff-sessions-elect-a-conservative-who-has-some-balls-thank-you/) and this, [Increasingly leftist Fox News Pussies Refuse to Speak Name of Alleged Hoaxblower Eric Ciaramella](https://usbacklash.org/increasingly-leftist-fox-news-pussies-refuse-to-speak-name-of-alleged-hoaxblower-eric-ciaramella/).
In general, US Backlash is a pro-Trump propaganda website that poorly sources information and uses extremely emotional wording to sway its audience.
