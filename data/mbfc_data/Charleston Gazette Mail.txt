Analysis / Bias
In review, the Charleston Gazette reports news, crime, sports, and lifestyle for the greater Charleston area. Local articles and headlines use minimally loaded emotional language, such as this
[City fire department on track to fill holes left by retirees, new chief says.](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/kanawha_valley/city-fire-department-on-track-to-fill-holes-left-by-retirees-new-chief-says/article_4f7f0b84-0ea6-55c2-8316-871bf353ed7a.html) National and international news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, the reporting tends to favor the left, such as this
[Gazette-Mail editorial: WV GOP needs to return to planet Earth](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/opinion/editorial/gazette-mail-editorial-wv-gop-needs-to-return-to-planet-earth/article_64a721c3-2f9f-5dd7-b165-1ff531668c7b.html). The news is generally reported factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
