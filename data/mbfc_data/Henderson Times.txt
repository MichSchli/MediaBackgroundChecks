History
The Henderson Times is one of 50+ progressive-liberal imposter news websites designed to look like a local media outlet. The website is published by Local Report Inc, which appears to be connected to the
[American Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-independent-institute/), a progressive liberal organization started by Democratic political operative [David Brock in 2014.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Independent_Institute) David Brock also controls [Media Matters for America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-matters/) and the super PAC [American Bridge 21st Century](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-bridge-21st-century/), which focuses on “tracking” Republican candidates.
The website lacks transparency as they do not have an about page or disclose ownership.

Analysis / Bias
The Henderson Times website is designed to look like a local media outlet. The website uses a similar template as the other 50+ Local Report Inc Network imposter sites. The network also republishes articles from The American Independent’s website, with a disclosure at the bottom of articles that reads, “This story was written by (author name), a contributor for The American Independent, where this story first appeared.”
In review, the Henderson Times publishes local news stories (Nevada) focused on sports, entertainment, and business news giving the appearance of being a legitimate local news source. However, they often publish partisan news and opinion stories that favor the left and the Democratic Party, such as this
[Groups Press for Debt Cancellation to Lessen Racial Wealth Gap](https://hendersontimes.org/groups-press-for-debt-cancellation-to-lessen-racial-wealth-gap/). Further, [according](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/06/democrats-local-news-david-brock) to an [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/) investigation, other sources in the network have misrepresented news stories on opposition candidates.
Editorially, local news is reported with minimal bias; however, all op-eds favor the left and sometimes denigrate the right. In general, this is a left-leaning imposter website that promotes Democratic Party propaganda and lacks transparency.
