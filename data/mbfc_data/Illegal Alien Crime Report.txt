Analysis / Bias
The Illegal Alien Crime Report, reports on crimes that are allegedly committed by illegal immigrants. Headlines are typically written in bold lettering and accompanied by a mugshot or negative image. Wording is typically moderately biased, such as this:
[AFRICAN ‘MIGRANT’ REPEATEDLY RAPED DISABLED WOMAN IN SEATTLE NURSING HOME](https://www.illegalaliencrimereport.com/african-migrant-repeatedly-raped-disabled-woman-in-seattle-nursing-home/). Although this story is copied virtually word for word from KLTV, the original article has a very different headline: [Family sets up hidden camera in nursing home, catches man sexually assaulting patient](https://www.kltv.com/2019/08/02/family-sets-up-hidden-camera-nursing-home-catches-man-sexually-assaulting-patient/).
The original reporting also does not mention anything about migrant status. In fact,
[a search](https://www.google.com/search?ei=1QxLXZ-_FYeSlwTQraigBw&q=Nshimiyiana+Hamzat+immigrant&oq=Nshimiyiana+Hamzat+immigrant&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160.15493.17217..17587...0.0..0.300.2114.0j6j3j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......35i302i39j33i21.uOLEEpif1aM&ved=&uact=5) indicates that only Illegal Alien Crime Report describes the alleged rapist as a “migrant.” They claim without evidence that “Hamzat is not a citizen and came to this country from Nigeria.” While that may be true, without evidence, it simply is not credible. Further, if this person is not a citizen, that does not mean he is illegal. It seems this website targets all immigrants rather than just illegals, as their name suggests.
Another theme found on the website is that there is a supposed media blackout on crimes committed by illegal aliens. Yet, ironically most of the stories are linked to local media sources. For example, in this story:
[MEDIA BLACKOUT: TRUCK DRIVER WHO KILLED 7 BIKERS IS FOREIGN NATIONAL WITH HISTORY OF DUI/DRUG CHARGES](https://www.illegalaliencrimereport.com/media-blackout-truck-driver-who-killed-7-bikers-is-foreign-national-with-history-of-dui-drug-charges/), the original source is the [Boston Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-herald/), which does not seem like a media blackout. Once again, this person was not an illegal immigrant but was a green card holder and here legally.
In general, the stories published on Illegal Alien Crime Report are factual and linked to evidence, however, the author often interjects subjective opinions regarding a person’s legal status without providing evidence. Further, the stories do not just attempt to demonize illegal immigrants but rather any (legal) immigrant who commits a crime. Perhaps they should change the name to Migrant Crime Report?
