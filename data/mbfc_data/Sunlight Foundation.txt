History
The Sunlight Foundation is an American organization that advocates for open government. The organization was founded in
[April 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight_Foundation) with the goal of increasing transparency and accountability in the United States Congress, the executive branch, and in state and local governments. The foundation’s primary focus is the role of money in politics. The organization seeks to increase campaign finance regulations and disclosure requirements.
According to their
[about page](https://sunlightfoundation.com/about/) one of their missions is to “include reporting on President Trump’s conflicts of interest, ethics, and transparency in the federal government, monitoring federal data integrity.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Sunlight Foundation publishes information that promotes transparency and ways to achieve greater Democratic participation. The website features their
[web integrity project](https://sunlightfoundation.com/web-integrity-project/), which monitors changes to government websites. They also engage in advocacy with both congress and the executive branch. Further, the website features a blog that publishes related news with a left-leaning bias through story selection such as this: [Changes to Department of Labor and Healthcare.gov websites foreshadowed formal LGBTQ policy shifts](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2019/11/21/changes-to-department-of-labor-and-medicare-websites-foreshadowed-formal-lgbtq-policy-shifts/). This story is properly sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the Department of Labor. The website frequently reports on the Trump Administration and most times it is not in a favorable light, [This Week in Conflicts: A Whistleblower Complaint, the Fight for Trump’s Taxes and an Emoluments Lawsuit Revived](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2019/09/20/this-week-in-conflicts-a-whistleblower-complaint-the-fight-for-trumps-taxes-and-an-emoluments-lawsuit-revived/).
Editorially, the primary position of the Sunlight Foundation is for more regulation and limitations regarding campaign finance. For example, they are very opposed to
[Citizens United](https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/disclosing-money/), which allowed an unregulated influx of money into elections from corporations and labor unions. In general, The Sunlight Foundation is factual and holds left-leaning policy positions.
