Analysis / Bias
In this analysis, we explore the essay “
[The Right to Leave”](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/migration/right-leave) from Lapham’s Quarterly’s ‘Migration’ volume, which examines Thomas Jefferson’s historical views on migration and their relevance to contemporary immigration policies. Starting with the American Revolution’s “right to leave” it reflects Lapham’s style of exploring historical narratives and their modern implications.
While lacking formal citations, Lapham’s Quarterly draws from historical, legal, and philosophical sources to support its arguments about Jefferson’s views on migration and leaving one’s country. These include legal documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention. Finally, the article critiques Donald Trump’s border policies in contrast to Thomas Jefferson’s advocacy for open migration and the right to leave.
Another essay we analyzed, titled “
[A Climate of Change,”](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/climate/climate-change) explores how the Little Ice Age reshaped human history, drawing parallels to contemporary climate challenges. Author Philipp Blom illustrates how societies of that era adapted to changing environmental conditions, leading to profound transformations in various aspects of life. The essay acknowledges the scientific consensus on global warming, stating, “there is no doubt about the science.”
Additionally, it advocates for “fast and radical decarbonization” based on scientific understanding. This essay presents a pro-science view on climate change. In general, Lapham’s advocates a left-leaning perspective editorially and is fact-based.
