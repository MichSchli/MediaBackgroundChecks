Analysis / Bias
In review, Bleeping Computer reports news on computer issues and, in particular, virus and malware prevention and removal. There is little use of biased wording such as this:
[Microsoft Discovers Fileless Astaroth Trojan Campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-discovers-fileless-astaroth-trojan-campaign/). This story, like all others, is properly sourced. Bleeping Computer does not report on politics or offer opinions. The only time politics is covered is when reporting how it relates to computers, such as this: [Trump Signs Bill Banning Kaspersky Products on Government Computers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/trump-signs-bill-banning-kaspersky-products-on-government-computers/).
