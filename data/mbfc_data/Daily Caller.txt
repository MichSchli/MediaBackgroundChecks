Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Caller is a strongly conservative news and opinion website involved in publishing controversial and false stories. For example, they routinely
[publish misleading](https://dailycaller.com/2017/02/05/noaa-scientists-manipulated-temperature-data-to-make-global-warming-seem-worse/) or false information regarding [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) that goes against the [consensus of science](https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/daily-caller-uncritically-reports-misleading-satellite-temperature-study-michael-bastasch/). The Daily Caller has also [published](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/142984/daily-caller-just-fine-publishing-white-supremacists) articles by [Jason Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kessler), a white supremacist who organized [a rally of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally). They subsequently scrubbed those articles after the Charlottesville vehicular homicide incident.
The Daily Caller frequently uses loaded emotional language that favors the right:
[DEM NOMINEE FOR FLORIDA GOVERNOR IS PROGRESSIVE MAYOR WITH CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION SWIRLING AROUND HIM.](https://dailycaller.com/2018/08/28/desantis-gillum-florida-primary/) The Daily Caller usually sources their information to credible media outlets. Still, sometimes they utilize factually mixed sources, such as the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), and [Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/) sources, such as [Judicial Watch](https://dailycaller.com/2018/07/26/judicial-watch-doj-comey-lawsuit/). In reviewing story content, virtually all favored the right in story selection and wording while denigrating the left. The Daily Caller also promotes a favorable view of Former President Donald Trump by promoting his policies.
