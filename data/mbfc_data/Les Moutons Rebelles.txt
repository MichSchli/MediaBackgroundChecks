Analysis / Bias
Les Moutons Rebelles publishes news and opinions covering France/European News, US News, Science, and Health. The Rebel Sheep does not perform original reporting but instead publishes articles based on other sources such as
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). However, they also frequently utilize poor sources such as [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [Truth Theory](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-theory/), and others that promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. We also found several articles without a source listed.
Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording that favors right-leaning conspiracy theories such as this
[A green light for the containment of the unvaccinated in Austria expected on Sunday](https://lesmoutonsrebelles.com/un-feu-vert-pour-le-confinement-des-non-vaccines-en-autriche-attendu-dimanche/). The source for this story is the discredited conspiracy site [Disclose TV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/disclose-tv/). The website frequently promotes conspiracy theories on [9/11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181004140025/http://lesmoutonsrebelles.com/des-preuves-que-la-technologie-holographique-a-ete-utilisee-le-11-septembre-sur-le-world-trade-center/), [False Flags](https://lesmoutonsrebelles.com/false-flag-les-usa-accusent-liran-davoir-attaque-des-petroliers-dans-le-golfe/), and especially Covid-19. For example, they report that [Covid-19 is a biological weapon created by the Chinese](https://web.archive.org/web/20200311211139/https://lesmoutonsrebelles.com/virus-2019-ncov-la-piste-de-larme-biologique-se-precise-de-plus-en-plus/) and [Didier Raoult: “The Case Fatality Rate of Covid Patients when Treated with Hydroxychloroquine: 0.1%!”](https://lesmoutonsrebelles.com/didier-raoult-le-taux-de-letalite-des-patients-du-covid-lorsquils-sont-traites-avec-lhydroxychloroquine-01/) There is [no evidence](https://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/end-hydroxychloroquine-treatment-covid-19) to support the use of Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment/prevention for Covid-19. In general, Les Moutons Rebelles promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience from a right-leaning perspective.
