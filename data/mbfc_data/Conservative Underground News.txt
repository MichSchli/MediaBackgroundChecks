Analysis / Bias
Conservative Underground News does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left, such as this:
[Ron DeSantis was all smiles after he was handed this unexpected victory over Gavin Newsom](https://conservativeundergroundnews.com/ron-desantis-was-all-smiles-after-he-was-handed-this-unexpected-victory-over-gavin-newsom/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Karine Jean-Pierre is in hot water after a social media post from her past came back to bite her](https://conservativeundergroundnews.com/karine-jean-pierre-is-in-hot-water-after-a-social-media-post-from-her-past-came-back-to-bite-her/), and [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hung her head in shame after a Democrat made this massive blunder](https://conservativeundergroundnews.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-hung-her-head-in-shame-after-a-democrat-made-this-massive-blunder/). In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing pro-Trump conspiracy theories and propaganda while sometimes using poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
