History
[Founded in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepresentUs) by [Josh Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Silver_(nonprofit_director)) and [Joshua Graham Lynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joshua_Graham_Lynn&action=edit&redlink=1), Represent.us is a website dedicated to ending corruption in politics. According to their [about page](https://represent.us/about/) “We bring together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and fix our broken elections.”
Funded by / Ownership
RepresentUs includes two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit entities: RepresentUs Education Fund 501(c)(3) and RepresentUs 501(c)(4). Revenue is derived through donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Represent.Us publishes a combination of original writing as well as curated news stories to external sources. Their Live Blog features original content geared toward anti-corruption measures in elections. Editorially, Represent.us is mostly opposed to President Trump’s platform as they want to end Citizens United and stop corporations from having more power than the worker. For example, they want to end
[Citizen’s United](https://reformfirst.com/), which gives corporations an equals voice to living human citizens. From a political standpoint, they favor progressive left candidates over establishment candidates: [THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ANTI‑CORRUPTION SCORECARD](https://represent.us/2020-scorecard/). In general, Represent.us is factual with a left-leaning bias politically.
