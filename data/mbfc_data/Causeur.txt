Analysis / Bias
Causeur.fr is a
[conservative](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/163150/causeur) magazine presenting strong viewpoints on political and societal issues, including immigration, religion, and climate. The articles are often opinionated and provocative and usually lack hyperlinks. For instance, in an article titled “ [Immigration costs France far more than 6.57 billion euros,”](https://www.causeur.fr/immigration-france-cour-des-comptes-176708) the author criticizes the government and the Court for handling these estimates. The piece cites a Court of Auditors report and a CEPII study but doesn’t provide direct links.
Another article,
[Economism, and Transhumanism: more worrying than a pension reform!”](https://www.causeur.fr/economisme-et-transhumanisme-plus-preoccupants-quune-reforme-des-retraites-258247) exhibit right-wing bias through its emotionally loaded language and the framing of certain issues. A quote from the article reads: “The brutalization of French society? The fault of precariousness. Jihadism? It is because of the territorial and economic “apartheid” of which young people are victims.” Finally, a piece discussing climate marches in Belgium under [“Divergence of struggles, once!”](https://www.causeur.fr/belgique-bruxelles-youth-for-climate-ecologie-167298) is written in a somewhat skeptical tone toward the climate marchers.
Several French media sources have linked Elisabeth Lévy, the director of Causeur, with
[climate skepticism](https://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/societe/2019/03/08/31003-20190308ARTFIG00315-elisabeth-levy-pour-la-raison-ecologique-contre-les-climato-fanatiques.php). She states, “The climate threat exists. But if it were as deadly and imminent as we are told, the military would already be patrolling our streets to force us into near energy abstinence.”
Politically, Causeur strongly favors former President Trump:
[Faced with Trump, the American left has no coherent program](https://www.causeur.fr/face-a-trump-la-gauche-americaine-na-pas-de-programme-coherent-164632) and frequently denigrates President Biden: [Biden/archives: when the monkey wants to climb the coconut tree…](https://www.causeur.fr/joe-biden-archives-wilmington-252800) Finally, the website has promoted misinformation regarding [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/), such as claiming [Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) invaded them because of [Nazism](https://www.causeur.fr/pourquoi-vladimir-poutine-voit-il-des-nazis-en-ukraine-226853) and has promoted the [Stolen 2020 election conspiracy theory](https://www.causeur.fr/trump-ou-biden-qui-a-gagne-lelection-de-2020-etats-unis-246672). In general, Causeur is far-right biased and promotes false and misleading information.
