Analysis / Bias
In review, The Korea Times publishes tabloid-style news such as entertainment, arts, culture, sports, and world news. Examples:
[“Train drivers turn to drink after witnessing suicides”](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/05/119_249098.html) and [“Grace Lee admits dating former Filipino President Aquino.”](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2018/05/398_249065.html) Typically they source through large quotes and rarely provide direct links to their sources.
For example, this is a quote from an
[article](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/05/103_248952.html) that does not provide a source for the information: “The U.S. secretly took more than 1,600 rocket scientists, engineers and technicians from post-Nazi Germany between 1945 and 1959. The migrants then provided the intelligence and expertise behind the U.S. space program in a race against the Soviet Union.” However, The Korea Times also uses the [Yonhap News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap) for reporting foreign news, and when it comes to national politics, their leaning is Left-Center. For example, in the article: [“Hong Joon-pyo intensifies ideological attack on Moon](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/01/356_242883.html),” there is a biased quote ”Hong Joon-pyo has politicized the movement as a measure to attack his liberal rivals.” Note that Hong Joon-pyo is Chairman of the LKP (Liberty Korea Party), the opposition conservative party of South Korea. The President of South Korea is Moon Jae-in, and he was the Leader of the [Democratic Party,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Korea) which is center-left.
