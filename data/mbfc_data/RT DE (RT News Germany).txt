History
[Founded in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)), RT, originally Russia Today, is a television network funded by the Russian Government. It operates cable and satellite television channels directed to audiences outside of Russia and provides Internet content in various languages, including Russian. Critics of RT claim they are a source of disinformation and [pro-Russian propaganda](https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/looking-west-russia-beefs-up-spending-on-global-media-giants-39708).
RT DE was launched in 2014, covering German and international news from a pro-Russian perspective. According to their about page, “RT DE gives its audience a glimpse into the logic, interests, and views of Russia. We strongly believe that the Russian position does not have to be shared but that it should be understood. We give our viewers and readers the opportunity to turn the large chessboard to see the playing field from a different perspective.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, RT DE News presents news generally in line with the Russian Government’s narrative, often opposed to the German media. When it comes to covering USA/International News, they provide right-of-center coverage. They are highly biased in favor of Russia and occasionally run

In general, most international news stories on RT are factual and relate to actual events; however, there are occasional pieces that spin these facts into a different narrative that is misleading. Another concerning aspect of RT is they do not list author information for articles published on the website. This presents a lack of transparency that makes it difficult to verify the information.
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, they have made false and misleading claims regarding vaccines such as this
