Analysis / Bias
In review, Tarbell reports news on how corporate interests influence energy, taxation, politics, and health care. However, the primary focus is advocacy for universal healthcare (Medicare for All). Story selection often favors liberal/progressive policies on healthcare such as this:
[A for-profit company bought, then closed, a Philadelphia hospital. Medicare for All could have saved it.](https://tarbell.org/2019/08/a-for-profit-company-bought-then-closed-a-philadelphia-hospital-medicare-for-all-could-have-saved-it/?ref=featured) This story is listed as commentary and does not provide hyperlinked sourcing. In this analysis piece: [Senator Harris: You really need to rethink your plan to put private insurers in charge of Medicare,](https://tarbell.org/2019/07/senator-harris-you-really-need-to-rethink-your-plan-to-put-private-insurers-in-charge-of-medicare/?ref=featured) there is the appropriate use of hyperlinked sourcing to credible media outlets.
The website also features an
[Investigations](https://tarbell.org/category/investigations/) and [Solutions](https://tarbell.org/solutions/) section, both of which rely on proper sourcing of information. In general, Tarbell leans left editorially through policy positions that weaken corporate influence on politics.
