Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hindu Business Line uses moderately loaded words in their headlines, such as this
[The long, winding road to a free market](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/the-long-winding-road-to-a-free-market/article32357194.ece?homepage=true). This article is typical of most advocates for free-market capitalism.
Politically, The Hindu Business Times rarely criticizes right-leaning Prime Minister Modi
[Independence Day: PM Modi continues ‘safa’ tradition; opts for saffron, cream turban](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/variety/independence-day-pm-modi-continues-safa-tradition-opts-for-saffron-cream-turban/article32362708.ece). In general, they align with the right-leaning government and promote free-market capitalism.
