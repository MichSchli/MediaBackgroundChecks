Analysis / Bias
In review, Salon focuses on U.S. politics and current affairs. Story selection almost always favors the left, and there is the frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[What campus free speech? Arizona case shows how far the right will go to stifle dissent](https://www.salon.com/2019/04/07/what-campus-free-speech-arizona-case-shows-how-far-the-right-will-go-to-stifle-dissent/). Like most on Salon, this story is properly sourced to credible media such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the [Arizona Republic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/arizona-republic/) and occasionally uses sources that have failed fact checks such as [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and [Wikileaks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikileaks/). Salon also publishes health and science news that is [scientifically based](https://www.salon.com/category/science-and-health).
Editorially, Salon utilizes strong wording that is anti-right in a tone such as this:
[Donald Trump is running for president as a flat-out racist](https://www.salon.com/2019/03/20/donald-trump-is-running-for-president-as-a-flat-out-racist/). Further, they do not clearly label opinion pieces which can be misleading.
It was revealed by numerous media outlets, including the left-leaning
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), that [Salon waited one year](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/fact-check-desantis-florida-students-professors-political-views/index.html) to correct a fact related to Ron DeSantis. See failed fact check below.
