Analysis / Bias
In review, In These Times publishes news and opinion articles from a Democratic Socialist perspective. There is the frequent use of emotionally loaded language that favors the left, such as this:
[To Save Species from Extinction, We Must Consider More than Just Numbers](http://inthesetimes.com/rural-america/entry/22174/endangered-species-act-recovery-extinction-habitat-ecosystem-function-bison). Although biased in wording, this story is properly sourced to scientific studies as well as The [Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/). Story selection always favors the progressive left and often denigrates the right and establishment Democrats like this: [Joe Biden Lied His Face Off About the Iraq War](http://inthesetimes.com/article/22056/joe-biden-iraq-war-democratic-debate-2020).
Editorially, In These Times always favors the progressive left and denigrates corporations and those who support them. They often report favorably on Democratic Socialist candidates such as Bernie Sanders, as evidenced by this:
[Want More Proof of Corporate Media’s Anti-Bernie Bias? Look at MSNBC’s Democratic Debate.](https://inthesetimes.com/article/22180/msnbc-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-democratic-debate-2020) In general, In These Times aligns with what would be considered the far left today: Pro-Environment, Pro-Choice, Pro-Feminism, Anti-Capitalism, Anti-Militarism, and Pro-Civil Rights. While these may not seem like extreme issues, in our current political climate, they are considered on the far end of the left. In general, In These Times sources information correctly and is factual while holding a far-left editorial bias.
