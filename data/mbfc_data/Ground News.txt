Analysis
Ground News publishes a summary of a news story and then provides links to other sources reporting on the same news. Each link is assigned a bias rating of either Left, Center, or Right. You are given the option to click on the source or leaving the website/app to read the story. When you click on the source link, you are given more detailed information where the source is labeled one of “
[seven bias ratings](https://ground.news/media-bias) (Far Left, Left, Leans Left, Center, Leans Right, Right, Far Right) based on the average bias rating of the publishing news Bias Rating agencies.” Ground News states that they do not determine bias ratings on their methodology page but rather rely on authoritative bias raters, [Media Bias Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/about/), [Allsides.com](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news), and [Ad Fontes Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/all-generalizations-are-false-ad-fontes-media/).
The website/app also features Blindspot, highlighting a news story disproportionally reported by one side. For example, the story
[Conservative think tank creates ‘A to Z guide’ for stopping critical race theory in schools](https://ground.news/article/00010c24-d016-42fb-9213-84eee3b256f7) is meant for the Left’s blindspot because 6 out of 7 news sources reporting this story have a right bias. Another feature of Ground News is they display a map of where the source originates from.
Bias
Ground News does not appear to favor the left or right when publishing news stories, and they provide the bias rating of each source as determined by credible bias raters. While they present news with minimal bias, they do not factor in the credibility of the source. For example, we found that they publish news stories from sources that routinely fail fact checks, such as
[PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/), [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/), and Alex Jones’ [Newswars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newswars/) website, which has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and falsehoods daily. However, these stories are also being reported by other credible media outlets, which indicates they are most likely true. In general, Ground News is not biased, but some news sources utilized have poor track records with fact-checkers.
