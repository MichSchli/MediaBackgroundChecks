Analysis / Bias
In review, ICR promotes different media on pseudoscientific creation science and interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a historical event. It rejects evolutionary biology, which it views as a corrupting moral and social influence and threat to religious belief.
Nearly
[all scientists](https://web.archive.org/web/20140307163155/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta07%2FERES1580.htm) reject young-earth creationism, which attempts to interpret the bible and correlate it to science literally. Even when reporting on an actual cosmic event such as this [Perseid Meteor Shower Peaks Next Week](https://www.icr.org/article/perseid-meteor-shower-peaks-next-week/), they manage to tie it back to pseudoscience with this quote: “Creation scientists would argue that this is because comets, as well as the rest of our solar system, are young, having been created by God about 6,000 years ago.” In general, this is a quackery-level pseudoscience source based on promoting Young-Earth Creationism, universally debunked by science.
