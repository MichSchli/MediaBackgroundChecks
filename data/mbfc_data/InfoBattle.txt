Analysis / Bias
Reviews for satire websites focus on whether they properly disclose their intentions. InfoBattle does not directly state they are satire; however, the website description makes it clear they are sarcastic: “Information Battle is run by proud Americans, proud Americans who need to help inform the uninformed masses about government conspiracies and Jewish space lasers. We are huge fans of the American government and the police force, and we don’t like 5G.” In general, they are a satire site that pokes fun at American conservatives and conspiracy theorists.
