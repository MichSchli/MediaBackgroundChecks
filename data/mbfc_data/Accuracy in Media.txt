History
Accuracy In Media (AIM) is an American non-profit news media watchdog
[founded in 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_in_Media) by economist Reed Irvine. AIM describes itself as “a non-profit, grassroots citizens watchdog of the news media that critiques botched and bungled news stories and sets the record straight on important issues that have received slanted coverage.” It has been described as having a politically conservative stance.

Funded by / Ownership
Accuracy in Media is a non-profit organization that receives funding through individual donations and corporate, political, and organizational donations. Although AIM discloses their 990 Tax forms, they do not openly list donors. Through research, we have found that the bulk of funding comes from right-wing think tanks and the
[fossil fuel industry](https://www.desmogblog.com/accuracy-media), such as Exxon, Getty Oil, and Phillips Petroleum.
Analysis
In review, Accuracy in Media reports news with very strong right-wing bias in the hopes of refuting the mainstream media (perceived left). Most stories contain loaded emotional language that always favors the right:

This story is appropriately sourced from credible information. AIM also frequently promotes the Trump administration through rarely criticizing and regularly praising the President: [Associated Press Undercuts Trump-is-Racist Argument in Article about Virginia Ceremony](https://www.aim.org/aim-column/associated-press-undercuts-trump-is-racist-argument-in-article-about-virginia-ceremony/). The website also provides a link to their sister site, [Accuracy in Academia](https://www.aim.org/aim-column/associated-press-undercuts-trump-is-racist-argument-in-article-about-virginia-ceremony/), which Media Bias Check has rated as Right Biased and Mixed for factual reporting. Finally, the website has a section titled “ [Bias Watch](https://www.aim.org/don-irvine-blog/)” that showcases perceived left-wing bias in the media.
Bias
Editorially, AIM promotes a conservative agenda while consistently denigrating the left. They also promote conspiracies such as plans for a
[world socialist government](https://www.aim.org/aim-report/the-plan-for-socialist-world-government/), [Vince Foster being murdered by the Clintons](https://www.aim.org/special-report/death-of-vince-foster-part-1/), [Obama Birtherism](https://www.aim.org/aim-column/was-obamas-communist-mentor-his-father/), and [AIDS as a phony crisis](https://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-post-and-the-phony-aids-crisis/). When not promoting debunked conspiracy theories, they routinely [advance pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as human-influenced [Climate Denialism](https://www.aim.org/on-target-blog/climate-change-propaganda-on-cbss-madam-secretary/) (very frequently), promoting [Intelligent Design](https://www.aim.org/briefing/silencing-science/) in favor of Evolutionary Theory, and reporting negatively on [LGBTQ](https://www.aim.org/search/?q=gay+marriage&cx=004572606133216989943%3Ao6bhvwaftm0&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&sa=). Further, the current [Director of AIM](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/cliff-kincaid) has been called an “unrepentant propagandist for extremist right-wing causes who knows few boundaries in his attempts to smear liberal foes.”
