[million first-year budget](https://www.cbs58.com/news/ex-trump-aides-form-new-policy-group-with-20-million-initial-budget). However, according to [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-alumni-launch-america-first-policy), “AFPI didn’t disclose where the $20 million funding had come from but attributed the success of early donations to its leadership.” The site lacks transparency as they do not disclose funding or donors.
Analysis / Bias
The America First Policy Institute (AFPI) publishes policy focuses under the sections titled “Jobs First, Opportunity First, Security First, Freedom First, Innovation First.” The policy focuses sections are headed by ex trump aides or staff. For example,
[Rick Perry](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-alumni-launch-america-first-policy) is responsible for the Center for Energy Independence under the priority “Ïnnovation First.”
Many of the stories are republished from media outlets under the section titled “Latest,” such as
[Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/) (Questionable), and [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). In general, they publish blog posts or op-eds under a section called “Latest,” and most op-ed’s are published with emotionally loaded headlines such as: [“Unemployment benefits and inflation contribute to the growing worker shortage,”](https://americafirstpolicy.com/latest/blog-unemployment-benefits-and-inflation-contribute-to-the-growing-worker-shortagebut-some-states-are-leading-the-way-on-incentivizing-a-return-to-work/) and [“CHSI Blog Post: The Biden Administration Expands the (Illegal) Central American Minors Program.”](https://americafirstpolicy.com/latest/chsi-blog-post/) Both articles are properly sourced through hyperlinking to mostly credible sources such as state.gov, uscis.gov, committeetounleashprosperity.com,dol.gov, FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Database), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), and [Fox Business](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-business/).
Editorially, most articles strongly favor the right and Former President Trump while being critical of the Biden Administration, such as
[“The America First Policy Institute Applauds Lawsuit to Hold Big Tech Accountable.”](https://americafirstpolicy.com/latest/the-america-first-policy-institute-applauds-lawsuit-to-hold-big-tech-accountable/) In this statement, Brooke L.Rollins, President and CEO of AFPI, support Donald Trump for filing a class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
