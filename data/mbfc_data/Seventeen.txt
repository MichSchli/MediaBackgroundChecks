Analysis / Bias
In review, Seventeen primarily covers fashion, beauty, and teen lifestyle on both the website and print magazine. However, they also cover politics with a left-leaning bias in story selection and use of strongly loaded language in headlines, such as this:
[All the Lies Trump Told About Abortion Last Night](https://www.seventeen.com/life/a26226976/trump-state-of-the-union-abortion-lies/) and this [Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People WILL NOT Be Erased](https://www.seventeen.com/health/a24061976/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition/). Both of these stories are properly sourced to credible media such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/). Editorially, Seventeen supports left-leaning causes such as [pro-environment](https://www.seventeen.com/search/?q=climate+change), activism for [LGBTQ](https://www.seventeen.com/lgbtq-teen-life/), and [Feminism](https://www.seventeen.com/life/a12151106/what-is-feminism-why-is-it-important/).
