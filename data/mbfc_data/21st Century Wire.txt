Analysis / Bias
21st Century Wire is an alternative news website that
[rejects the consensus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) of science regarding [climate change](http://21stcenturywire.com/tag/climate-change/) and also promotes the conspiracy that mainstream media is publishing [fake news](http://21stcenturywire.com/tag/fake-news/). This source has also received an unproven claim by [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/syrian-rescue-organization-the-white-helmets-are-terrorists/), which 21st Century Wire considers a questionable source. The website Fort Liberty has placed 21st Century Wire on itâ€™s [Fake News/Hoax list](http://www.fortliberty.org/hoax-sites.html). 21st Century employs somewhat sensational headlines and does provide sourcing to attempt to support claims, however, most are to themselves. The primary issue is that 21st Century publishes some [questionable stories](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) (see examples above) that are embedded among legitimate stories they publish. This can mislead the reader.
