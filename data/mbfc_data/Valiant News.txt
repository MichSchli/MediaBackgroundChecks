According to its about page, “Valiant News is the culmination of years of experience from an editorial team that has written thousands of articles. Our team was at the forefront of the 2016 counter culture led by President Donald Trump, was in Washington, D.C. covering election integrity protests in 2020, helped blow the whistle on Big Tech’s censorship agenda, produced documentaries exposing the international migrant crisis, and knows that journalists must take a stand for medical freedom.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Valiant News primarily covers politics relying on other news sources. Articles and headlines favor a conservative perspective and use moderately loaded emotional wording to influence readers, such as this
[50,000 People Swarmed Town Of Just 5,000 To See A Trump Rally](https://valiantnews.com/2023/07/50000-people-swarmed-town-of-just-5000-to-see-a-trump-rally/). The term “swarmed” is meant to convey how eager people are to see former President Trump, who is running for President in 2024. Right-Leaning fact-checker [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) rated this claim as [Unverified](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-south-carolina-republican-rally-fact-check-1810654).
When it comes to sourcing information Valiant News relies on a mixture of credible sourcing from outlets such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) to questionable sources like the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), which both routinely fail fact checks.
Editorially all stories favor a conservative political perspective and have advanced conspiracy theories related to the Jan 6 riot, such as this
[Trump: Jan 6 Committee Is Hiding Information About Instigators, ‘People Like Ray Epps](https://valiantnews.com/2022/06/trump-jan-6-committee-is-hiding-information-about-instigators-people-like-ray-epps/),’ which claims Ray Epps, an FBI agent was really undercover, and instigated the insurrection. There is [no evidence](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/01/jan-6-conspiracy-theory-centers-on-baseless-claim-about-ray-epps/) to support this claim. Further, the website usually advances former President Trump’s false claims regarding a stolen election in 2020, such as this [Trump Says ‘Rush On The Capitol’ Caused By ‘Rigged And Stolen Election,’ Not Him](https://valiantnews.com/2022/06/trump-says-rush-on-the-capitol-caused-by-rigged-and-stolen-election-not-him/). While this article reports what Trump said, it does indicate that his claims are unproven and, in most cases, baseless.
In general, Valiant News hold strong right-leaning conservative biases and does not always report factual information as evidenced above; therefore, they earn a mixed factual and medium credibility rating.
