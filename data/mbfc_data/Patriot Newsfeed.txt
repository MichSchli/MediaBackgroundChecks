Analysis / Bias
Patriot Newsfeed does not perform original news reporting. A typical story takes a quote from another story and then summarizes and adds opinions around the quotes. Most headlines are highly emotional such as this
[Has AOC Lost Her Crown? She’s Getting Booed and Reacting Strangely – Watch](https://patriotnewsfeed.com/has-aoc-lost-her-crown-shes-getting-booed-and-reacting-strangely-watch/).
Editorially most stories favor the right through story selection and often promote former President Trump, such as this
[Trump Is Going to See CNN in Court](https://patriotnewsfeed.com/trump-is-going-to-see-cnn-in-court/). They also report misinformation regarding covid-19 vaccines, such as this [CDC Moves The Goalposts Says Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20221023201208/https://patriotnewsfeed.com/change-advisary-la-newspaper-report/). This is [not true](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/claim-that-previously-infected-people-dont-transmit-covid-19-unsupported-misinterpretation-of-cdc-foia-response/).
Patriot Newsfeed is right-biased based on story selection and usually does not provide hyperlinked sourcing. Unfortunately, the complete lack of transparency lowers their credibility and renders them Mixed for factual reporting and questionable.
