Analysis / Bias
In review, the primary function of the RNC is to advocate, fund, and promote Republican candidates for all levels of office. The bias of the RNC is very clear; they favor the Republican party and their conservative platform.
The RNC website also publishes news from a conservative perspective that frequently uses loaded emotional language, such as this
[Chairwoman McDaniel: Joe Biden Needs To Get His Facts Straight](https://gop.com/joe-biden-needs-to-get-his-facts-straight/?_ga=2.42514337.527430415.1586700499-52196225.1586700499) and this [President Trump And His Task Force Are Providing Daily Hope for Americans](https://www.gop.com/president-trump-and-his-task-force-are-providing-daily-hope-for-americans/). In general, the news is sometimes poorly sourced to questionable outlets such as [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), while others are very well sourced to credible media and government websites. However, statements made by the RNC have a poor track record with fact-checking.
