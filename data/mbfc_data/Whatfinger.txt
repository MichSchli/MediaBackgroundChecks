[about page](https://www.whatfinger.net/about): “Whatfinger News was founded by military people and 100% unapologetic for being patriotic.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Whatfinger.com is a news aggregation website that primary sources from right-wing news sources. Whatfinger sources from a wide variety of right-leaning websites, some of which are Mixed or low for factual reporting, such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and the [Daily Wire.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/) They also frequently source from Questionable sources such as the [Geller Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geller-report/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). While they do occasionally source from credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), this is rare as the majority are right-leaning and conspiratorial. In general, all aggregated news favors the right.
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have aggregated false and misleading information from
[Dr. Robert Malone](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=robert%20Malone), Gateway Pundit, [The Expose](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-expose/), and [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). Finally, they have published [debunked election fraud information](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/10/special-thank-far-left-democracy-docket-points-stellar-conservatives-2022-mid-terms-plus-extensive-list-election-fraud-evidence/). Generally, this is a questionable source based on routinely relying on sources who fail fact checks and promote pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
