Analysis / Bias:
Punjabi Tribune publishes critical articles on left-wing politics in India. For instance, in the article
[“Punjab facing problems,”](https://www.punjabitribuneonline.com/news/comment/punjab-facing-problems-225624) the author blames left-wing politics for the issues faced by Punjabis and questions the credibility of national leftist thinking. The article states, “On the other hand, national leftist thinking has already lost its credibility.” The article also criticizes the Modi-led central government and suggests that the present government needs to show leadership to guide the youth of Punjab toward a positive future.
Similar to its affiliate publication, Punjabi Tribune is generally factual but lacks hyperlinks to sources for verifying its claims. The outlet also republishes articles from The Tribune (India). In general, more stories favor the right and utilize poor sourcing techniques.
