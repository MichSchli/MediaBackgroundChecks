[The Citizen](https://citizen.co.za/about-us/) is a South African tabloid-style daily newspaper distributed mainly in Gauteng. The Citizen was [founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Luyt) by a South African Business magnate and the former president of the South African Rugby Football Union, Louis Luyt.

A quote from the article reads, “The publisher was Luyt, and he got the money secretly from the government.”
The Citizen focuses on news, business, sport, lifestyle, parenting, entertainment, motoring, horse racing, gaming, and auctions.

[“Iran accuses the US of ‘unacceptable’ escalation in tensions.”](https://citizen.co.za/news/news-world/2131348/iran-accuses-us-of-unacceptable-escalation-in-tensions/) When it comes to publishing national political news, The Citizen utilizes moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this; The [ mayor alludes that Ramaphosa is a charmer who plays around with people’s emotions.](https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/politics/2118140/jacob-zuma-is-an-honest-man-herman-mashaba/) This article is critical of the ANC.

In another article, there is a positive bias regarding the opposition party,
[“Maimane survives as DA leadership takes collective responsibility](https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/politics/2130284/maimane-survives-as-da-leadership-takes-collective-responsibility/)” (Maimane is the leader of DA – The Democratic Alliance Party- the party is [regarded](https://www.cfr.org/blog/background-south-africas-national-elections-may-8) as center-right in economic policy). When sourcing, The Citizen utilizes other South African media sources such as [The Sowetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sowetan) and [The African News Agency (ANA),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_News_Agency) a syndicated, multimedia news and content distribution service.
