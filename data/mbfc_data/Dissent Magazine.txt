Analysis / Bias
In review, Dissent Magazine produces journalism and reports news from a Socialist perspective. Headlines and stories contain minimally to moderately loaded emotional language, such as:
[Can Democratic Socialism Rise in Rural America?](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/can-democratic-socialism-rise-in-rural-america) This story is sourced from interviews and first-person accounts. Other reports reviewed provide hyperlinked sourcing to credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/).
Editorially, Dissent champions Democratic Socialism, Marxism,
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), Labor, and Feminism. They frequently report negatively on President Donald Trump, [Why Trump is Attacking “the Squad,”](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/why-trump-is-attacking-the-squad) and favorably on Progressive Democrats, [Why the Left Needs Liberals](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/why-the-left-needs-liberals). In general, Dissent Magazine reports factually through proper sourcing of information with a socialist left editorial bias.
