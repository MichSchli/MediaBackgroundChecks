Analysis / Bias
In our review of content from
[Druthers](https://druthers.net/), we focused on a selection of articles to identify potential biases. While analyzing every article from the platform is impossible, we will concentrate on three representative pieces to offer insight into the publication’s editorial leanings.
One article,
[“A First Nations Perspective On The 2022 Freedom Convoy”](https://druthers.net/a-first-nations-perspective-on-the-2022-freedom-convoy/) by Dr. Amie Wolf, critiques the Canadian government and draws parallels between the treatment of Indigenous peoples and the Freedom Convoy participants. The article directly critiques [Justin Trudeau](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/justin-trudeau-canada-facts-and-bias/) by insinuating an unfavorable comparison between him and his father, Pierre Trudeau, with the phrase, “It runs in the family, okay?” While some claims might be valid, the lack of external citations raises concerns about its verifiability. For context, the Freedom Convoy began as trucker-led protests against vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions in Canada, gaining significant national and international attention. Figures like former U.S. President Donald Trump notably [endorsed](https://theconversation.com/canadas-freedom-convoy-exposes-political-missteps-and-donald-trumps-ominous-legacy-175898) the movement.
Another piece,
[“Beginner’s Guide To Understanding ‘The Great Reset’,”](https://druthers.net/beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-great-reset/) discusses the concept of “The Great Reset” as a global agenda. The narrative, with references to a one-world government and claims about Bill Gates promoting population reduction through vaccines, promotes a conspiracy theory narrative.
A third article,
[“28 Reasons Canadians Ought To Be Concerned,”](https://druthers.net/28-reasons-canadians-ought-to-be-concerned/) displays skepticism towards the scientific consensus on COVID-19 vaccines, indicating an anti-science stance. The [Canadian Anti-Hate Network](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadian-anti-hate-network-bias/) has criticized Druthers for promoting [conspiracy theories](https://www.antihate.ca/canadian_newspaper_local_protest_publication_nationwide_conspiracy_tabloid_druthers), with contributors like Dr. Vernon Coleman denying AIDS’ existence and [Joseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) misattributing deaths to vaccines.
In summary, Druthers consistently showcases conspiracy-leaning content from a conservative perspective and skepticism toward established narratives.
