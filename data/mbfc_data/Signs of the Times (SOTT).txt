Analysis / Bias
In review, most content on SOTT is republished from other sources, some that are credible and some that are not such as
[RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) and [GreenMedInfo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/greenmedinfo/). Primarily they serve as a source that promotes conspiracy theories such as on 9-11 [911 Commissioner Bob Kerrey says 911 was a conspiracy 30 years in the making](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDfm3NroVG8) as well as [UFOs](https://www.sott.net/article/205013-US-Cigar-Shaped-Object-Disappears-before-Witnesses-Eyes-in-Connecticut) and [anti-vaccine propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this [Why vaccines spread disease and vaccine science is flawed](http://alignlife.com/articles/medicalresearch/why-vaccines-spread-disease-and-vaccine-science-if-flawed?fb_ref=recommendations-bar).

In general, this source provides very little credible information and routinely promotes both conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
