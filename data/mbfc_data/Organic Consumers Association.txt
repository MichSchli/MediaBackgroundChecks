History
[Founded in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_Consumers_Association), The Organic Consumers Association (OCA) is a non-profit advocacy group based in Minnesota for the organic agriculture industry. They state their mission is “to protect and advocate for consumers’ right to safe, healthful food and other consumer products, a just food and farming system and an environment rich in biodiversity and free of pollutants.” According to their [about page](http://organicconsumers.org/about-oca#gsc.tab=0), “OCA educates and advocates on behalf of organic consumers, engages consumers in marketplace pressure campaigns, and works to advance sound food and farming policy through grassroots lobbying.”
The website lacks transparency as it offers limited information on content creators and funding.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Organic Consumers Association is an advocacy/lobbying group that promotes organic food and agricultural processes. They also frequently promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience and make false claims.
Politically, they align with the left as they describe its goals as the encouragement of the U.S. government to expand organic agriculture, utilize fair trade, eliminate genetically modified food, implement universal health care, and obtain energy independence through renewable energy. The organization hopes to “inspire” consumers to buy organic products and to “pressure the USDA and organic companies to preserve strict organic standards.”
The OCA website frequently promotes false or misleading information. For example, they cite
[Mercola.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) as a source of information. However, Joseph Mercola is a known purveyor of pseudoscience who frequently makes [false health claims](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/plague-one-scientists-intrepid-search-truth-about-human-retroviruses-and-chronic-disease#gsc.tab=0). Further, they often publish [anti-vaccination information](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) like [No Historical Benefit in Vaccines: Polish Study](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/no-historical-benefit-vaccines-polish-study#gsc.tab=0). This story comes from the discredited quackery level pseudoscience website [Green Med Info](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/greenmedinfo/). They also promote conspiracy theories related to [9/11](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/great-coverup-11th-anniversary-911#gsc.tab=0) and [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) such as [Spilling the Beans: Unintended GMO Health Risks](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/spilling-beans-unintended-gmo-health-risks#gsc.tab=0). In general, OCA regularly reports false information, conspiracies, and pseudoscience using very poor sources such as [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/).
