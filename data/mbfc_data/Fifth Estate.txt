History
[Fifth Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Estate_(periodical)) (FE) is a U.S. periodical based in Detroit, Michigan, beginning in 1965, but with staff members across North America who connect via the Internet. Its editorial collective sometimes has divergent views on the magazine addresses but generally shares an anarchist, anti-authoritarian outlook and a non-dogmatic, action-oriented approach to change.

Funded by / Ownership
The Fifth Estate does not clearly state ownership and donations; subscriptions and a store that sells back issues are the primary sources of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The website is primarily a means to subscribe to the magazine. They offer web content of their recent publications highlighting their political opposition to capitalism and environmental activism. These political positions are considered left-wing in todayâ€™s political environment. FE does use occasional emotional language, but all information is well-sourced and linked to facts. We cannot find evidence of false claims, and they present an editorial bias left-wing in nature. Due to the little ability to review more info, this is a medium confidence review.
