Analysis / Bias
In review, 12 News Now KBMT reports local news primarily through TV news video and accompanying text. Local news is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[Three Port Neches-Groves students test positive for COVID-19](https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/three-port-neches-groves-students-test-positive-for-covid-19/502-9eaefc9e-4233-4eb5-9eaf-76a9967c173d). National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other TEGNA TV stations.
KBMT also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local Texas politics through 12 News NowTV. Again, the wording is low-biased such as this:
[Texas judge allows Harris County to send all voters applications for mail-in ballots](https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/texas-judge-allows-harris-county-to-send-all-voters-applications-for-mail-in-ballots/285-58b57d54-dd9f-484b-9572-7cd84c393e65). Further, the website does not publish editorial commentary. Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
