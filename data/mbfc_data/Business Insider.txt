Analysis / Bias
In review, Business Insider occasionally publishes listicles such as: “
[The top 10 Google searches of 2018”](https://www.businessinsider.com/top-google-searches-of-2018-2018-12) and [“10 burning questions Americans asked Google in 2018.”](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-year-in-search-how-to-trending-topics-2018-12) Business Insider reports news and opinions with the use of moderately loaded words such as this: “ [Trump inexplicably told Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi that Mexico would pay for the border wall as part of the landmark new trade deal](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-schumer-pelosi-shutdown-meeting-mexico-pay-for-wall-usmca-nafta-trade-deal-2018-12)” and “ [China looks like it’s going to give Trump a huge symbolic trade war win, fueling hope for a big deal](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-china-trade-war-made-in-china-2025-trump-win-2018-12).” When it comes to sourcing information, they utilize credible media sources such as gbm.hsbc.com, [brookings.edu](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [Council on Foreign Relations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-on-foreign-relations/), and asia.nikkei.com. However, we also found instances where they rely on poor sources such as the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/).
Politically, Business Insider leans left through both story selection and wording. Here are some examples of stories that have a leftward tilt:
[The odds that a gun will kill the average American may surprise you](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-gun-death-murder-risk-statistics-2018-3) [Mollie Tibbetts’ death used to push debunked ideas about illegal immigration and violent crime](https://www.businessinsider.com/undocumented-aliens-violent-crime-murder-statistics-data-2018-8) [Big oil companies were forced to lay out the science of climate change today in a court hearing that compared to the Scopes trial on evolution](https://www.businessinsider.com/oil-companies-climate-change-tutorial-in-court-2018-3) [Ocasio-Cortez burns Mike Huckabee after being mocked: ‘Leave the false statements to Sarah Huckabee. She’s much better at it.’](https://www.businessinsider.com/ocasio-cortez-burns-mike-huckabee-and-daughter-sarah-huckabee-2018-12)
This last story about Ocasio-Cortez and Mike Huckabee comes directly from the strongly left-leaning
