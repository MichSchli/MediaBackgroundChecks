Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered by journalists and with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[Did City of Utica violate its own zoning code](https://www.uticaod.com/news/20190913/did-city-of-utica-violate-its-own-zoning-code)? National news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and other Gannett-owned papers.
Editorially, the Utica Observer-Dispatch is mostly balanced with slight favoritism to the left.
