History
Founded in 2008, Bare Naked Islam is a news and opinion blog that focuses on the dangers of Islam. According to their
[about page](https://barenakedislam.com/about/), “This blog is designed to show you the dark side of Islam that the West does not want you to see. The Islam that Western media refuse to show you. Islam is slowly but surely changing the West. You may feel uncomfortable looking at this blog. You should. You will feel anger and disgust that our leaders do not understand Islam when it comes to the motives that drive our enemies to commit suicide for their ideology.”
The website does not list an editor nor the names of authors or ownership. The website also features the tagline: “It isn’t Islamophobia when they really ARE trying to kill you.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Bare Naked Islam is very clear in its purpose. They openly state that Islam is dangerous, and they try to prove it through publishing news that paints Muslims negatively. The wording of headlines and articles is frequently negative against Islam; however, they do not use overly strong emotional wording such as this:
[Did you know that Islamic jihadists have killed close to 150,000 people worldwide since 2000?](https://barenakedislam.com/2019/05/03/did-you-know-that-islamic-jihadists-have-killed-close-to-150000-people-worldwide-just-since-the-year-2000/) This information comes from the far-right biased [OAN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/). Essentially, Bare Naked Islam provides a short 1 sentence summary/opinion of a news story and then pastes or summarizes a snippet of a news story from a variety of sources. Some of the sources used come from our questionable lists, such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Daily Mail.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/)
According to the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), Bare Naked Islam is an [active hate group](https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/southern-poverty-law-center-lists-active-hate-groups-by-state) based in California.
