Analysis / Bias
Outside Online tends to have a left-leaning bias in their news and opinion articles, such as in the article:
[Biden Restores Three National Monuments Slashed by Trump, Including Bears Ears in Utah.”](https://www.outsideonline.com/business-journal/issues/biden-restores-three-national-monuments-slashed-by-trump-including-bears-ears-in-utah/) While positive language is used to describe President Biden’s actions, negative words like “slashed,” “significantly curtailed,” and “altered” are used to describe President Trump’s actions, indicating potential bias in favor of Biden’s decision to restore the monuments.
The article relies on quotes from various sources, including Utah’s congressional delegation, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, and the White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory, to provide insight into differing perspectives. Information from the Interior Department regarding the size reductions of the national monuments under the Trump administration is also referenced.
In another article, they are negative toward the former President:
[ “The Trump Presidency Is the Worst Ever for Public Lands.”](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/trump-presidency-public-lands-record/#_pay-wall) The language used in the article, such as ” threatened,” destroyed,” and ” degradation,” is negative and could suggest a bias against Trump’s administration. The article also cites factually mixed sources, such as the Center for American Progress, and credible sources, such as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Boem.gov, and alaskajournal.com, to provide evidence to support its claims.
