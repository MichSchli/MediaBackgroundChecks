Analysis / Bias
In review, Nation of Change provides a daily newsletter written from a progressive liberal perspective. The website features news stories that always favor the left and often uses moderately loaded language in their headlines and articles such as this:
[The Trump administration’s latest attempt to undermine science – and how to stop it](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/11/23/the-trump-administrations-latest-attempt-to-undermine-science-and-how-to-stop-it/). This story is sourced properly to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), Congress.gov, and the [National Academy of Sciences](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-academy-of-sciences-nas/).
Nation of Change frequently reports on the environment and takes a pro-science
[position](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) regarding [human-influenced climate change](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/11/23/it-wasnt-just-big-oil-that-knew-about-climate-change-decades-ago-new-report-reveals-coal-knew-too/). However, reporting on [GMOs](https://www.nationofchange.org/?s=gmo) is always [negative](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and does not always align with the consensus of science.
Editorially, Nation of Change favors left-leaning causes such as combating climate change, feminism, anti-corporate fascism, and social justice. They frequently report negatively on conservatives such as this:
[The 4 biggest conservative lies about inequality](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/07/09/the-4-biggest-conservative-lies-about-inequality/) and positively for socialism, [‘Socialism’ made America great](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/09/12/socialism-made-america-great/). In general, Nation of Change reports news factually from a far-left progressive perspective.
