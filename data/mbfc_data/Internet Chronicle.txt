History
[Founded in 2010](https://whois.domaintools.com/chronicle.su), the Internet Chronicle is a satire website as disclaimed on their [about page](https://chronicle.su/about/) here: “Sadly, chronicle.su is not of this earth. After crash landing in an asteroid December 30th, 1976, the alien husks of Chronicle editors rapidly adapted to Earth climates and bacterial flora. They are able to survive naturally in the wild and reproduce freely. Here at chronicle.su, we take a liberal stance on drug abuse and theft of intellectual property, but that does not mean we are liberal because liberals are faggots and I ain’t no steer-boatin’ queer! Receiving tweets twice daily via fax from religious advisers impregnates our right-wing furnace of hate, enabling us to bring you the most horrifyingly sensational headlines you’ve ever seen, or your money back – guaranteed!”
The domain for this source is .su, which stands for the Soviet Union, which no longer exists. Probably also satire.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the site makes clear they are a satire on their about page. A typical story reads
[Male feminists ‘transition’ to Black Lives Matter allies](https://chronicle.su/editorial/hate-editorial/male-feminists-transition-to-black-lives-matter-allies/). This is clearly a satire site.
