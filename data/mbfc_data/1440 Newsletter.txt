Analysis / Bias
In review, 1440 provides daily curated news stories that can be found on the website under “Digest” or delivered to your email by signing up for free. News and information are broken into categories that we will cover one by one. The first category is “Need to Know,” which provides 1 to 3 summarized news stories per day. These stories are generally the biggest stories and presented with minimal bias, such as this
[Defense Secretary Fired](https://join1440.com/newsletter/11-10-2020/). Like all others reviewed, this story is correctly sourced to credible outlets such as [Defense News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/defense-news/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/).
The next category is called “In the Know,” which has subcategories Sports, Entertainment, Culture, Science & Tech, Business & Markets, and Politics & World Affairs. Within this category, 1440 provides a one-sentence summary of the top stories in each subcategory and then provides offsite links to other sources covering the story. Our review of this category shows that they generally link to credible media outlets that range from Left-Center to Right-Center. The third category is called “In-Depth,” which links to longer analysis and editorial-type stories. A review of sources shows a reasonable balance with the Right-Leaning
[The Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-dispatch/) stories and the Left-Leaning [Wired Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/). The final category is called “ETCETERA,” which provides links to a variety of general interest stories such as “Lucky teens uncover a [1,100-year-old gold stash](https://news.join1440.com/t/j-l-ajltjik-irjhjliltt-ty/).” In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal editorializing.
