Analysis / Bias
Wide Awake Media offers articles that delve into conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. For example, articles discuss topics like the World Economic Forum’s
[‘Great Reset’](https://wide-awake-media.com/perfect-summary-of-wefs-great-reset-agenda-in-one-minute/) agenda and the role of global organizations in controlling various aspects of society. The language used in the articles is often emotionally charged and lacks credible sourcing.
The website also features content that is critical of mainstream narratives and often promotes conspiracy theories. For instance, one article claims that the plan is to “
[create vehicle rationing… and restrict our freedom of movement.](https://wide-awake-media.com/the-globalist-agenda-to-restrict-your-freedom-of-movement/)” Such statements are not supported by credible evidence and are indicative of a conspiratorial mindset.
Editorially, most stories favor the right with stories that denigrate the left and promote anti-science views such as this
