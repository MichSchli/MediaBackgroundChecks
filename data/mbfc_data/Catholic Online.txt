Analysis / Bias
Catholic Online has a strong right-wing bias through story selection in reporting news. For example, an article celebrates former President Trump’s decision to
[ban transgender](http://www.catholic.org/news/politics/story.php?id=75613) persons from the military, citing moral obligation. Another article reports about witches (liberals) gathering together to [put a spell on Trump](http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=73759). Further, this article cites the source [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/), which has a terrible track record with fact-checkers. Lastly, Catholic Online publishes far-right conspiracies such as Hillary Clinton being very sick and dying. Obviously, this is/was without evidence, as she is healthy today. In this same article, they also predicted that if Clinton had won the election, terrible things would happen to the USA, presumably by God.
Editorially, all stories favor the Christian Right, and at the time of this review, they are not fans of President Joe Biden
