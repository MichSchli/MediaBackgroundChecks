History
Founded in 2002 by author
[Robert W. Felix](https://www.iceagenow.info/about-the-author/), Ice Age Now is a website/blog designed to promote his book “Not by Fire but by Ice”, which claims an impending ice age is coming. The premise of the website is human-influenced global warming denialism. Not just Anthropogenic (humans) Global Warming, but all global warming. Mr. Felix claims the earth is cooling right now and will continue to do so until the poles shift or through other natural processes. It should be noted that Robert Felix is a [former architect and not a climate scientist](https://www.iceagenow.info/about-the-author/) or actually a scientist at all.

Funded by / Ownership
Ice Age Now does not disclose ownership, but it is assumed it is owned by Robert W. Felix. Revenue is derived from advertising, donations and sales of his book and DVD’s. In the past Mr. Felix has been a
[co-sponsor](https://web.archive.org/web/20090318014550/http://www.heartland.org/events/NewYork09/PDFs/NY09Program.pdf) at the International Conference on Climate that is sponsored by the Questionable [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/), which promotes human-influenced climate change denialism and is [funded](https://www.desmogblog.com/closer-look-heartland-s-iccc7-denial-palooza-speakers-and-sponsors) by the fossil fuel industry. We are not saying Mr. Felix was funded by them, but he was a co-sponsor and speaker at an event that was.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Ice Age Now is a blog that promotes AGW denialism and climate cooling. One of the frequent scenarios presented is pole reversal, which Mr. Felix speculates could to lead to an ice age:
[So what if the Earth’s magnetic North Pole reverses? – Video](https://www.iceagenow.info/so-what-if-the-earths-magnetic-north-pole-reverses-video/). In the pamphlet for the 2009 International Conference on Climate Change, Ice Age Now described themselves as: “Our climate is driven by natural cycles, not by humans. We fear that one of those cycles – the [Milankovitch Cycle](https://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/Milankovitch) – is leading us into the next ice age right now. We also fear that this nonsense about ‘global warming’ will leave us blindsided and unprepared.”
The website also frequently publishes news stories about cold weather events around the world such as this:
[Up to a foot of snow possible in Mt Rainier summit, Washington](https://www.iceagenow.info/up-to-a-foot-of-snow-possible-in-mt-rainier-summit-washington/) and [Moscow possibly on track for coldest August on record](https://www.iceagenow.info/moscow-possibly-on-track-for-coldest-august-on-record/). While this information is true, local and regional weather anomalies cannot be attributed to global warming or cooling. However, if you want to examine properly and look globally, you will find that there have been [35 heat records broken vs 2 for cold so far in 2019](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2192369-so-far-2019-has-set-35-records-for-heat-and-2-for-cold/). Lastly, Ice Age Now promotes conspiracy theories such as climate change being a means to destroy the economy and move towards socialism: [It’s about destroying the entire economy](https://www.iceagenow.info/its-about-destroying-the-entire-economy/).
