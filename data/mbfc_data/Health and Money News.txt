Analysis / Bias
In review, Health and Money News is a blog that publishes far-right conspiracies and pseudoscience. During the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, they have routinely promoted false information such as mask use being related to cancer
[That Mask Is Giving You Lung Cancer?](https://healthandmoneynews.wordpress.com/2020/10/24/that-mask-is-giving-you-lung-cancer/) This story is not properly sourced to credible scientific information and is actually [false](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-masks-cause-cancer/fact-checkwearing-masksdoes-notcause-cancer-idUSKBN26Q22N). When not promoting [mask denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/), they also promote unsourced information related to the dangers of the Covid-19 test [Nurse Practitioner: COVID TEST IS DANGEROUS FRAUD](https://healthandmoneynews.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/nurse-practitioner-covid-test-is-dangerous-fraud/). In another article, [they claim](https://healthandmoneynews.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/fox-news-corona-virus-false-alarm/) “There is zero science behind Lockdown, social distancing, [Vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), and mandatory masking are not necessary.” This information comes from a disreputable Doctor who was interviewed on Laura Ingraham’s [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) program. In short, according to the website, all the measures necessary to combat Covid-19 are dangerous and deadly, but the actual disease, which to date has killed more than 280K Americans, is a harmless hoax or conspiracy theory. In general, Health and Money News is a source that has zero credibility and is very dangerous if taken seriously, as virtually every bit of information we reviewed was either false or purposely misleading.
