History
[Founded in 2016](http://whois.domaintools.com/gellerreport.com), the Geller Report is the personal blog/website of Pamela Geller, who is [best known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Geller) for her Anti-Islamic writings. According to her [about page](https://gellerreport.com/about/): “Pamela Geller is the founder, editor, and publisher of The Geller Report and President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) and Stop Islamization of America (SIOA). She is a foremost defender of the freedom of speech against attempts to force the West to accept Sharia blasphemy laws and against Sharia self-censorship by Western media outlets.”
The
[American Freedom Defense Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Islamization_of_America) is an anti-Muslim, pro-Israel American organization known primarily for its controversial, Islamophobic advertising campaigns. The group has been described as extremist and far-right. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists SIOA as an [anti-Muslim hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/anti-muslim).
In 2010, Pamela Geller began a controversial
[campaign](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/20/rightwing-blogs-islam-america) to stop the construction of a mosque at the 9-11 ground zero site. In 2015, Ms. Geller proposed a [drawing contest of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/04/21/well-known-isis-operative-instructed-americans-to-kill-organizer-of-muhammad-cartoon-contest-prosecutors-reveal/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.bce70b710305), which is forbidden in Islam. This subsequently led to calls for Ms. Geller’s beheading. In 2017, David Wright, a Massachusetts man, was [sentenced to 28 years in prison](https://www.newsweek.com/isis-supporter-david-wright-plot-kill-pamela-geller-take-down-us-government-752450) for plotting to behead Geller, whom the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) had urged its global support base to kill.

Analysis / Bias
The Geller Report (GR) is a right-wing source run by Pamela Geller. GR is more of a personal blog than an actual news source, parroting the most
[extreme rhetoric of the right](https://gellerreport.com/2018/06/geller-internet-thought-police.html/) in general and anti-Muslim sentiment in particular. There is no attempt at factual reporting or presenting opposing views in the stories, and they are heavily biased in their wording and content. The sources GR uses in the stories are either from other extreme sources or misrepresented. For the heavy bias and extremism, Geller Report is rated Questionable. (D. Kelley 6/19/2017)
The Geller Report frequently uses loaded language in its headlines:
[Pamela Geller, Breitbart: CPAC Joins the Leftist Social Media Giants in Censoring Conservatives.](https://gellerreport.com/2018/02/cpac-censors.html/) The Geller Report typically publishes articles that Ms. Geller writes for other publications, such as the questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/), and the Alt-Right blog of Milo Yiannopoulos, called [Dangerous](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dangerous/).
In general, the Geller Report routinely publishes highly negative stories against Islam. Ms. Geller has been
[called](https://news.yahoo.com/anti-jihad-savage-ads-going-nyc-subway-220228596.html) an anti-Muslim bigot and racist by [Muneer Awad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muneer_Awad) of the [Council on American-Islamic Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations). She has been labeled an “ [Anti-Islam Extremist](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/pamela-geller)” by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) and “ [exhibiting anti-Muslim bigotry](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/10/l-i-synagogue-cancels-controversial-pamela-geller-speech/)” by the [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/). Geller has dismissed the SPLC as an “uber left” organization. Finally, during the coronavirus and the Presidential election of 2020, they have published false and misleading information (see failed fact checks).
