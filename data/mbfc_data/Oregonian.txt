Analysis / Bias
In review, The Oregonian covers local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Dispute over caregiver led to fatal shooting in Vancouver senior living tower, police say](https://www.oregonlive.com/clark-county/2019/10/dispute-over-caregiver-led-to-fatal-vancouver-shooting-in-senior-living-tower.html). National and international news is derived from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and occasionally the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). All information is properly sourced.
Editorially, The Oregonian had a long history of endorsing Republican candidates; however, in
[2020](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2020/10/editorial-endorsements-2020-voting-early-our-endorsements-for-the-november-election.html), they endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden and several Democrats for local office. Finally, in [2022](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/04/editorial-endorsements-may-2022-our-editorial-boards-voting-recommendations.html), they endorsed a mix of right and left candidates. A review of their [opinion page](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/) shows a reasonable balance of opinions. In general, The Oregonian reports news factually and responsibly with minimal bias.
