Analysis / Bias
In review, The Spectator primarily covers politics and culture with a right-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines and articles usually contain moderately loaded language that favors the right such as this:
[Theresa May’s Brexit strategy has humiliated Britain](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/03/theresa-mays-brexit-strategy-has-humiliated-britain/) and this [Cambridge’s shameful decision to rescind Jordan Peterson’s visiting fellowship.](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/03/cambridges-shameful-decision-to-rescind-jordan-petersons-visiting-fellowship/) Information contained in articles is typically properly sourced to credible media outlets or via direct quotes. The Spectator has also [published misleading articles](https://climatefeedback.org/outlet/the-spectator/) regarding climate change.
Editorially, The Spectator is generally
[Eurosceptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism) in outlook, favoring close ties with the United States rather than with the European Union and supporting Israel. In British politics, they are generally strongly opposed to the Labour Party and favor the Conservative Party and are often critical of Conservative Party Prime Minister Theresa May for not being strong enough on Brexit.
