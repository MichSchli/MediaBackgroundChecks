Analysis
BOOMLIVE republishes
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) fact checks regarding world-related news such as this [Dr Sherri Tenpenny Repeats COVID-19 Misinfo In Ohio State Testimony](https://www.boomlive.in/world/dr-sherri-tenpenny-repeats-covid-19-misinfo-in-ohio-state-testimony-13570).

Other stories focus on investment advice, which reflects the opinions of the authors [Build Your Portfolio By Eliminating Bad Stocks: Samir Arora](https://www.boomlive.in/boom-money/safe-investing/samir-arora-stock-market-investment-tips-sensex-nifty-11383).
Bias
Editorially, BOOMLIVE fact-checks opposition politicians’ claims such as
[“Mamata Banerjee Repeats False Claim About Locket Chatterjee’s Car Window”](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/mamata-banerjee-repeats-false-claim-about-locket-chatterjees-car-window-12782) and the Right-Leaning Prime Minister Modi government-related facts such as [“Photo Of PM Modi Bowing To Nita Ambani Is Morphed](https://www.boomlive.in/fact-check/fake-news-narendra-modi-nita-ambani-viral-image-modi-bowing-to-ambani-photoshopped-factcheck-13435).” However, many of the fact-checks are debunking claims made against PM Modi.
Regarding the PM Modi Government, according to an Atlantic
[article,](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/amitabh-bachchan-india-coronavirus/615310/) Modi is said to be “promoting pseudoscientific methods over modern medicine.” Another report from [The Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/) states, “ [Modi allies peddling ‘dung therapy’ for virus.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/modi-allies-peddling-dung-therapy-for-virus-gkqcvwj3t)” BOOMLIVE fact-checked this claim under the title [“Can Cow Urine Or Gaumutra Cure Coronavirus? What We Know.”](https://www.boomlive.in/factcheck/can-cow-urine-or-gaumutra-cure-coronavirus-what-we-know-7308) However, they only lightly mention that PM Modi does not dispute the practice. The AFP reports in this [article](https://www.france24.com/en/20201013-no-bull-india-claims-cow-dung-chip-protects-against-radiation) that it may be due to PM Modi’s promotion and spending on pseudoscience “Since coming to power in 2014, Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party has earmarked millions of dollars for research into products using cow dung and urine.”
In general, BOOMLIVE provides accurate, evidence-based fact checks; however, they seem to be reluctant to fact-check the right-leaning Prime Minister Modi directly.
