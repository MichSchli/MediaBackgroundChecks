Analysis / Bias
In our review of content from “Education Next,” we’ve analyzed several articles to identify potential biases and framing. First, The article
[“The Stubborn Myth of “Learning Styles”](https://www.educationnext.org/stubborn-myth-learning-styles-state-teacher-license-prep-materials-debunked-theory/) by William Furey, published under the research section, critically examines the widely accepted concept of “learning styles.” Furey’s choice of words, such as “stubborn” and “debunked,” underscores his skepticism towards the validity of this educational theory.
The article, published in the Summer 2020 issue of “Education Next,” highlights the inconsistency in how the “learning styles” concept is presented in educational materials despite academic reservations. The formal citation and Furey’s academic position lend credibility to the article’s argument against belief in “learning styles.”
Next, The article
[“Critical Race Theory Collides with the Law”](https://www.educationnext.org/critical-race-theory-collides-with-law/) seems to lean towards a skeptical view of CRT, especially in its framing and word choice. The article outlines both the school’s defense and Clark’s allegations. However, the emphasis on Clark’s detailed complaints might overshadow the school’s arguments. While the school’s defense is briefly mentioned, it’s quickly countered by Clark’s attorneys, potentially giving Clark’s perspective more prominence. This can be interpreted as a right-leaning bias, aligning with conservative CRT critiques. The emphasis on legal challenges and potential unconstitutionality further underscores this perspective.”
Lastly, an article titled
[School Choice Advances in the States](https://www.educationnext.org/school-choice-advances-in-states-advocates-describe-breakthrough-year/), subtitled ‘Advocates describe “breakthrough year,”‘ offers a detailed overview of school choice advancements. The framing and word choices subtly lean towards a pro-school choice stance. While it does present the views of opponents, the framing and word choices occasionally cast these opposing views in a negative or confrontational light. The title itself, ‘It’s been a breakthrough year for school choice,’ sets a positive tone for the advancements in school choice. For instance, the article states, ‘The momentum behind school choice is undeniable,’ reinforcing the notion of widespread acceptance. Another example is, ‘Teachers in West Virginia…vowed to punish their enemies,’ portraying teachers’ opposition in a combative light.
School choice is a stance often backed by the Republican party. The article ‘School Choice Advances in the States,’ with its positive view on school choice, suggests a right-leaning bias.
