Analysis / Bias
Hawar News Agency rarely sources their news pieces, and in some cases, they use questionable sources.
[According to a Pro-Syrian opposition source, Verify-by Hawar News is affiliated with the Democratic Union Party (PYD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawar_News_Agency), and by affiliation, they have a strong left-wing bias. Further, they indicate rumors as to their source under the analysis headline such as this: “ [There are changes in Aleppo, Idleb, and Hama](http://en.hawarnews.com/there-are-changes-in-aleppo-idleb-and-hama/).” Hawar News Agency uses strong loaded language in both sensational headlines and articles; therefore, we rate Hawar News Agency as mixed for factual reporting, and a questionable propaganda website with extreme left bias.
