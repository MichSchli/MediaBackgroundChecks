Analysis / Bias
The Boston Broadside uses emotionally loaded words in its news reporting, such as
[“We Print What Fox News and The Mega Media Hide!”](https://www.bostonbroadside.com/frontpage/december2020/) and [“Stop The Steal – Bourne Bridge Standout – Sat. 11/21/2020.](https://www.bostonbroadside.com/voterfraud/stop-the-steal-bourne-bridge-standout-sat-11-21-2020/)” Furthermore, The Boston Broadside pushes conspiracies about COVID, the Jan 6 Riot, and 2020 election fraud, such as [“Ongoing Safety Concerns With COVID-19 Vaccines,”](https://www.bostonbroadside.com/vaccine/covidconcerns/) a quote from the article reads, “There’s no way to know how this RNA programming might affect your health in years to come. Possible unintended effects over the long term include autoimmune, endocrine and neurological disorders and infertility.” There is [no evidence](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-mrna-megamix-idUSL1N2M61HW) to support that vaccines change your DNA.
In another
[article](https://www.bostonbroadside.com/voterfraud/rally-2/), the author claims that The Rioters weren’t Trump supporters, as the quote from the article reads, “They had a nice, peaceful rally, unlike the BLM burnings last year. Then, a fraction of the people walked to Congress. Then, for an unknown reason, a few crazy folks got into the building.” This is one of [many conspiracies](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot) associated with the Capitol Riot.
The Boston Broadside also spreads misinformation about the 2020 elections, such as
[“Mike Lindell: Colorado- Criminal Election Violations.”](https://www.bostonbroadside.com/voterfraud/mike-lindell-colorado-criminal-election-violations/) Mike Lindell frequently fails fact checks and is not a [credible source](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/). Regarding sourcing, The Boston Broadside occasionally sources; when they do, it is typically from a questionable source such as [The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/). In general, they report news and editorialize with a strong right-leaning bias. They also promote propaganda through misinformation to support a conservative agenda.
