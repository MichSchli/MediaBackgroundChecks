History
Founded in 2002, FreedomProject Media is a website that features conservative video shows, podcasts, and text-based news. The website does not contain an about page; however, a domain search indicates FreedomProject.com was registered in 2002 to the
[John Birch Society](http://whois.domaintools.com/freedomproject.com).
FreedomProject Media is connected to the
[FreedomProject Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreedomProject_Academy), which is a private, online, Judeo-Christian school for students from kindergarten through high school that teaches from a Classical Christian education perspective. FPA is a school, not a self-paced program or tutorial service. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
FreedomProject Media does not disclose ownership on the website; however, the FreedomProject Academy is managed by FreedomProject Education, which is owned by the
[American Opinion Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Opinion_Foundation&action=edit&redlink=1), a 501(c)(3) organization with ties to the [John Birch Society](https://www.americanopinionfoundation.org/aof-board). Revenue appears to be derived from donations.
Analysis / Bias
This review will focus on text-based articles found on the website. FreedomProject Media reports news and opinions with a strong right-wing bias in story selection and wording. For example, this story contains strong loaded language,
[California Pushes K-12 Sex Ed Indoctrination That Will Blow Your Mind.](https://freedomproject.com/the-newman-report/1097-california-pushes-k-12-sex-ed-indoctrination-that-will-blow-your-mind) The story primarily sources back to older articles on their own website. However, they provide outside links to the Conspiracy-Pseudoscience [Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-broadcasting-network-cbn/) and the Anti-LGBT Family Research Institute, which is classified as an active [Hate Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184613/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp?S=CO&m=5) in the USA.
Stories generally revolve around education and how liberal education is destroying morality. They frequently promote a far-right Christian agenda such as anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, and pretty much anything left of right-center. They also promote baseless conspiracy theories like this:
[Snopes Defends Teaching Child Rape to Children](https://freedomproject.com/the-newman-report/1093-snopes-defends-teaching-child-rape-to-children). Further, FreedomProject has been [accused](https://www.splcenter.org/20140430/public-schools-crosshairs-far-right-propaganda-and-common-core-state-standards) of promoting Far-Right Propaganda regarding Common Core State Standards and [climate change](https://www.freedomproject.com/2022/11/10/edu43/).
