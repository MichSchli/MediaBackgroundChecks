Analysis / Bias
Stew Peters, a far-right radio host with a history of advancing COVID-19 conspiracy theories, is the producer of “Died Suddenly.” In his previous movie, “Watch the Water,” the radio host claimed that the coronavirus is a synthetic snake venom spread through COVID-19 vaccines and drinking water.
[Politifact rated this claim as pants on fire](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/19/watch-water/stew-peters-film-watch-water-ridiculously-claims-c/).
The website does not present text-based news, only hosting the 78-minute video. In Died Suddenly, Peters continues promoting debunked conspiracy theories and pseudoscience related to Covid-19 and the vaccines.
[The film’s general theme](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/nov/29/died-suddenly-repeats-debunked-covid-19-vaccine-cl/) is that “COVID-19 vaccines are part of a depopulation scheme by global elites who want to establish a global regime.” Further, the video relies on unreliable sources such as [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), Dr. Robert Malone, and other alternative health advocates.
In general, DiedSuddenly.info advances debunked conspiracy theories and impossible pseudoscience (see failed fact checks). For a detailed account of all the disinformation contained in this film, please see here:
