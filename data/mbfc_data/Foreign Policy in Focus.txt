Analysis / Bias
In review, Foreign Policy In Focus publishes well-sourced analysis from credible left-leaning media such as
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Boston Globe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-globe/), [NYTimes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [HuffPost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), [Right Web](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right-web/), and [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/). Although they do utilize loaded language in their headlines and articles such as “ [Trump’s Enablers Should Be Shamed Out of Public Life,”](http://fpif.org/trumps-enablers-shamed-public-life/) they also use similar language towards Democrats: “ [Clinton’s State Department overlooked human rights abuses and corruption while keeping a lucrative flow of contracts moving to U.S. security firms working in Mexico.](http://fpif.org/hillary-clintons-dark-drug-war-legacy-mexico/)” And former President Obama: “ [Trump Plans to Make It Easier to Kill Civilians with Drones. Sadly, We Can Thank Obama for That.](http://fpif.org/trump-plans-make-easier-kill-civilians-drones-sadly-can-thank-obama/)”
In general, they are fact-based and offer left-leaning editorial positions.
