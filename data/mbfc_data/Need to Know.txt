[G. Edward Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Edward_Griffin), an author and filmmaker who has made many false claims. In his books, G. Edward Griffin claims that cancer is a nutritional deficiency that can be cured by consuming amygdalin, which is regarded as [quackery by the medical community](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/).
