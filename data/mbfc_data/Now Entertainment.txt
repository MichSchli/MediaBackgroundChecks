Analysis / Bias
Now Entertainment primarily publishes entertainment news and reviews, with most articles focused on music. Articles and headlines do not use loaded emotional language and often reports on new music releases such as
[The Shadowboxers – ‘Something To Hold](https://www.nowentertainment.net/the-shadowboxers-something-to-hold/).’ The website also features low-biased interviews such as this [Tristan Barrett: Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in](https://www.nowentertainment.net/tristan-barrett-top-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in/). All articles reviewed are properly sourced.
Editorially, owner Tony M. Fountain tells MBFC that he holds moderate “conservative/libertarian views;” however, the website also publishes stories that are favorable to the left, such as this
[Eirliani Rahman is on a mission to help provide children in Delhi with a safe place during the COVID-19 lockdown.](https://www.nowentertainment.net/eirliani/?fbclid=IwAR2Fm1o9WZp_POWVzkDfbBVV9sQ8e1cA9sZLqo1I8ljzHaCORfaWCOVaDkI) Currently, politically themed news is on a subdomain and in the process of being moved to the nowentertainment.net domain. We will re-review this source at a later date when more political commentary is available. In general, Now Entertainment publishes fact-based content that holds a self-described right-leaning bias.
