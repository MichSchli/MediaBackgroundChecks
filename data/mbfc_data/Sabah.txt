In 2000, Dinç Bilgin sold Sabah to MTM Group (Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, Murat Vargı, Turgay Ciner). In 2007, Turkey’s Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF)
[seized ](http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/media/detail/outlet/sabah/)Sabah and the ATV group due to bankruptcy. In 2008, the group was renamed Turkuaz Medya and Çalık Group when [acquired](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/turkish-media-company-sale-raises-eyebrows-8769903) by [Turkuvaz Media Group](http://www.turkuvazmedyayayhiz.com/BilgiToplumuHizmetleri/yonetim-kurulu-1520847571).

Analysis / Bias
The current president and former prime minister of Turkey are
[Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/biography/), who describes himself as [a conservative Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan).
The media in Turkey is currently separated into two groups. Pro-government media is called the
[“pool media,”](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/murat-yetkin/the-new-media-disorder-in-turkey-82654) and the other is called the opposition media. Sabah is considered to be in the pool media after it was sold to [Kalyon Group](https://kalyongrup.com/Anasayfa?aspxerrorpath=/en-us/homepage.aspx), which is closely related to the AKP party and President Erdogan.
In review, Sabah publishes picture heavy articles with strong emotionally loaded language such as this
[“Türkiye’nin maskeleri için sıraya girdiler.](https://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2020/05/07/turkiyenin-maskeleri-icin-siraya-girdiler) Sabah rarely uses hyperlinks, and when they do it is circular in nature. When covering national news Sabah publishes articles with a pro-government tone [“Erdoğan İslam dünyasının lideri”](https://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2020/02/15/erdogan-islam-dunyasinin-lideri) and tabloid style listicles [“Dünyanın en güzel 100 kadını! Listede 5 Türk var”.](https://www.sabah.com.tr/galeri/dunya/dunyanin-en-guzel-100-kadini-listede-5-turk-var-1517998580/21)
When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a positive tone, such as
[“Trump: “Çin, yeni tip koronavirüsü kasten ortaya çıkarmadı.””](https://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2020/05/05/son-dakika-trump-cin-yeni-tip-koronavirusu-kasten-ortaya-cikarmadi) In general, Sabah is a tabloid-like paper that promotes pro-government propaganda.
