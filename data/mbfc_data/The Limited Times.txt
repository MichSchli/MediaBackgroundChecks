History
[NewsRND.com](https://whois.domaintools.com/newsrnd.com) (The Limited Times) is a news aggregator covering various topics, including politics, sports, tech, and life. The website lacks transparency as they do not have an about page or disclose its location and ownership.
Funded by / Ownership
Ownership of NewsRND.com is not specified, and advertisements generate revenue. Another website called the
[Teller Report](https://www.tellerreport.com/) has a similar look and the same tagline, “Now you can see Non-English News,” indicating the same person or company may own them.
Analysis / Bias
NewsRND republishes articles from various sources, including those that may have different levels of factual reporting and bias. For example, it republished an article from Le Parisien titled
[“Tennis: ‘He raped me three times a day,’ the terrible testimony of Angélique Cauchy.”](https://newsrnd.com/sports/2023-09-06-tennis--%22he-raped-me-three-times-a-day%22--the-terrible-testimony-of-ang%C3%A9lique-cauchy.BJI7YeQI02.html) The article contains emotionally charged words like “terrible,” “chilling,” and “ordeal.” Given the sensitive and serious nature of the topic, such wording may be appropriate to convey the gravity of the situation. The article cites a previous report from Franceinfo and includes quotes from Angélique Cauchy’s testimony, adding credibility to the information presented.
Another article analyzed,
[“Oise: in the run-up to the Olympics, the disabled sports committee expects “a lot of requests for registration.”](https://newsrnd.com/news/2023-06-20-oise--in-the-run-up-to-the-olympics--the-disabled-sports-committee-expects-%22a-lot-of-requests-for-registration%22.rkW7cl1dh.html) was also republished from Le Parisien. The headline seems straightforward and does not contain biased wording.
Lastly, NewsRND republishes

In general, NewsRND republishes news from a wide variety of sources, some of which may not always be factual. Further, its complete lack of transparency lowers its credibility level.
