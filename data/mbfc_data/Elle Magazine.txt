Analysis / Bias
In review, Elle typically covers fashion and entertainment. Politics is not heavily covered, however when they do, they use moderate emotionally loaded wording such as this
[“’Black People Will Swim’ Is Fighting A Racist Stereotype With Swim Lessons”.](https://www.elle.com/culture/a32957355/black-people-will-swim-paulana-lamonier/) This story, like most on the website, is properly sourced to High and Mostly Factual left-leaning sources such as [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/atlanta-journal-constitution/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and [Out Magazine.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/out-magazine/) However, they also publish articles such as [“How Much For That Queerness In The Window?”,](https://www.elle.com/culture/a28068790/pride-brands-rainbow-merch-review/) which directs to market affiliated brands that are weaved into the article and provides links indirectly encouraging readers to buy products such as “like the cute Express Pride black tank with rainbow ribbing and the understated gray J. Crew Pride ‘Love First’ shirt.” They do disclaim with a note “Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn a commission on some of the items you choose to buy.”
Editorially, Elle Magazine does not report favorably on conservatives and the Trump administration such as this: “
[Trump Is Autographing Bibles Now So That’s A Wrap On Humanity, Right?”](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a26767569/trump-autograph-bible/) A quote from the article reads “President of the United States and Professional Twitter Bully, spent some time in Alabama today greeting people and autographing items, among them hats, $100 bills, and Bibles. As in The Bible.” Further, Elle [occasionally](https://www.elle.com/beauty/health-fitness/g22594459/best-essential-oils/) promotes [ pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-essential-oils/), such as [aromatherapy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-aroma-therapy/). Although they do source to credible pro-science sites, the article’s claims do not match the consensus of science that aromatherapy is not [scientifically proven](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/doterra-multilevel-marketing-of-essential-oils/) to be effective. They have also been [criticized](https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/news/a23512/gmo-food-debate/) for an article about [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) called “Bad Seed.” In general, Elle reports mostly factually and with a strong left-leaning bias.
