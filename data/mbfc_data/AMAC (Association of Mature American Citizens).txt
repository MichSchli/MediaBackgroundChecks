History
[Founded](https://amac.us/about-us) in 2007, AMAC (The Association of Mature American Citizens) is a US-based interest group, which [describes](https://amac.us/amac-alternative-aarp/) itself as the conservative alternative to AARP (the American Association of Retired Persons). The Association of Mature American Citizens, or AMAC, is [based](https://www.wsj.com/articles/aarp-faces-competition-from-conservative-leaning-groups-1394667995) in Lady Lake, Florida. [Daniel C. Weber](https://amacfoundation.org/about/) is the founder of AMAC, and on his [bio page](https://amac.us/amac-founder/), he describes himself as “A devoted advocate of free enterprise.” He refers to AMAC “as a way to unite citizens to defend our American way of life.” A quote from the FAQ page regarding the organization’s purpose is stated as “other major 50+ organizations were too liberal and did not represent his views. Rather than do nothing, Weber decided to begin his own organization. AMAC is a conservative, non-partisan organization representing those whose core beliefs are not represented by other major 50+ organizations.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, AMAC is essentially a conservative version of AARP that boasts over 1 million members. The website indicates their conservative
[political positions](https://amac.us/about-us/our-stance-on-the-issues/), such as support for the 2nd Amendment, Small Government, Fiscal Responsibility, Religious Freedom, Pro-Life, Low Taxes, and Repeal Obamacare. Besides promoting their agenda, they also republish news with loaded emotional headlines such as this: [Portland Is the New Berkeley: “Occupy ICE” and Antifa Mayhem](https://amac.us/portland-is-the-new-berkeley-occupy-ice-and-antifa-mayhem/) and this: [Will the FEC Please Stand Up — and Hold Hillary Clinton Accountable?](https://amac.us/will-the-fec-please-stand-up-and-hold-hillary-clinton-accountable/)
Republished articles tend to come from strongly right-leaning sources such as the
[New American](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-new-american/) and [Inside Sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/insidesources/). AMAC also publishes original content that again utilizes loaded language such as this: [Courts Say Protestors Can Disrespect The Flag, But You Don’t Need a Court Order To Salute The ‘Grand Old Flag,’ says AMAC](https://amac.us/courts-say-protestors-can-disrespect-the-flag-but-you-dont-need-a-court-order-to-salute-the-grand-old-flag-says-amac/). This article is properly sourced from credible information and media sources. This source does not align with the consensus on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) when it comes to science. AMAC publishes strongly right-leaning conservative news and sometimes uses poor sources.
