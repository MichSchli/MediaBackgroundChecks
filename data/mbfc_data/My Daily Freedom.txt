Analysis / Bias
In review, My Daily Freedom covers news and politics from a right-leaning conservative perspective. News is not originally reported but instead summarized with additional conservative commentary added. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded language, such as this
[Joe Biden is the ‘whiner-in-chief’ who’s been ‘missing in action all of these years: Sean Hannity](https://mydailyfreedom.com/sean-hannity-biden-missing/) This story is sourced from a video clip from Right-Wing Talk show host [Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sean-hannity-bias-rating/).
A review of story selection shows that all favor the right and tend to denigrate the left. Regarding sourcing, they generally rely on video clips that connect to mostly credible sources such as
[CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), but sometimes they utilize sources that frequently fail fact checks, such as [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/). My Daily Freedom generally reports with a strong right-leaning bias and sometimes promotes misleading claims. For example, they published a story with the headline, [Howard Caplan Asks Joe Biden Why He Molested All Those Girls](https://trendingviews.co/video/howard-caplan-asks-joe-biden-why-he-molested-all-those-girls-2305.html). To date, there isn’t any evidence to implicate Joe Biden.
