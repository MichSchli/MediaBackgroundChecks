Analysis / Bias
In review, American Military News’ reporting on national security and the US military utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines. Articles such as
[AZ man get 12 years for helping college students join ISIS](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2018/12/az-man-gets-12-years-for-helping-college-student-join-isis/) or [Trump to withdraw half of 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, reports say](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2018/12/trump-to-withdraw-half-of-14000-us-troops-in-afghanistan-reports-say/). Both of these stories are properly sourced to credible media outlets. Besides original content, American Military News also curates and republishes military-related news from other credible sources such as [Stars and Stripes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stars-and-stripes/) (Least Biased), [Hindustan Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hindustan-times/) (Left-Center), [San Diego Union-Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-diego-union-tribune/) (Least Biased), [Roll Call](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/roll-call/) (Least Biased), and [Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-europe-radio-liberty/) (Least Biased).
American Military News also has a reasonably balanced opinion page; however, more op-eds favor the right, such as this
[Study: Obama’s TEVUS crime database hides BLM, ANTIFA violence and inflates white, right-wing violence](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2020/11/study-obamas-tevus-crime-database-hides-blm-antifa-violence-and-inflates-white-right-wing-violence/). In general, most stories are factual and hold a right-leaning editorial bias.
