History
True Pundit is a political conspiracy website with a far right-wing bias. Like most low credibility sources they do not list a mission statement or about page.

Funded by / Ownership
Again, True Pundit does not list ownership or financial information, however, Thomas Paine (real name
[Michael D. Moore](https://www.metro.us/news/true-pundit-unmasked-as-former-journalist-michael-d-moore)) appears as the name on many articles. This is a [pseudonym](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/revealed-notorious-pro-trump-misinformation-site-true) for a supposed former FBI agent who is now against the FBI and very pro-Trump. It appears this is his website that is funded through advertising and donations via Pay Pal and Patreon.
Analysis / Bias
True Pundit occasionally publishes a legitimate story, however, most are right-wing
[conspiracies](http://truepundit.com/americans-worry-over-us-ascendancy-in-new-world-order/). The majority of articles from True Pundit have anonymous authors and all of them have a strong right-wing bias with generally loaded headlines such as [The FBI Just Kicked the Door in of Anti-Trump San Juan Mayor’s Office in Puerto Rico; Federal Raid](https://truepundit.com/the-fbi-just-kicked-the-door-in-of-anti-trump-san-juan-mayors-office-in-puerto-rico-federal-raid/). True Pundit continues to beat the [Seth Rich Murder conspiracy](https://truepundit.com/watch-joe-rogan-podcast-gets-heated-talking-seth-rich-murder/) to death, no pun intended, and several other conspiracies that have been debunked. True Pundit also uses Questionable sources such as [Your News Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/your-news-wire/), which has one of the [worst fact checking records in history](https://www.poynter.org/news/fact-checkers-have-debunked-fake-news-site-80-times-its-still-publishing-facebook).
