Analysis / Bias
Le Journal de Montréal
[often republishes](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2021/05/21/journee-nationale-des-patriotes-ouvert-ou-ferme) stories from the QMI Agency, which is also owned by the Journal de Montreal‘s publisher, Quebecor Inc., and from [credible news agencies](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/auteur/afp) such as [AFP (Agence France Presse).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) Articles and headlines contain emotionally loaded headlines such as [“Another crowded beach in Montreal. Hundreds of revelers flouted sanitary rules by gathering at the water’s edge without distancing.”](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2021/05/22/une-autre-plage-bondee-a-montreal) Many stories reviewed contain sensationalized headlines.
Editorially, the paper frequently favors the right. For example, they report positively on conservatism and liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau negatively. For instance, the headline
[reads in French in this story:](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/media-stigma-journal-de-montreal-trudeau-legault-1.5997749) “The Indian variant is here.” The article features a picture of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Indian dress taken during his 2018 trip to India and followed by an editorial about COVID-19. Politicians and media outlets have condemned Le Journal de Montréal’s headline and photo.
Further, Le Journal de Montreal has been accused of promoting
[Quebec Nationalism](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/12/23/qfre-d23.html). For example, they support [Simon Jolin-Barrette](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2021/05/14/simon-jolin-barrette-lheritier), a part of the conservative [Coalition Avenir Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Avenir_Qu%C3%A9bec) promoting immigration restrictions and Quebec Nationalism. They generally report the news mostly factually and with a right-leaning nationalist bias. Finally, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 67% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/canada) and 14% do not, ranking them #7 in trust among the major French-language Canadian news providers.
