You can follow the money from the Congressional appropriations to the federal agencies and down to local communities and businesses.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, USAspending.gov was created in response to The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (S. 2590), which was an Act of Congress that requires the full disclosure to the public of all entities or organizations receiving federal funds beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2007. It continues to maintain its website as of this review in November 2022.
The sole purpose of the website is to be transparent to the public on how much and where the money is being spent by the Government. For example, in 2019, they revealed that the government spent $4.45 trillion and, of that, collected $3.5 trillion in revenue for a deficit of close to 1 trillion. Long story short, this is a source of statistics on how much the government spends and collects in tax revenue.
