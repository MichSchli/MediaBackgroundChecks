Analysis / Bias
Joe Romm describes the website as an “antidote” to the
[Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/). He states to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/450079-former-fox-news-reporter-says-he-left-because-of-partisan-misinformation), “But whereas Drudge aggregates and viralizes right-wing content, which includes a lot of disinformation and climate science denial, we will aim to aggregate and viralize accurate news.”
In review, Front Page Live covers news via hashtags. For example, the hashtags during this review are #ViralNow, #2020race, #ClimateCrisis, #World, #Culture, #Business, #Science, #Justice, #CarlCameron. News reporting is rarely presented as original content, with most providing a summary that leads to the full article or others that simply link straight to the offsite article.
Front Page Live frequently uses loaded emotional wording in headlines such as
[Why Trump might be panicking about suburban women](https://www.frontpageslive.com/2019/08/24/why-trump-might-be-panicking-about-suburban-women/). This story summarizes an article from the left-leaning [Think Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/think-progress/) that failed fact checks. In an original article, [Jimmy is back! Republicans have tried many times to count President Carter out, and they have never been right](https://www.frontpageslive.com/2019/08/27/republicans-count-president-jimmy-carter-out-never-been-right/); they properly source their information from the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the [Atlanta Journal Constitution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/atlanta-journal-constitution/). FPL also frequently reports on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and supports the consensus of the science: [Trump claims ignoring climate change is protecting ‘wealth’ as he skips int’l climate meeting.](https://www.frontpageslive.com/2019/08/27/trump-claims-ignoring-climate-change-is-protecting-wealth-as-he-skips-intl-climate-meeting/) This story is appropriately sourced to the [Associated Press](https://www.frontpagelive.com/2019/08/27/trump-claims-ignoring-climate-change-is-protecting-wealth-as-he-skips-intl-climate-meeting/).
Editorially, only Carl Cameron creates editorial content, which is delivered via video. Most of his content is relatively balanced regarding liberal-conservative; however, when discussing Trump, there is always a negative tone:
[Trump’s Awful August.](https://www.frontpageslive.com/carl-camerons-videos/)
In general, most news is derived or summarized from other sources. FPL uses a wide range of sources; however, some of these have failed fact checks. Story selection almost always favors the left, especially regarding climate change.
