Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features writers such as Kurt Nimmo, the former lead editor, and writer for Infowars. What sets NB apart from other sites of this type is that the stories are, for the most part, well written and contain numerous sources. The bias of the writing is also more subtle than sites such as
[Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), but just as prevalent. Both as an overtone to all the stories as well as the sometimes questionable sources and / or the conclusions drawn from the source material. Additionally, many of their sources are other NB stories or work the author and editors have done elsewhere.
For example, in the story titled “Pedophile Hastert Case: Clinton Scandals, FBI, And The COINTELPRO II Directive” the author, Sibil Edmonds, claims that the case against Hastert had more to do with blackmail for hush money and government counter-intelligence than the actual charges. Specifically COINTELPRO II, a purported FBI operation against select public and political targets. There was an FBI operation in the 1960s,
[COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO), run by J. Edgar Hoover, that did in fact illegally target public and political figures. It was exposed and closed by Hoover in 1971. I could find no reference to COINTELPRO II, however, except on other right-wing and conspiracy sites like The Cato Institute. As to the sources in the story, of the nineteen listed, seven of the links are to the author’s own work.
Additional: Many of the stories posted on NB offer only a teaser trailer or lead in paragraph(s), with the remainder available only to members. While this was a slight hindrance to evaluating NB, there were sufficient full stories and links on the truncated stories available to make a full evaluation.
Good writing, copious sources, and the lack of over the top hyperbole present on similar sites cannot, however, mask the overall intent and agenda of NB, and earns them a rating of Conspiracy. (D. Kelley 6/12/2017) Updated (5/4/2019)
