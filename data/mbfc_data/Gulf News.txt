Analysis / Bias
In 2022,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked United Arab Emirates (UAE) 138/180 in their [Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/united-arab-emirates), stating that “the authorities can censor local or foreign publications if they criticize domestic policies, the economy, the ruling families, religion or the UAE’s relations with its allies.” [Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51762543) is the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and ruler of the Emirate of Dubai. [Read our detailed profile on UAE’s government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-arab-emirates-media-profile/)
In review, Gulf News publishes articles with headlines that have strong, emotionally loaded language, such as
[“Too close for comfort: Homosexuality in schools](https://gulfnews.com/general/too-close-for-comfort-homosexuality-in-schools-1.581282).” They state the “rise in the number of same-sex relationships in UAE schools a growing concern.” A quote from the article reads, “Authorities are trying to curb deviant behavior to better reflect the traditional conservative laws of the UAE.”
Gulf News mostly focuses on positive coverage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
[“Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid praises the patriotic and humanitarian stands of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed”](https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-praises-the-patriotic-and-humanitarian-stands-of-sheikh-mohammed-bin-zayed-1.71443447) and lacking in any criticism of him [“Learn lessons of success from Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid](https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/learn-lessons-of-success-from-sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-1.69972216).”
Gulf News reports selectively when the issue doesn’t resonate with the Ruler. For example, news related to his wife, where
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) reports [“Princess Haya: Dubai ruler’s wife in UK ‘in fear of her life”](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48843168); however, Gulf News does not report this.
Gulf News often sources through quotes and utilizes Emirates News Agency (WAM) which is the official news agency of the United Arab Emirates. They also republish
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) news stories. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a negative tone [“COVID-19: Trump suggests injecting disinfectants to fight coronavirus”](https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/covid-19-trump-suggests-injecting-disinfectants-to-fight-coronavirus-1.1587705796144). In general, this is a source that promotes pro-State propaganda and is not always factual.
