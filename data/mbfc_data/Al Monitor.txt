Analysis / Bias
In review, Al-Monitor reports on news from the Middle East with a slight left-leaning perspective. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded emotional language:
[From Russia with love: Turkish and Syrian spymasters meet in Moscow](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/01/turkey-syria-russia-fidan-mamlouk-meeting-normalization.html#ixzz6BcMGsXXv). This story is appropriately sourced to [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Other stories are republished from credible sources such as the [AFP](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/afp/2020/01/iraq-politics-protests-demonstration.html#ixzz6BcNnBMJW): [Iraq protesters, police grapple for Baghdad streets as deadline expires](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/afp/2020/01/iraq-politics-protests-demonstration.html#ixzz6BcNnBMJW). When reporting on USA news, they have a slightly negative opinion of the former Trump Administration such as this: [Intel: Why the Trump administration keeps dodging Iran briefings on Capitol Hill](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/01/intel-trump-cancel-iran-briefing-congress-soleimani.html#ixzz6BcOG96YB). Al-Monitor generally reports news factually and with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
