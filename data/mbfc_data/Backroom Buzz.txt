Founded in 2019 by Dominick Mezzapesa, Backroom Buzz is a conservative news and opinion blog/website. Although they completely lack transparency through not listing an owner or an about page, their disclaimer does state “BackroomBuzz Conservative Political News does not make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.” They at least admit they may not be accurate.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Backroom Buzz does not produce original news content, but rather opines on current news from a conservative perspective. There is frequent use of loaded language that favors the right such as this:
[President Trump: Democrats’ Impeachment Inquiry a ‘Lynching’](https://backroombuzz.com/president-trump-democrats-impeachment-inquiry-a-lynching/) and this [Liberals Fume After Facebook Lists Breitbart In News Tab](https://backroombuzz.com/liberals-fume-after-facebook-lists-breitbart-in-news-tab/). When not denigrating liberals, this site celebrates President Donald Trump such as this: [Another Day, Another Democrat, Fake News Trump Controversy](https://backroombuzz.com/another-day-another-democrat-fake-news-trump-controversy/). In general, this is a pro-Trump propaganda site that does not often source to external information.
