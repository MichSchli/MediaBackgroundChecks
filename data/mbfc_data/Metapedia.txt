Analysis / Bias
In review, Metapedia is a Wiki site that describes itself as being an alternative to Wikipedia that focuses on European culture, art, science, philosophy, and politics. The site has more than 4,900 articles in English covering a variety of topics, with a majority focusing on White Nationalism and antisemitism. The website features a Did you Know section that promotes racism, such as this “
[White demographics](https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/White_demographics) show that Whites will soon become minorities worldwide?” and antisemitism, “the extent of [Jewish influence](https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Jewish_influence) has been described as remarkably large in many countries?” There is no way to sugarcoat it, this is an extreme right-biased hate website.
