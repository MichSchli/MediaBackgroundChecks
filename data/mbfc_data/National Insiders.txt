Although they provide an about page and name authors, they lack transparency as they do not name an editor or clearly state ownership. They also do not disclose their conservative bias.

Analysis / Bias
National Insiders does not publish original news reporting but rather summarizes and opines on published news stories. Articles and headlines contain loaded emotional wording that always favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this
[Pelosi Shows Her Blatant Disregard For American Lives.](https://nationalinsiders.com/pelosi-shows-her-blatant-disregard-for-american-lives/) They often use poor sources such as [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/) and credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/); however, they rarely provide hyperlinks making it difficult to find the source of information.
Editorially, all stories and opinions strongly favor the right, especially former President Trump, such as this
[Trump Makes Biden Regret Every Decision He’s Made As President](https://nationalinsiders.com/trump-makes-biden-regret-every-decision-hes-made-as-president/). After the 2020 Presidential election, they frequently promoted the stolen election narrative using unreliable sources such as [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/), who routinely fails fact checks [Tucker Destroys Democrats With Undeniable Election Fraud Truth](https://nationalinsiders.com/tucker-destroys-democrats-with-undeniable-election-fraud-truth/). As of this date, there is [no proof](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/) the election was stolen. Finally, during 2021 they frequently promoted big government conspiracy theories regarding masks and vaccines and exaggerated the dangers of vaccines [Terrifying Vaccine Side Effects Force CDC To Call Emergency Meeting](https://nationalinsiders.com/terrifying-vaccine-side-effects-force-cdc-to-call-emergency-meeting/). In general, they are far-right biased and a low credible source of information.
