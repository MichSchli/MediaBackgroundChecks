Analysis / Bias
In review, National File publishes conspiracy and pseudoscience-related news stories from an extreme right perspective. Articles frequently use loaded emotional language:
[Biden Slammed By The Left As An Attempted Social Security-Cutter](https://nationalfile.com/biden-slammed-by-the-left-as-an-attempted-social-security-cutter/). This story is sourced from the Questionable Breitbart as well as the credible [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/). The website also features a section dedicated to immigration that routinely portrays immigrants negatively, such as this: [FLASHBACK: Swedish Boy Beaten by Migrant for Having Blue Eyes](https://nationalfile.com/flashback-swedish-boy-beaten-by-migrant-for-having-blue-eyes/). In general, National File takes a strong white nationalist anti-immigration position through negative portrayal of immigrants and/or Muslims as criminals or dangerous such as this: [UK: Pedophile Rape Gang Left to Roam Streets, Police Knew, Did Nothing About it](https://nationalfile.com/uk-pedophile-rape-gang-left-to-roam-streets-police-knew-did-nothing-about-it/).
National File frequently publishes conspiracies such as the
[Clintons](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009174706/https://nationalfile.com/howley-predatory-elites-thrive-on-the-suffering-of-young-black-men/) being involved in human sex trafficking to World Trade Center conspiracies, implying that the towers were taken down by [controlled demolition](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009174701/https://nationalfile.com/study-finds-melted-steel-beams-did-not-cause-wtc-building-7-collapse/). Both claims have been [debunked](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a6384/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center/). They also reject human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and frequently resort to [pseudoscience](https://nationalfile.com/psychologists-invent-new-disorder-eco-anxiety-say-protesting-climate-change-only-cure/) or junk science to validate their points. Finally, they promote anti-vaccine propaganda: [Parents Take To The Streets To Save Vaccine Exemptions From Political Elites](https://nationalfile.com/parents-take-to-the-streets-to-save-vaccine-exemptions-from-political-elites/). In general, National File is a light version of [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) that lacks credibility.
