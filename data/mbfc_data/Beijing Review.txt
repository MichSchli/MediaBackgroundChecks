Analysis / Bias
[Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/china) report states, “President Xi Jinping has succeeded in imposing a social model in China based on control of news and information and online surveillance of its citizens. At the same time, he has been trying to export this oppressive model by promoting a “new world media order” under China’s influence” According to their 2023 report, China ranks 179 out of 180, which equates to almost zero press freedom.
In review, most articles pertaining to the Communist Government are favorable with zero criticism of President Xi Jinping. In other words, the content you find on the website is generally factual and neutral in tone. Still, the consistent bias by omission makes Beijing Review a factually Mixed propaganda source. For example,
[“Xi’s Focus: Xi Jinping on Ethnic Unity”](http://www.bjreview.com/Nation/202006/t20200611_800209586.html) and [“Xi underlines winning anti-poverty battle during Ningxia inspection.”](http://www.bjreview.com/Nation/202006/t20200611_800209521.html) Further, when sourcing, they typically utilize the factually mixed Chinese state-run press agency [Xinhua News Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/xinhua-news-agency/) and China Daily (English-language daily newspaper owned by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party) and Western news sources such as [HuffPost](http://www.bjreview.com/World/202006/t20200611_800209605.html). When reporting news pertaining to the USA, Beijing Review utilizes emotionally loaded words in their articles. They present a negative tone towards the former Trump administration [“Trump administration politicizes pandemic for electoral gain.”](http://www.bjreview.com/Opinion/202005/t20200507_800203266.html) In general, the news is reported factually; however, it is misleading due to strong censorship of anything negative toward China.
