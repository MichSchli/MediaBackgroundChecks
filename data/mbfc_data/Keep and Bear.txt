History
Keep and Bear was launched in 2016, and according to their
[about page](https://keepandbear.com/about-us/) “KeepAndBear.com is a news-driven opinion site that delivers commentary, informed by a right-leaning worldview, to like-minded Americans. Daily you’ll find views on the news from conservative/libertarian, free market, pro-faith, and pro-family perspectives. Our independent writers thoughtfully select MSM-reported news stories, craft commentary, select open source or purchased stock images, and publish to the public at no charge through this website.” The website does not list an editor.
Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, KeepandBear.com is the property of
[Romulus Marketing, LLC.](https://romulusmarketing.com/) Funding is derived from onsite advertising and an [online store](https://store.keepandbear.com/) to purchase anti-liberal, pro-conservative merchandise.
Analysis / Bias
In review, KeepandBear.com typically provides opinionated commentary about a news article through republishing or large block quotes. All stories reviewed favored the right and denigrated the left. Here is a sample right biased headline and article:
[HAWAII FALLS TO LIBERAL LEFTIST NONSENSE ON GUN CONTROL.](https://keepandbear.com/2a/hawaii-falls-to-liberal-leftist-nonsense-on-gun-control/) When quoting sources, KeepandBear.com uses mostly known sources that are right-leaning. Some of these sources have a poor track record with fact-checkers such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/), but we could not find evidence of false information on Keep and Bear. In general, as one can gather from the title of the website, this is a pro-gun and pro-second amendment website, with news related to these issues.
A
