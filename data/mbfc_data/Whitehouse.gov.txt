History
[Launched in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehouse.gov), whitehouse.gov is the official website of the White House. It contains information about the President, the Vice President, their families, press releases, proclamations, executive orders, and some speeches by White House officials. It has the official websites of several offices in the Executive Office of the President, such as the [Office of Management and Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget) and the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Science_and_Technology_Policy).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Whitehouse.gov publishes news and information about the current Presidential Administration. As of this review, Democrat Joe Biden is the President of the United States. The website typically publishes statements & releases, remarks, Presidential memorandum, fact sheets, and news clips. Headlines and articles use minimally loaded language such as this:
[Inaugural Address by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/01/20/inaugural-address-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr/). Fact Sheets often highlight the successes of the Biden administration such as this: [Fact Sheet: President Biden Signs Executive Order Enabling All Qualified Americans to Serve Their Country in Uniform](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/).
News is generally factual; however, it is one-sided, which is to be expected. Therefore, the website generally serves as a propaganda outlet for each administration. In this case, whitehouse.gov is strongly Left-Center biased due to only publishing positive news regarding the Biden administration.
