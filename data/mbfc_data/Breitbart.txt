History
Breitbart News is a conservative news and opinion website founded in 2007 by Andrew Breitbart (1969–2012). He was a conservative commentator and entrepreneur, “a former liberal from Los Angeles who became a conservative,”
[wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/business/media/what-is-breitbart-news.html) Jonah Engel Bromwich of the NY Times. Breitbart News, under his leadership, generated news coverage that was praised by the right for its populist, anti-establishment voice on the left; however, he was also accused of being a provocateur and misleading. Andrew Breitbart also [co-founded](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/us/andrew-breitbart-conservative-blogger-dies-at-43.html) the [Huffington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/).
After Andrew Breitbart died in 2012, a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs, Stephen Bannon became the Breitbart executive chairman.
[Under Bannon](https://apnews.com/f476183e30664524a534f5c0b997f98c), the website became more nationalist and a vocal outlet of the alt-right movement. According to Sarah Posner from [Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/), during her interview with Bannon, he described Breitbart News as [“a platform to the alt-right.”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-alt-right-breitbart-news/) Bannon, who was chief executive of the Trump campaign, and then-White House [chief strategist](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/09/steve-bannon-leaves-breitbart-after-expressing-regret-over-trump-remarks) for seven months before returning to Breitbart News, had stepped down from his position at Breitbart in 2018.
Larry Solov is the co-founder and CEO of Breitbart News, and Alex Marlow serves as editor-in-chief.
In October 2018, Breitbart was

Further, they were added as a reliable news source to Facebook’s new news initiative. Several media outlets met this decision with harsh criticism, including [Media Bias Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/10/25/facebooks-new-quality-news-section-to-feature-the-questionable-breitbart/).
