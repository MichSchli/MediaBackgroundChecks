Analysis / Bias
The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace & World Affairs provides original reporting and well-sourced content featuring contributions from researchers and scholars. One example is a report titled
[“China’s Religious Diplomacy for Its Belt and Road Initiative,”](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/china-s-religious-diplomacy-for-its-belt-and-road-initiative) this article investigates [China’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/) use of five major religions for its BRI diplomacy. The 14-page report cites various sources, including those with lower credibility, such as The People’s Daily, but they contribute to a thorough analysis of the subject.
The center’s publications include individual authors’ or scholars’ opinions and perspectives based on their research and expertise. For example, an article titled
[“Faith and Politics in the Biden Era: The Crisis and Opportunity of U.S. Catholicism”](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/responses/faith-and-politics-in-the-biden-era-the-crisis-and-opportunity-of-u-s-catholicism) discusses left-leaning issues such as pro-immigration, workers’ rights, and climate change while acknowledging disagreements over abortion and LGBT rights. The article cites credible sources, such as the official Supreme Court website, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, [the New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), and [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/). Another article, [“Donald Trump’s Self-Destructive Policies on Religion,”](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/donald-trump-s-self-destructive-policies-on-religion) takes a critical stance towards former President Trump’s policies.
In general, The Berkley Center is fact-based and holds left-leaning editorial positions.
