Analysis / Bias
Caravan Magazine offers detailed reporting on complex issues, often employing emotionally loaded language. For instance, in the article
[‘Manipur Displays Modi’s Idea of India,’](https://caravanmagazine.in/commentary/manipur-violence-narendra-modi-idea-of-india) the author provides a comprehensive account of the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur, India, using strong language to highlight differing views of key figures and reports on violent incidents. However, the article lacks direct hyperlinks to its sources, which may hinder information verification.
Another article, “
[Modi Government’s Attempts to Replace Rights with Duties will have damning consequences,”](https://caravanmagazine.in/commentary/narendra-modi-duties-over-rights-damning-consequences) uses emotionally loaded language to critique the government’s perceived attack on rights. The author criticizes the government’s emphasis on duties over rights, characterizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks as derisive and ominous using phrases such as “damning consequences,” “consistent attack on the idea of rights,” and “ominous phrase.” However, the article lacks direct hyperlinks to its sources, making it harder for readers to verify the information.
In general, Caravan Magazine holds a left-leaning editorial bias in opposition to right-wing Prime Minister Modi. It is fact-based but uses poor sourcing techniques rendering it mostly factual in reporting.
