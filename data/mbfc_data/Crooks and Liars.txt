Analysis / Bias
In review, Crooks and Liars typically publish information favorable to the left while denigrating the right. Headlines are usually loaded with sensational wording like this:
[Fox News Host Laura Ingraham Made A Fool Of Herself Trying To Pwn The Libs](https://crooksandliars.com/2019/09/fox-news-host-laura-ingram-made-fool). This story is sourced to video followed by opinion commentary from the author. In another loaded headline, they report negatively on President Trump with this: [GOP Cancels Four Primaries; Is Trump That Weak?](https://crooksandliars.com/2019/09/gop-cancels-four-primaries-trump-weak) This story is sourced to [MSNBC video](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and tweets.
The website also has a section called
[CLTV](https://crooksandliars.com/cltv), which publishes video clips from other sources such as [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). Regardless of the source, the video almost always portrays the right negatively. In the [MediaBites](https://crooksandliars.com/media-bites) section, they typically publish a video clip from the above-mentioned sources and provide a written transcript below.
Regarding science, Crooks and Liars support the consensus of science regarding
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and vaccines. However, when reporting on [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), most articles report [negatively](https://crooksandliars.com/solr/GMO). In general, news reporting is rooted in fact, though the use of strongly loaded language can be misleading and potentially sway the reader.
