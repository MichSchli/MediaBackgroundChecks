Analysis / Bias
The Japan News publishes articles with minimal emotionally loaded language, such as
[“Tokyo chief public prosecutor hands in resignation over gambling scandal.”](https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0006562711) However, in this article, they omit details such as the Prosecutors’ ties to the former Abe government. The same news was reported by [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) with the headline [“Japan PM Abe’s support slides as top prosecutor’s resignation bites.”](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN22Z0GO)
The Japan News typically reports with balance, representing all sides. Here is an example regarding the funding of the social security system that presents both former Prime Minister Abe’s and the opposition’s views on the matter
[“Ruling, opposition party candidates divided on how to fund social security system](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN22Z0GO).”
When it comes to sourcing, The Japan News often sources through quotes and also utilizes
[credible news sources](https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0006373639) such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and the Jiji news agency (Jiji Press Ltd. is a Japanese news agency). The Japan Times also has a partnership with two USA papers: [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Los Angeles Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), and a partnership with a UK newspaper, [The Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/) When covering world news, they republish stories from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, The Japan News generally provides balance; however, our review concludes that more favor the right-leaning government through mild criticism of the opposition:
[Opposition must avoid repeating DPJ’s errors, look for better policies](https://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0006010780).
