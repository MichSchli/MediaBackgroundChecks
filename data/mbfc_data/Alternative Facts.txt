James Schlarmann’s bio reads, “Comedian, writer, semi-amateur burrito wrangler and platypus aficionado, James cannot and will not be pigeonholed by anyone’s expectations. Unless you want to pay him money, in which case his principles are as malleable as his “children” are “in need of food.” Winner of absolutely zero lifetime achievement awards. You should definitely not give a shit about his opinions.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website proclaims to be satire at the bottom of every page, with this statement “ALL MATERIAL IS SATIRICAL IN NATURE, BILLY.” Further, their tagline reads “Your Own Reality,” and James Schlarmann openly disclaims he is a comedian that produces satire. Most stories would appeal to a liberal audience as Donald Trump and conservatives are frequent targets to be mocked. For example, these:
