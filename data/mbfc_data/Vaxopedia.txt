Analysis / Bias
In review, Dr. Iannelli’s main purpose is to
[debunk anti-vax myths](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and provide parents and people, in general, with sound scientific knowledge about vaccines. The website features the [Vaxopedia – A to Z Index](https://vaxopedia.org/2016/08/31/vaxopedia/), which lists, in order, facts, myths, and scientific answers such as this: [Aborted baby parts in vaccines?](https://vaxopedia.org/2018/04/08/which-vaccines-contain-aborted-baby-parts/) This report indicates that baby parts are not in vaccines and uses proper sources such as the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) for evidence. The website also features a blog that publishes articles such as [Remembering the Measles Epidemics of the 1990s,](https://vaxopedia.org/2019/04/27/remembering-the-measles-epidemics-of-the-1990s/) which shows the correlation between a lack of vaccinations and measles outbreaks.
