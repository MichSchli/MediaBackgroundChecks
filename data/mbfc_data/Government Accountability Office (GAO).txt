History
The
[GAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office) was established as the General Accounting Office by the [Budget and Accounting Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_and_Accounting_Act) of 1921. The act required the head of the GAO to “investigate, at the seat of government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President and to Congress reports and recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures.”
According to the GAO’s current mission statement, the agency exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the federal government’s accountability for the benefit of the American people. The General Accountability Office is overseen by
[Eugene Louis Dodaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Louis_Dodaro), [Comptroller General of the United States.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller_General_of_the_United_States) [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Government Accountability Office
[provides](https://www.gao.gov/about/workforce/ocg.html) auditing, evaluation, and investigative services for the United States Congress. It is the primary audit institution of the federal government of the USA and is known as the “ [Congressional Watchdog.](https://www.gao.gov/about/index.html)” Put simply, GAO tries to prevent wasteful spending of tax dollars.
In review, GAO does not use loaded language and always presents
[researched information](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-669). Sourced information comes from the [Congressional Budget Office](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/congressional-budget-office-cbo/) and other government accounting agencies. This is a low-biased information source that is used by Congress when passing bills and budgets.
