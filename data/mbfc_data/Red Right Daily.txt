History
Red Right Daily publishes conservative news and opinion article summaries. According to their
[about page,](https://redrightdaily.com/about/) “Red Right Daily came about as an outlet for the frustration those of us involved had with the political and media fields. While we are Conservative we aim to always ensure that the information we base our articles about is as factual as possible.” The website lacks transparency as it does not name authors, editors, or owners.

Analysis / Bias
Red Right Daily does not perform original news reporting. A typical story takes a quote from another story and then summarizes and adds opinions around the quotes. Most headlines are highly emotional such as this
[NYT Eats Crow – Conspiracy Theory True After All!](https://redrightdaily.com/nyt-eats-crow-conspiracy-theory-true-after-all/)
Editorially most stories favor the right through story selection and often promote former President Trump, such as this
[Does Kellyanne Conway Have Inside Information About Trump and 2024?](https://redrightdaily.com/does-kellyanne-conway-have-inside-information-about-trump-and-2024/) They also report misinformation and conspiracy theories about an “open border,” such as this [Last 48 Hours Decimate Biden, Neurotic Paranoia & Denials Unmask The Administration](https://web.archive.org/web/20220712164544/https://redrightdaily.com/last-48-hours-decimate-biden-neurotic-paranoia-denials-unmask-the-administration-video/). This article also contains misinformation regarding Covid-19, where they state, “Kids have statistically ~no risk of dying of COVID.” To date, there have been [over 1000 deaths](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3) in children.
Red Right Daily is right-biased based on story selection and usually does not provide hyperlinked sourcing. Unfortunately, the complete lack of transparency lowers their credibility and renders them Mixed for factual reporting and questionable.
