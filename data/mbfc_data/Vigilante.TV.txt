Analysis / Bias
Vigilante.TV, also known as “The Dollar Vigilante,” is a platform focusing on financial and economic topics and conspiracy theories. It has a libertarian and anarcho-capitalist orientation. The content challenges mainstream scientific and political narratives on various issues, from COVID-19 and vaccines to climate change and freedom of expression in schools.
In the video titled
[“New Scariant For The Proletariat: Make America Scared Again,”](https://vigilante.tv/w/grw8ArwrskP576Yu6eo9rj) which is 1 hour and 37 minutes long, Jeff Berwick covers a multitude of controversial topics. Among these, he claims that the COVID-19 vaccine causes deaths, a statement that contradicts established scientific consensus and lacks substantial empirical evidence. This claim is part of a broader narrative in which Berwick denies the reality of COVID-19, questions the safety of vaccines, and suggests hidden political agendas behind the pandemic.
Further, he also touches on climate change, hinting at a conspiracy to “burn the world” to validate man-made global warming theories. The video from Vigilante.TV references content from
[Press for Truth](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/press-for-truth/), which is known for promoting misinformation
Additionally, Berwick criticizes what he perceives as a double standard in schools regarding accepting Pride and Black Lives Matter flags but not the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag.
Finally, Berwick’s commentary aligns with conspiracy theories and pseudoscience, challenging mainstream scientific and political narratives without offering credible evidence. His content is similar in tone to other videos he has produced, such as “How to Survive the Orwellian Apocalypse: You Can Run, Hide, Fight or Change,” “Poisons, Potions, And Programming … All Part Of Global Control Experimentation,” and “The Zelensky Show – $500 Billion To The Naked Whorelord In Heels.” Given these elements, the video raises significant questions about its credibility and impact.
