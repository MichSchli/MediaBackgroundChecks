Funded by / Ownership
Like most questionable sources there is not a disclosure of ownership or authorship. Political State appears to be funded strictly through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Political State is a strongly left-leaning source that frequently uses loaded emotional language such as this:
[Mitch McConnell Kisses Trump’s Ass Again, Applauds POTUS’ Mexico Debacle](https://politicalstate.org/mitch-mcconnell-kisses-trumps-ass-again-applauds-potus-mexico-debacle/). This story is not sourced at all. In another randomly [chosen story](https://politicalstate.org/top-gop-senator-praises-trumps-plan-even-though-its-going-to-cost-his-own-state-close-to-2-billion-dollars/), there is proper sourcing. All stories reviewed favor the left and denigrate the right. For the most part, stories are sourced properly, but some are to [Shareblue,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shareblue/) which is owned by operatives who have influence over the Democratic party.
