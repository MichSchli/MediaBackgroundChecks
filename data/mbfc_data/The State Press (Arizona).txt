Analysis / Bias
In review, local and college information is covered with minimal bias, such as this:
[Sun Devil swimming and diving open season with intrasquad scrimmage](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/09/spsport-sun-devil-swimdive-opens-season-intrasquad-scrimmage). A review of news stories reveals consistent sourcing of information from credible sources. When covering politics, there is a neutral tone with balanced coverage, such as this story: [Arizona students take part in global climate strike](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/09/sppolitics-students-in-phoenix-take-part-in-a-global-climate-strike). This story is also very well sourced to Congress.gov.
Editorially, The State Press tends to represent both sides politically; however, in total more stories favor the left, such as this:
[Opinion: We need to view birth control differently.](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/06/spopinion-birthcontrol-rhetoric) In general, news reporting is well-sourced and low-biased, while the opinion page tends to favor the left by a large margin, such as this [Opinion: DACA voices need representation and protection](https://www.statepress.com/article/2019/04/spopinion-daca-voices-need-to-be-more-represented).
On 9/28/2019, the State Press broke a news story that has been picked up by credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/09/28/when-trumps-special-envoy-ukraine-resigned-student-newspaper-beat-everyone-story/). This story involves Kurt Volker, U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, who resigned on this date and was executive director of Arizona State’s McCain Institute.
“The student paper first
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/statepress/status/1177707100132110336) the news at 6:10 p.m. Friday, setting off a race among national political reporters to confirm it and racking up thousands of retweets along the way. At 6:18 p.m., the article hit the paper’s website, published alongside dispatches on the university’s clubs and teams. For a little while, the State Press was the only publication that had the story. The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), New York Times, and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) followed with their own reports about an hour later.”
