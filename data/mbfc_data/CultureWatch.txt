Analysis / Bias
CultureWatch is a website that covers a broad range of topics related to Christianity and culture. One example of an article on CultureWatch is
[“The Dangers of Compromise,”](https://billmuehlenberg.com/2023/04/27/the-dangers-of-compromise/) the author cites various Bible passages throughout the article to support his argument. However, the website, in general, publishes articles with strong, emotionally loaded language, such as [“Our Beloved Leader: Embracing Chistophobia and Islamophilia,”](https://billmuehlenberg.com/2022/12/07/our-beloved-leader-embracing-chistophobia-and-islamophilia/) and uses derogatory language, such as “Danistan,” to refer to the state of Victoria and calls the premier “Dictator Dan” in a derogatory manner. The author also accuses the premier of promoting homosexuality and being “anti-Christian” without providing any evidence to support these claims.
Furthermore, the author claims that Christians in Victoria are being “hunted down and persecuted” for affirming their beliefs, yet provides no evidence to support this claim. Overall, the article contains significant bias in wording and portrays a strong anti-Islamic sentiment while portraying Christianity in a positive light. It uses derogatory language to attack the premier and makes unsupported claims about the persecution of Christians in Victoria.
Another article on the website,
[“Tucker and the War on Conservatives,”](https://billmuehlenberg.com/2023/04/25/tucker-and-the-war-on-conservatives/) suggests that [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) is a victim of a wider attack on conservatives. Muehlenberg appears to have a bias in favor of Tucker Carlson and conservative views while being critical of those who oppose them. Most articles on the website are not sourced; if they are sourced, Muehlenberg cites sources such as [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [The Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), and [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/).
Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic Muehlenberg endorsed pseudoscientific claims from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who
[frequently promotes disinformation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/) on the dangers of vaccines: [A REVIEW OF A LETTER TO LIBERALS. BY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR.](https://billmuehlenberg.com/2022/10/09/a-review-of-a-letter-to-liberals-by-robert-f-kennedy-jr/) In this letter, Kennedy relies on [unsubstantiated VAERS data](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/what-vaers-is-and-isnt) claiming thousands have died from the vaccine. He also promotes unproven treatments for covid, like “ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine,” which have limited evidence to support their effectiveness and may be harmful if taken in the wrong dosage. In general, this is a right-leaning conspiracy and pseudoscience website.
