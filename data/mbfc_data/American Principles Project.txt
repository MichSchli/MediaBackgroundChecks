Analysis / Bias
While opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage, APP largely focuses on promoting immigration reform, opposing the
[critical race theory](https://americanprinciplesproject.org/legislation/app-endorses-senate-bill-targeting-critical-race-theory-schools-government/), and defending religious liberty (against LGBTQ and abortion). They have also advocated for monetary reform by suggesting a return to the gold standard.
In reviewing the website, the primary mission, according to their articles, is to suppress women’s rights through banning abortion and limiting the freedom and liberty of LGBTQ. They also use misleading information, such as the
[debunked video](http://www.snopes.com/pp-baby-parts-sale/) of Planned Parenthood selling baby parts. The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) has accused American Principles Project of [promoting conspiracies](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/margins-mainstream) but has not formally labeled them a hate group.
Editorially the APP strongly favors former President Trump, such as this
[APP Blasts Facebook Oversight Board Ahead of Trump Decision](https://americanprinciplesproject.org/media/app-blasts-facebook-oversight-board-ahead-trump-decision/). Further, they have promoted debunked election fraud conspiracies endorsed by Trump, such as this [AFTER Win Again Save America](https://americanprinciplesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/APP-2021-MAGA-Report_web.pdf). In general, they strongly favor the right and former President Trump while often promoting conspiracies that denigrate LGBTQ and women’s rights.
