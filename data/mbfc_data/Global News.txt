Analysis / Bias
In review, Global News presents fair, balanced, well-sourced, and factual news in its reporting. Local news is written through staff writers and contains minimally loaded language such as this:
[Penticton shootings: John Brittain charged with murder following B.C. shooting spree](https://globalnews.ca/news/5173088/penticton-shootings-suspect-john-brittain/). World News is also written by Global News writers and from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Those articles that are not direct carryovers contain a [slight Left Bias](https://globalnews.ca/news/5167631/commentary-conservatives-alternatives-carbon-tax/), although the reporting is, again, well-sourced and factual.
This review is only based on GN’s political reporting. While this reviewer is no expert on Canadian politics, the articles I read on those subjects appeared to have a slight Left Bias. Finally, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 71% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/canada) and 12% do not, ranking them #1 in trust among the major English language Canadian news providers.
