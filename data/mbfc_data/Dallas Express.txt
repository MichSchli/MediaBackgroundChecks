History
The
[Dallas Express](https://dallasexpress.com/) was founded in 2021, reviving a title that served the Dallas Black community until the mid-1970s. Located in Dallas, Texas, the website covers local and national news and events.
The
[About page](https://dallasexpress.com/about/) states that the current publisher has significant ties to the hospitality industry and chairs three public companies but does not explicitly name Monty Bennett. According to a [Texas Observer article](https://www.texasobserver.org/the-dallas-express-your-go-to-source-for-right-wing-astroturf-news/), Bennett is a Trump-supporting billionaire.
Further, a
[Bloomberg Law article](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/dallas-weekly-defeats-libel-claims-brought-by-conservative-donor) reports that Bennett sued a journalist and Dallas Weekly, Inc. for libel after they described the Dallas Express as a “right-wing propaganda site,” a case that a Texas appeals court later dismissed.

[According](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/community-newsmaker-metric-media-local-news.php) to [Columbia Journalism Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-journalism-review/), Bennett may have a connection with the conservative imposter website network [Metric Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/metric-media/). Bennett denies the connection.
Analysis / Bias
After reviewing dozens of articles, we selected two example articles from the Dallas Express to assess their journalistic approach and potential biases.
The first article,
[“Biden Name Attracted China, Report Suggests,”](https://dallasexpress.com/national/biden-name-attracted-china-report-suggests/) discusses a report suggesting the Biden family name attracted interest from CEFC China Energy for acquiring U.S. energy assets. The article adopts a skeptical tone, especially with the word “suggests” in the title. Notably, the article does not provide conclusive evidence to substantiate the claims made in the so-called report about the Biden family name attracting interest from CEFC China Energy. It cites a Radar Online [article](https://radaronline.com/p/biden-leaked-text-messages-fbi-chinese-acquire-us-energy-assets/), which employs a misleading tactic where keywords like [“FBI”](https://radaronline.com/t/fbi/) and [“Joe Biden”](https://radaronline.com/t/joe-biden/) are hyperlinked to their own tag pages. These tag pages are collections of articles related to those keywords but do not provide additional information or sources that substantiate the article’s claims, which raises significant concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the information presented. Therefore, the article does not prove the veracity of the report it discusses.
The second article,
[“Trump steps into Democrat territory in Labor Day message to unionized auto workers, telling them Biden’s E.V. push will cost them their jobs,”](https://dallasexpress.com/national/trump-tells-uaw-dump-biden-save-jobs/) maintains a skeptical tone and frames Biden’s electric vehicle policy as controversial and economically damaging. The article ends by emphasizing that the attorneys general of 25 states oppose Biden’s plan, framing the policy as contentious. Regarding sources, the article cites an [Associated Press article](https://apnews.com/article/biden-labor-day-2024-election-011b5c6b283b60d3b69398f1e081a0d4) but frames the information differently. The Dallas Express suggests that Biden’s handling of the economy is seen as a “weakness,” a point not explicitly made in the [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) article, thereby leading the narrative.
In general, The Dallas Express demonstrates questionable journalistic practices. They often cite unreliable sources, as seen in the article
[“Biden Name Attracted China, Report Suggests”](https://dallasexpress.com/national/biden-name-attracted-china-report-suggests/) and utilize [factually questionable sources](https://dallasexpress.com/national/jan-6-capitol-police-allegedly-repeatedly-strike-unconscious-protester/) like the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/); when referencing credible sources like the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/biden-labor-day-2024-election-011b5c6b283b60d3b69398f1e081a0d4), they distort the information to fit a specific narrative.
