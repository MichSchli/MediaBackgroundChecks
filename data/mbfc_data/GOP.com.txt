History
[A search](http://whois.domaintools.com/gop.gov) of GOP.gov indicates this web address was registered privately in 2000. There isn’t any information that describes the website, and news is presented by the Press Team without disclosing authors. Further, when you click on the privacy policy, you are linked to the real [www.house.gov/privacy-policy](https://www.house.gov/privacy-policy). This website completely lacks transparency.
Through backtracking the domain, we found that it once belonged to the GOP Pledge to America website under the domain pledge.gop.gov.
[The Pledge to America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_to_America) is a list of proposed legislative items that the Republican Party promised to pursue in the 112th Congress if Republicans gained a majority of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2010 election. The Pledge to America was written by Rep. [Kevin McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(California_politician))‘s staffer Brian Wild at the behest of House Republican leaders.
As of this date,
[not a single item](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/22/john-boehner-house-republicans-break-pledge-to-ame/) on the pledge was ever accomplished, and as of 2014, all information regarding the pledge had been removed from the website.

The GOP.gov website does not disclose ownership or funding, again completely lacking transparency.
Analysis / Bias
In review, GOP.gov provides a list of all Republican Representatives and information regarding their annual conference. The website also provides news stories that always favor the right with loaded emotional headlines such as this:
[Desperate Pelosi Claims She Has An Agenda](https://www.gop.gov/desperate-pelosi-claims-she-has-an-agenda/). This article does not offer an author and is not well written. In another article [POLL: Dems’ Far Left Policies Out of Touch With Rest of the Country,](https://www.gop.gov/poll-dems-far-left-policies-out-of-touch-with-rest-of-the-country/) there is proper sourcing, but it is hard to believe that a so-called official Government site would write such a short and minimal detailed message. A general search of GOP.gov also does not cover any stories with search authority.
In general, this is an informational website for the GOP that provides right-biased news and completely lacks transparency.
Failed Fact Checks
- There is no record of this site being fact-checked; however, the politicians they cover frequently make false claims.
