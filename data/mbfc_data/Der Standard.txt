Analysis / Bias
Der Standard publishes interviews with politicians such as this interview titled
[“Vilimsky: “In any case, I respect the opinion of Hungarians and Poles”](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000127935220/vilimsky-ich-respektiere-jedenfalls-die-meinung-der-ungarn-und-polen) with a leading FPÖ politician from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and also a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from [Austria](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/austria-media-profile/), Harald Vilimsky. Questions range from LGBTQI law in Hungary to the parties’ alleged relationship with Russia.
Der Standard’s coverage of national politics, particularly regarding Sebastian Kurz, who is the current Chancellor and the leader of the Populist right-wing The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), is critical in tone and wording. For example, in this article, the columnist likens him to the far-right Prime Minister of Hungary Victor Orban through calling him Orban Light,
[“In short and the politics of the “Orbán light.”](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000124513136/kurz-und-die-politik-des-orban-light) Another example of negative reporting is this [“The Chancellor has perfected the role of victim and is apparently striving for a special legal status.”](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000126707183/sonderstatus-kurz)
On issues such as immigration, their coverage is positive and balanced
[“How the pandemic affects migration.”](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000121860882/wie-die-pandemie-migration-beeinflusst) They also promote [environmentalism.](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000117474105/und-auf-die-klimakrise-wird-vergessen) Their coverage of the opposition SPÖ party leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner (Center-Left) is republished by The Austria Press Agency (APA), such as [“Rendi-Wagner wants to continue despite her meager re-election result,”](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000127762217/rendi-wagner-will-trotz-magerem-ergebnis-weitermachen) which is slightly negative. Lastly, Der Standard covers the Biden Administration positively as in this article [, “Is Joe Biden at the height of his power?”](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000127905795/ist-joe-biden-schon-am-hoehepunkt-seiner-macht) Der Standard typically sources to themselves and uses quotes; however, they also utilize credible sources such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [ BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and The Austria Press Agency (APA). In general, Der Standard reports news factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
