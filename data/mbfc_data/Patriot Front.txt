History
Vanguard America, then bloodandsoil.org, and now Patriot Front is a Neo-Nazi white supremacist hate group. Snippets from their manifesto: “Our mission is a hard reset on the nation we see today— a return to the traditions and virtues of our forefathers. The same spirit that urged our ancestors onward to create this nation will once again be brought to light, and a new America will be built within its current dilapidated, shameful iteration.”
This manifesto is watered down compared to their previous one, which openly discloses white supremacism and antisemitism. They must be tired of having to change their domain and hosting frequently.
On June 12th, 2022, 31 members of the

In general,
[Patriot Front](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/patriot-front) is a [hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/patriot-front), according to the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) and [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/). They advocate for extreme right policies favored by the Alt-Right and white supremacists. This is a site and organization with less than zero credibility.
