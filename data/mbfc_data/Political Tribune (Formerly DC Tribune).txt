Analysis / Bias
In review, the Political Tribune exhibits overt left-wing bias through the extensive use of strong emotional wording. For example,
[Trump Sends The Most Ridiculous Message To His Supporters After Bomb Attack, Proves He’s Insane](http://dctribune.org/trump-sends-the-most-ridiculous-message-to-his-supporters-after-bomb-attack-proves-hes-insane/) and [Trump Responds To Deadly Mass Shooting At Synagogue In Most Disgusting Way, Americans Horrified](http://dctribune.org/trump-responds-to-deadly-mass-shooting-at-synagogue-in-most-disgusting-way-americans-horrified/). Although both stories are adequately sourced to credible information, a significant spin is employed through loaded language that denigrates the right.
In general, all stories on Political Tribune favor the left and denigrate the right, particularly former President Trump.
