History
Founded in 2003 by self-proclaimed GMO expert Jeffrey M. Smith, the Institute for Responsible Technology is a website that reports on GMOs.
[Jeffrey Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_M._Smith) is an American consumer activist, self-published author, and former politician. He is the author of two books on genetically engineered foods, Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies about the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You’re Eating, and Genetic Roulette: The Gamble of Our Lives, which he made into a film in 2012. According to their [about page](https://www.responsibletechnology.org/about/), “The Institute for Responsible Technology is a world leader in educating policymakers and the public about genetically modified (GM) foods and crops. We investigate and report their risks and impact on health, environment, the economy, and agriculture, as well as the problems associated with current research, regulation, corporate practices, and reporting.”
They state their mission as “To protect the genetic integrity and nature’s biological evolution by preventing the outdoor release of genetically modified organisms and to protect human and animal health by preventing the use of GMOs in the food and feed supply. In addition, we seek to stop the use of toxic agricultural chemicals associated with GMOs, such as Roundup.”

[GMOs are dangerous](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). For example, they make their case on this page [GMOs and Roundup are Dangerous!](https://www.responsibletechnology.org/gmo-dangers/) They also promote corporate conspiracy theories such as [this](https://www.responsibletechnology.org/the-cover-up/).
Rather than waste time dissecting the claims made on this website, we will simply direct you to pro-science sources of information on the safety of GMOs.
