Analysis / Bias
The website is best known for hosting a
[political quiz](https://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/) that uses the [Nolan Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart), a political spectrum diagram created by American libertarian activist David Nolan in 1969. The chart plots political views along two axes, representing economic freedom and personal freedom. It expands political view analysis beyond the traditional one-dimensional left-right/progressive-conservative divide in order to position libertarianism as outside the traditional spectrum.
[In August 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart), the libertarian [Reason](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/) magazine worked with the Rupe organization to survey 1,200 Americans by telephone and place their views within the Nolan chart categories. The Reason-Rupe poll found that “Americans cannot easily be bundled into either the ‘liberal’ or ‘conservative’ groups.” Specifically, 28% expressed conservative views, 24% expressed libertarian views, 20% expressed communitarian views, and 28% expressed liberal views. The margin of error was ±3.
The World’s Smallest Political Quiz has been
[criticized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865717/) as being “biased by using leading questions, favoring libertarian results, and imposing the libertarian definition of freedom.”
The website also provides educational materials related to libertarianism and original news reporting. News stories use moderately loaded language that favors small government libertarian perspectives such as this:
[Democratic Presidential Candidates Get $15 Minimum Wage Wrong](https://www.theadvocates.org/2019/12/democratic-presidential-candidates-get-15-minimum-wage-wrong/). The website frequently reports negatively on socialism such as this: [Swedish Ex-Prime Minister Rebukes Bernie: Socialism Only Destroys](https://www.theadvocates.org/2019/02/swedish-ex-prime-minister-rebukes-bernie-socialism-only-destroys/). This article uses a variety of factually mixed right biased sources such as [Mises](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/). Although they report negatively on progressive economics, they do not have favorable opinions regarding the former Trump Administrations’ policies such as this: [Promises Swept: Trump Escalates War in Syria For Nonsense Oil Strategy](https://www.theadvocates.org/2019/10/promises-swept-trump-escalates-war-in-syria-for-nonsense-oil-strategy/). Finally, when it comes to science, they present a skeptical view on [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), which is opposed to the consensus of science. In general, most stories are fact-based and support right-leaning free-market capitalism.
