Analysis / Bias
In review, Right Wing Tribune is an extreme right biased website with every article favoring the right and denigrating the left. There is heavy use of strong emotional language in most headlines such as this:
[BREAKING: DOJ Takes Down LEADER Of Major VIOLENT BLACK GANG … LOOK WHO IT IS!!!](https://rightwingtribune.com/2018/06/12/black-gang/). Another headline reads [BREAKING News From US Intelligence… THIS IS TERRIFYING!!! HOLY HELL!](https://rightwingtribune.com/2018/06/13/us-intelligence/) In this article, they source [SHTF Plan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shtfplan-com/), which is listed on our [questionable list](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) for promoting conspiracy theories and right-wing propaganda. Although most articles are appropriately sourced there are several that use the far-right and factually mixed [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) as well as the questionable [American Freedom Fighters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-freedom-fighters/), which has a poor track record with fact-checkers. In another story, the Right Wing Tribune promotes the conspiracy that the Clinton’s have people murdered using this headline: [BREAKING: BOMBSHELL PROOF THE CLINTONS HAD 5 PEOPLE MURDERED IN PAST 6 WEEKS](https://rightwingtribune.com/2016/08/12/dnc-staffer/). It also appears that every story on this website is a BREAKING story.
