Analysis / Bias
Grit Daily News covers various topics, including a dedicated Women Entrepreneurs section, focusing on brands, technology, fashion, entertainment, entrepreneurship, and lifestyle. The outlet’s reporting style varies. The article
[“ActionCOACH Helps Business Owners Overcome 4 Common Obstacles](https://gritdaily.com/actioncoach-helps-business-owners-overcome-obstacles/)” profiles ActionCOACH, a U.K.-based business coaching firm. Although not labeled promotional, it primarily emphasizes the firm’s services and lacks critical balance.
In contrast, “
[LAX’s Sustain with Love Initiative Supports the Elimination of Single-Use Plastic Water Bottles](https://gritdaily.com/laxs-sustain-with-love-initiative/)” discusses LAX’s initiative to reduce single-use plastic water bottles. It cites [lawa.org](https://www.lawa.org/), features quotes from key personnel involved in the initiative, and mentions the policy changes at LAX. Direct quotes and policy references add credibility and factuality to the article. The language is mainly neutral and informative, focusing on the initiative’s details. Terms like “sustainable future” and “eco-friendly movement” are used in a context that aligns with the initiative’s environmental goals. As with the first article, Jordan French is the author. However, this article maintains a largely neutral and factual tone.
The interview with artist Tulu Bayar,
[“Shifting from Traditional to Digital Photography,”](https://gritdaily.com/artist-tulu-bayar-traditional-to-digital-photography/) adds a cultural dimension to Grit Daily’s content. Bayar discusses her artistic journey, the impact of digital technology on her work, and her conceptual approaches. Her creative projects address religion, gender, and environmental issues, offering insights into contemporary societal concerns. Her observations on changing student interests at Bucknell University, where she teaches, reflect these concerns.
Lastly, the article
[“Unraveling Deceit in Trump’s Property Scandal”](https://gritdaily.com/unraveling-deceit-in-trumps-property-scandal/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) by Tim Worstell on Grit Daily News discusses how David McArdle’s testimony contradicts Eric Trump’s claims regarding his involvement in assessing a luxury golf property that potentially impacts Eric Trump’s credibility, along with concerns about a significant loan granted to Trump by Ladder Capital Corp based on an alleged inflated net worth.
Grit Daily News displays a mix of styles in its articles. The editorial tone and sourcing vary across articles, with some leaning towards a promotional tone and others being more informative and factual. Politically, more stories slightly align with a liberal perspective, such as this:
