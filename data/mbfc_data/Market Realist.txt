Analysis / Bias
Market Realist publishes articles that advise people on resisting the impulse to buy unnecessary items. It outlines strategies to help individuals become more mindful of their spending habits and make more conscious decisions about their purchases, such as
[“Are You an Impulse Buyer? Here’s How to Stop.”](https://marketrealist.com/personal-finance/how-to-stop-impulse-buying/)
Regarding news reporting, Market Realist provides well-sourced information to support claims made in the articles. However, this article’s title has strong, emotionally loaded language
[“Which Advertisers Are Left on Tucker Carlson’s Show? List Is Slim.”](https://marketrealist.com/p/who-advertises-on-tucker-carlson/) A quote from the article reads, “Carlson appeared on a [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) show in early April 2021 to speak about his belief that Democrats are intentionally bringing in immigrants to replace Americans and weaken their voting power. The [Anti-Defamation League (ADL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) pointed out that this notion is akin to the “white replacement” theory employed by white supremacists and hate groups.”
Another article titled
[“Amazon Is Closing More Stores — These Locations Will Be Impacted”](https://marketrealist.com/p/is-amazon-closing-stores/) examines Amazon’s strategy, the impact of the closures on Amazon’s business, and the potential implications for other retail stores. It is written objectively and provides a balanced analysis of Amazon’s decision to close some of its physical retail stores.
Regarding sourcing, Market Realist utilizes credible sources such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [The New York Times, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) [Fox Business](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-business/), [Seattle Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/seattle-times/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [Geekwire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geekwire-bias/).
Editorially, we found several instances where they report negatively on Fox News while having more favorable reports on the left, such as this
[Impressed by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes? Wait Until You Meet His Brother Luke](https://marketrealist.com/p/chris-hayes-brother/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
