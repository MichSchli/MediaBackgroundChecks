Analysis / Bias
The Grayzone produces in-depth journalism from a far-left perspective such as this
[The US is turning oil-rich Nigeria into a proxy for its Africa wars](https://thegrayzone.com/2021/09/13/us-oil-rich-nigeria-proxy-africa/). All stories reviewed were properly sourced from mostly credible media and information sources.
Max Blumenthal edits The Grayzone, and therefore, the website reflects his political views. He is a strong supporter of Venezuela and firmly against the USA policies of sanctions and regime change
[UN expert details crushing human toll of US sanctions on Venezuela](https://thegrayzone.com/2021/02/16/un-expert-details-crushing-human-toll-of-us-sanctions-on-venezuela/). Blumenthal and The Grayzone are vehemently opposed to Israeli occupation and treatment of Palestinians [Trump’s fake ‘peace plan’ is permanent apartheid for Palestine](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/01/29/trumps-fake-peace-plan-is-permanent-apartheid-for-palestine/). Another common theme is anti-corporate bias, such as [How big corporations and Bill Gates took over the UN food Summit](https://thegrayzone.com/2021/09/23/corporations-bill-gates-un-food-summit/).
The Grayzone publishes questionable material, stating that a Chemical Attack did not occur in Douma, Syria
[OPCW investigator testifies at UN that no chemical attack took place in Douma, Syria](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/01/22/ian-henderson-opcw-whistleblower-un-no-chemical-attack-douma-syria/). They have also promoted conspiracy theories, such as claiming that Pete Buttigieg is a CIA agent. There is [no evidence](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/12/pete-buttigieg-cia-asset-coup-latin-america/) to support this claim. Finally, according to [Radio Free Asia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-asia/), The Grayzone content is frequently shared by the Chinese Communist Party media outlets “CCP propaganda is also increasingly laundered through Western influencers and denialist fringe media outlets like The Grayzone,” the report said, adding that, between December 2019 and February 2021, The Grayzone was cited at least 313 times in Chinese state media.”
Finally, The Grayzone promotes conspiracy theories involving
[George Soros funding regime changes](https://thegrayzone.com/tag/george-soros/), and the editor Max Blumenthal claims that Bill Gates ran a [Covid simulation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531083927if_/https://twitter.com/themattdimitri/status/1267011351211171840) before it occurred. [This is false.](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/new-coronavirus-wasnt-predicted-in-simulation/) In general, The Grayzone promotes a socialist left perspective that promotes conspiracy theories and pro-Russian/Chinese propaganda.
