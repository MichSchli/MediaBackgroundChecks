Analysis / Bias
In review, the AskingAngels website consists of a section about crystals and stones and their
[healing properties](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/). Some of the topics covered are Healing, Spirituality, and a Starseed section described as “a soul from another world that incarnates on Earth to bring light and knowledge, helping Mother Earth and uplifting the people on the planet.” There are many more sections you can see in detail [here](http://askingangels.com/articles.php#Angel%20Section).
AskingAngels promotes both conspiracies and pseudoscience. They also published outright false information such as this article
[“The (old) President Has Not Abandoned You!” ](http://askingangels.com/spirit/america/the-old-president.php)with a quote from the article stating: “The television is gaslighting you. It is 100% lies. Biden has been blocked out of the Whitehouse, and they appear to be using TV sets pretending he is in the Whitehouse. What you are watching on television is one giant lie at this point. It is not clear yet if you still have a President Trump or the emergency power as gone to the military, or elsewhere, but I am sure it is not to Biden.” In other words, they are saying Biden is not the actual President. In general, this is a tin-foil hat-level conspiracy website that routinely promotes pseudoscience from a conservative (right-biased) perspective.
