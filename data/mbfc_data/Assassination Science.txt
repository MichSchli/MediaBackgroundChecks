Analysis / Bias
Assassination Science primarily covers the JFK assassination from a cover-up/conspiracy perspective. They also report on
[9/11](http://assassinationscience.com/911_Manufactured_Terrorism.pdf) as an inside job and controlled demolition. Further, they published papers [opposed to war and Neocons](http://assassinationscience.com/LiesOfTheNeocons.pdf). In general, they promote debunked or unproven conspiracy theories. This review is kept short as they have not updated the website in many years.
