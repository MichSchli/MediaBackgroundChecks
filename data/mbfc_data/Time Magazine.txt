Analysis / Bias
In review, Time a is a journalism magazine that covers current events and politics. Time utilizes loaded language in headlines such as this:
[President Trump Is Making Baseless Claims About the Migrant Caravan. Here Are the Facts](http://time.com/5430940/donald-trump-migrant-caravan-false-claims/). The information contained in articles is generally well-sourced and linked to credible factual sources. Story selection mostly favors the left with articles such as this: [Obama Rails Against Republicans in Fiery Nevada Rally](http://time.com/5431524/obama-republicans-nevada-rally/).
While Time Magazine is clearly biased in favor of left-leaning causes, they display a strong anti-Trump bias with
[daily articles](http://time.com/search/?q=trump) denigrating his policies and actions. It is important to note that holding an anti-Trump bias is not necessarily a pro-left bias, as many centrist and right-center sources also report against President Trumpâ€™s character and policies.
