Analysis / Bias
PolyGraph.info is a fact-checker funded by the USA government. While this fact checker is not left or right-biased, it is certainly pro-America, with most fact checks against
[Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-matters-bias/) and other authoritarian governments. For example, this, [China’s Murky Claims About the India Border Clash](https://www.polygraph.info/a/china-india-galwan-clash/30990671.html) and this [Kremlin Falsely Says Moscow Not at Fault for Sour Relations with US.](https://www.polygraph.info/a/kremlin-falsely-says-moscow-not-at-fault-for-sour-relations-with-us/30992615.html) The primary purpose of this website is to minimize Russian influence on the USA. Through our thorough review, we could not find any false information on this site. We should disclaim that everyone on our team is American or is a resident who has lived here for more than five years. In general, Polygraph.info is a credible fact-checker but with a pro-American bias.
