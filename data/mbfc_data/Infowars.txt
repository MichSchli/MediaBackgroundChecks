History
[Founded in 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfoWars) by [Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones), InfoWars is a far-right American conspiracy theorist and fake news website and media platform. The radio program [originates](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-visit-to-the-infowars-studios-of-alex-jones-a-1136654.html) from Austin, Texas, and is broadcast on over 100 radio stations. InfoWars routinely reports fake news that has led to [harassment lawsuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfoWars) against Alex Jones. InfoWars is most famous for promoting the [fake](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sandy-hook-exposed/) false flag idea that the 2012 [Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting)s were staged by actors and directed by the government. This has resulted in [numerous lawsuits](https://www.statesman.com/news/breaking-news/sandy-hook-parents-accuse-alex-jones-infowars-defamation-seek-damages/Do5eIj0ktyJJzyD8OxJkNO/) against Jones by grieving parents who lost their children in the mass shooting. Further, Jones’s attorney [admitted](http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/alex-jones-lawyer-says-infowars-host-is-a-performance-artist/) that Alex Jones was a “performance artist during a child custody case.”
In February 2018, Alex Jones was accused by former employees of
[antisemitism and sexual harassment](https://www.businessinsider.com/alex-jones-infowars-employees-complaint-about-sexual-harassment-2018-2) of women staff members. Jones denied the allegations. In August of 2018, InfoWars/Alex Jones content was [removed and banned](https://www.myajc.com/news/apple-facebook-and-other-tech-companies-delete-content-from-alex-jones/PDd8Qz1GHjQD8E8hVm7IjO/) from Facebook, Youtube, Spotify, and Apple due to a violation of community standards through hate speech promotion.

Analysis / Bias
In review, InfoWars is a Tin-Foil Hat Conspiracy multimedia source. Alex Jones has become famous for selling fake stories and debunked claims to a large audience. There are simply too many crazy conspiracies to list, and with that in mind, here are some of his more famous/infamous claims:
[The New World Order run by Pedophiles (Pizzagate)](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/alex-jones-mis-infowars-7-bat-sht-conspiracy-theories-195468/hillary-clinton-is-running-a-child-sex-ring-out-of-a-d-c-area-pizza-restaurant-118803/) [911 was an inside job](https://www.prisonplanet.com/911%E2%80%99s-accomplices-vie-for-us-presidency-obama-and-mccain-campaigns-fan-%E2%80%98war-on-terrorism%E2%80%99-hysteria.html) [San Bernardino False Flag](https://www.infowars.com/san-bernardino-false-flag-multiple-witnesses-reported-three-white-men-shooting/) [Man-made Hurricanes and Tornadoes](https://www.infowars.com/hurricane-sandy-divine-wind-for-obama/) [Mind Control Operations](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meet-alex-jones-175845/)
Editorially, Infowars presents with an extreme right-wing bias with virtually all stories favoring the right and denigrating the left, such as this:
[ADD ONE TO CLINTON BODY COUNT, JEFFREY EPSTEIN KILLED DURING SUICIDE WATCH](https://www.infowars.com/add-one-to-clinton-body-count-jeffrey-epstein-killed-during-suicide-watch/). There isn’t any evidence to support Infowars’ claim, hence why it is a conspiracy.
Failed Fact Checks
Needless to say, a
