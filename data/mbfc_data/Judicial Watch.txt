History
[Founded in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Watch) by [Larry Klayman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Klayman), Judicial Watch (JW) is an American conservative activist group that files [Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) (FOIA) lawsuits to investigate government officials’ alleged misconduct. They primarily target Democrats such as the Clinton’s, Obama, and climate scientists as they label climate science “fraud science.” Judicial Watch has made numerous false and unsubstantiated claims, with a “ [vast majority](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/judicial-watch-hillary-clinton.html)” of their lawsuits dismissed. They describe [themselves](http://www.judicialwatch.org/) as “a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation that promotes transparency, accountability, and integrity in government, politics, and the law.” The current President of JW is [Tom Fitton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Fitton).

Analysis / Bias
Judicial Watch reports news on their website using strong emotional language, usually pro-right or anti-left. Typical topics covered are anti-immigration, in which they highlight crimes committed by illegal immigrants, such as this:
[Busy Month for Illegal Immigrants Committing Heinous Crimes](https://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2018/07/busy-month-for-illegal-immigrants-committing-heinous-crimes/) or dedicating an [entire website](http://www.obamairsscandal.com/) to exposing former President Obama’s alleged IRS scandal.
They have also promoted debunked conspiracy theories such as
[this](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/mcclatchys-america/article166213202.html). Further, the founder of JW, [Larry Klayman](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/larry-klayman), recently [promoted the conspiracy](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/judicial-watch-founder-tells-pizzagate-podcast-that-the-clintons-had-people-killed/) that the Clintons were killing people. Finally, they routinely promote conspiracy theories claimed by Former President Trump that are usually debunked. See failed fact checks below. Generally, most content and story selection is anti-left and not always factual.
