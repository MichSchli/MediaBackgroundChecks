History
Launched in 2001, the
[Foundation for Defense of Democracies](http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/foundation_for_defense_of_democracies/), or FDD, is a Washington DC-based Neoconservative think tank focusing on national security and foreign policy. [Clifford D. May](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/may-clifford-d/) is the founder and President of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, and [Mark Dubowitz](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/dubowitz-mark/) is the CEO and also a former Trump adviser on Iran.
According to
[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/3f5e9fee-a3a1-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2), “Mark Dubowitz is an Iran hawk who advises the Trump administration, wants Mr. Trump to decertify the current deal to secure further leverage with Europeans.” The mission statement of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies indicates “to promote pluralism, defend democratic values and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

According to a left-leaning
[ThinkProgress article](https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-documents-shed-light-on-those-underwriting-the-foundation-for-defense-of-democracies-80976d047d1a/) dated July 19, 2011, about the major donors of FDD, “Most of the major donors are active philanthropists to ‘pro-Israel’ causes both in the U.S. and internationally. With the disclosure of its donor rolls, it becomes increasingly apparent that FDD’s advocacy of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, its hawkish stance against Iran, and its defense of right-wing Israeli policy is consistent with its donors’ interests in ‘pro-Israel’ advocacy.”
According to
[Right Web](http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/foundation_for_defense_of_democracies/), “Shortly after its founding, FDD quickly became a prominent member of a group of neoconservative think tanks and advocacy groups—including the [American Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-enterprise-institute/) and the [Hudson Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hudson-institute/)—that were influential in shaping the early foreign policy priorities of the George W. Bush administration.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies utilizes right-leaning sources such as the
[Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/) and founder Clifford May’s articles published by the Washington Times. FDD uses minimally emotional language in their headlines, such as “ [The man who would be Saudi King.”](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/the-man-who-would-be-saudi-king/) Most articles and information on the website favor Neoconservative positions that are pro-military and pro-Israel supporting the right-wing such as this [Bibi Wins!](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2022/11/04/bibi-wins/)
In general, FDD holds strongly right-leaning positions and reports news factually.
