[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Cell Metabolism Journal is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/).
