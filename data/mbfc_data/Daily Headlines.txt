Analysis / Bias
In review, Daily Headlines does not report original news but rather republishes news from other sources. Often the news is literally copied and pasted without indicating the original source. For example, this article,
[South Carolina Lawmaker Stands In Way Of Green Beret’s Dying Wish](http://dailyheadlines.net/south-carolina-lawmaker-stands-in-way-of-green-berets-dying-wish/) actually is taken word for word from [Fox46Charlotte](https://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/south-carolina-lawmaker-stands-in-way-of-green-berets-dying-wish). Headlines often utilize strong emotional wording such as this: [Thug Tries To Remove Veteran’s Flag From His Truck, Instantly Regrets It [VIDEO]](http://dailyheadlines.net/thug-tries-to-remove-veterans-flag-from-his-truck-instantly-regrets-it-video/). This story glorifies a man who pulled a gun on a black man who was protesting the confederate flag that was flying on his truck.
Many articles are not related to politics, but the ones that certainly favor the right and discredit the left. Further, they consider credible media sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) as [fake news](http://dailyheadlines.net/2017/03/fake-news-media-plays-up-kellyanne-conways-statement-on-trump-wire-tapping/). They also publish fake news stories, albeit funny, such as this: [DNC Propaganda Site USA Today Posts Disgraceful Photo Shop Photo](http://dailyheadlines.net/2016/11/dnc-propaganda-site-usa-today-posts-disgraceful-photo-shop-photo/).
