History
Founded in 2020, Dunning-Kruger-Times is a satire website created as part of the
[Last Line of Defense Network](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-resistance-the-last-line-of-defense/), a network of websites that publishes satire/fake news frequently shared by conservative sources. The founder is [Christopher Blair](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/07/one-country-biggest-publishers-fake-news-says-did-for-our-own-good/fzIDkkKZf7IbYA9oyGuzhI/story.html), who fully states his websites are satire.
Christopher Blair explains why he calls his readers Taters: “Taters” are the conservative fans of America’s Last Line of Defense. They are fragile, frightened, mostly older caucasian Americans. They believe nearly anything. While we go out of our way to educate them that not everything they agree with is true, they are still old, typically ignorant, and again — very afraid of everything.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Dunning-Kruger-Times indicates they are a satire on its
[about page](https://dunning-kruger-times.com/29-2/) that they are satire: “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie, and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental, and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you’re still having an issue with that satire thing.”
In general, stories are designed to trick conservatives into sharing on social media, such as this:

Although this site and all of Christopher Blair’s properties disclaim they are satire, they are still frequently fact-checked by fact-checkers.
