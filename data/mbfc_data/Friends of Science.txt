History
Founded in 2002, Friends of Science (FoS) is a Canadian non-profit advocacy organization based in Calgary, Alberta. The organization assumes that humans are largely not responsible for the currently observed global warming, contrary to the established
[scientific position on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change). According to their [about page](https://www.friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=1), their goal is “To educate the public about climate science and through them bring pressure to bear on governments to engage in public debates on the scientific merits of the hypothesis of human-induced global warming and the various policies that intend to address the issue.”

Funded by / Ownership
Friends of Science is a non-profit organization that does not disclose donors, however,
[Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/) claims they are primarily funded by the [Fossil Fuel Industry](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Friends_of_Science). The website provides a [donate link](https://www.friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=160).
Analysis / Bias
In review, Friends of Science is a misleading name as they do not support the consensus on human-influenced climate change. Rather, they propose that “
[the Sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change](https://friendsofscience.org/index.php?id=1),” not human activity. They argued against the [Kyoto Protocol](https://friendsofscience.org/) and are considered by [many](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Friends_of_Science) to promote human-influenced [climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). In general, this is a human-influenced Climate Change denial website that rejects the consensus of science.
