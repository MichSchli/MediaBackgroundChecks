Analysis / Bias
In review, ConservativeHQ provides a combination of original reporting and links to outside sources. Original reporting is often credited to staff, such as this
[Obama’s Ghost Haunts Coronavirus Response](http://www.conservativehq.com/article/32125-obama%E2%80%99s-ghost-haunts-coronavirus-response). This story, like some, is entirely unsourced to credible outside information. The website also features a section called “Assault on America,” which seems to date when Democrats took over the House of Representatives in November of 2018. For example, this story: [Assault on America, Day 436: Questions debate moderators should ask Bernie & Joe on Sunday](http://www.conservativehq.com/article/32123-assault-america-day-436-questions-debate-moderators-should-ask-bernie-and-joe-sunday) is sourced properly to various sources, including [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/), and the Questionable [CNS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/). Other news is directly linked to outside right-leaning sources such as [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), and the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/).
In general, ConsertvativeHQ holds a strong right bias but occasionally uses poor sources which fail fact checks.
