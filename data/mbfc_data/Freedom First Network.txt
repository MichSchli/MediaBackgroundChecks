History
[Launched in 2020,](https://whois.domaintools.com/freedomfirstnetwork.com) Freedom First Network provides links to conservative podcasts and news stories. According to their [about page](https://freedomfirstnetwork.com/about-freedom-first-network), “We are bringing together fresh patriotic and conservative voices to unveil to America.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not clearly state ownership; however, on the about page, they state, “When Jeff Dornik and JD Rucker decided to put together a venue through which patriots could work together to fight the leftist narrative, they knew there were two arenas that were under-served in media: Podcasts and videos.” This seems to imply that Jeff Dornik of The GateKeepers and JD Rucker of the Questionable

Analysis / Bias
Freedom First Network features podcasts by so-called “fresh patriotic conservatives” such as JD Rucker, Jeff Dornik, and Dustin Faulkner. The website also publishes original written news stories based on other sources and the republishing of stories from other conservative/conspiracy sources. Original articles often contain emotional headlines and wording that favor the right such as this
[After Prince Harry was Triggered by ‘Bonkers’ First Amendment, Ted Cruz Warns Him About the Second](https://freedomfirstnetwork.com/2021/05/after-prince-harry-was-triggered-by-bonkers-first-amendment-ted-cruz-warns-him-about-the-second) and conspiracy related stories [COVID-19, BLM and Gas Shortages: Are the Dems Creating this Chaos Intentionally to Establish their New World Order?](https://freedomfirstnetwork.com/2021/05/covid-19-blm-and-gas-shortages-are-the-dems-creating-this-chaos-intentionally-to-establish-their-new-world-order) Neither of these stories offers hyperlinks to support their claims.
Freedom First Network also republishes articles from discredited sources with poor fact check records such as
[Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) and [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/). Further, the website and podcasts have promoted election fraud conspiracy theories such as this [The biggest election fraud scandal in American Presidential Election History!](https://freedomfirstnetwork.com/2020/11/the-biggest-election-fraud-scandal-in-american-presidential-election-history) Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they have routinely published false and misleading information such as [The dangers of masks](https://freedomfirstnetwork.com/2021/04/the-dangers-of-masks). [Masks are not dangerous](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/), and one of the sources for this story is the anti-vaccination conspiracy website [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/). In general, Freedom First Network promotes far-right conspiracy theories.
