Analysis / Bias
In review, Grain of Truth appears to be the personal blog of an anonymous person who holds far-right conservative viewpoints. The website does not produce original content, but rather provides a snippet of news or a video and then links to an outside source. Some of the sources utilized are the right-leaning
[Toronto Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-sun/) and [MEMRI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/middle-east-media-research-institute-memri/). Story selection tends to mostly focus on anti-Islam propaganda and conspiracies such as this: [Demographic Jihad in Canada: Toronto Imam Tells Muslims to Patronize Muslim Businesses Only While Edmonton Imam Praises Justin Trudeau as Islam’s “Best Friend”.](http://grainoftruth.ca/demographic-jihad-in-canada-toronto-imam-tells-muslims-to-patronize-muslim-businesses-only-while-edmonton-imam-praises-justin-trudeau-as-islams-best-friend/) Grain of Truth also frequently is [at odds](http://grainoftruth.ca/there-is-no-climate-emergency-ppc-maxime-bernier-nails-the-truth-of-climate-change-at-rally-in-napanee-ontario/) with the consensus of science regarding human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). In general, this is simply an anti-Islam and anti-Science website.
