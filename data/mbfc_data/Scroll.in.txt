In review, Scroll.in reports, international news with low bias and they use credible left-leaning sources such as
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/), and maintain factual reporting. They use minimally loaded language in their articles and headlines such as “ [US: Explosion reported at Manhattan’s Port Authority bus terminal](https://scroll.in/latest/861141/us-explosion-reported-at-manhattan-bus-terminal)”. In reporting [national news](https://scroll.in/roving/841390/in-pictures-torrential-monsoon-rains-submerge-large-parts-of-tripura), they use factually mixed Indian sources such as the [Hindustan Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hindustan-times/)
Editorially, they are often critical of the right-leaning Modi government with articles such as this
[Not China, not Italy: India’s coronavirus lockdown is the harshest in the world](https://scroll.in/article/957564/not-china-not-italy-indias-coronavirus-lockdown-is-the-harshest-in-the-world). In general, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
