Analysis / Bias
In review, Military.com provides news as well as information about services to service members. There are separate news sections for Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the Coast Guard. The website offers original reporting that is factual and low-biased in wording such as this:
[Army Identifies Reserve Soldier Killed in Syria Vehicle Rollover](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/25/army-identifies-reserve-soldier-killed-syria-vehicle-rollover.html). However, most content comes from other outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Stars and Stripes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stars-and-stripes/), both of which we rate as [least biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/).
Editorially, a section called “opinion” tends to present balanced viewpoints such as this from a right-leaning perspective,
[The Case for Pulling US Troops Out of Africa,](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/24/case-pulling-us-troops-out-africa.html) and this from a left-leaning perspective [Betrayal of the Kurds Is a Stain on American Honor](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/10/16/betrayal-kurds-stain-american-honor.html). Military.com typically sticks to the facts when reporting on former President Trump, but sometimes they do not agree with his [foreign policy](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/09/house-approves-measure-restrain-trumps-actions-iran.html). In general, they report factually and with minimal bias.
