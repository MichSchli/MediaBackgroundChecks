History
Founded in 2016, Indivisible is a progressive movement and organization in the United States initiated as a reaction to the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.
According to their
[about page](https://indivisible.org/about), “Indivisible was founded in response to Trump’s election – but we know that Trump is a symptom of a sick democracy, not its cause. We face two fundamental problems: first, our democracy was rigged from the start in favor of the white and wealthy. Second, in the last few decades, an alliance of white nationalists and the ultra-rich have been actively working to further undermine democracy and cement their hold on power permanently. That’s how we ended up with Trump.”
The Indivisible Movement is composed of
[three separate organizations](https://indivisible.org/how-to-give):
- Indivisible Project (501c4) drives coordinated campaigns, powering the grassroots Indivisible movement to defeat the rightwing takeover of American government and win an inclusive democracy and bold progressive policies.
- Indivisible Civics (501c3) provides movement coordination, resources, training, and tools to fuel a powerful and aligned national movement of Indivisible groups and activists to organize for change.
- Indivisible Action (PAC) channels grassroots energy into electing progressive candidates who will work towards an inclusive democracy that provides for the needs of all people, and to defeat politicians who will stand in its way.

Analysis / Bias
Indivisible makes it very clear they are left-biased with a statement on the
[homepage](https://indivisible.org/) that reads “DEFEAT MAGA. SAVE DEMOCRACY: Right now, we are facing the interlocking catastrophes of a rigged democracy, global pandemic, unimaginable and growing wealth inequality, racial injustice, and the escalating impacts of the climate crisis. We’re fighting back. People like you are leading local Indivisible groups in every single state. Be part of history—join the Indivisible movement.”
Indivisible primarily serves as an advocacy and lobbying group for Democratic politicians and policy. The website also features a blog that uses loaded emotional wording such as this
[It’s official: Donald Trump is running for president…again.](https://indivisibleteam.medium.com/its-official-donald-trump-is-running-for-president-again-80f3efa46ece) A quote from the article reads, “Tonight’s deplorable announcement comes after voters across the country issued a resounding rejection of MAGA through last week’s midterm elections, but we know Trump and his cronies are not backing down.”
Editorially, all stories and advocacy favor the progressive left while consistently denigrating conservatives and former President Trump. In general, the information is fact-based and editorially holds a strong left-leaning bias.
