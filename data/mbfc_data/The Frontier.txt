We will shine a light on hypocrisy, fraud, abuse, and wrongdoing at all levels in our community and state.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Frontier produces long-form investigative journalism pieces with minimal use of loaded language such as this:
[More than 40 Oklahoma officers banned for sex crime convictions in last five years, records show](https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/more-than-40-oklahoma-officers-banned-for-sex-crime-convictions-in-last-five-years/). This story, like all others on the website, is properly sourced to credible media outlets, quotes, and first-person accounts. Story selection tends to favor the left, with many investigations covering [abuse by police](https://www.readfrontier.org/special-projects/shot-by-shot-oklahoma-officer-involved-shootings-in-2019/), [social injustice](https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/attorneys-in-ada-innocent-man-murder-case-say-they-were-blown-away-by-content-of-newly-discovered-documents-ask-for-publics-help/), and [environmental issues.](https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/we-are-doomed-citizen-epa-comments-on-pruitt-show-depth-of-concern/) Further, The Frontier is a [local newsroom](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/06/08/propublica-names-6-more-newsrooms-to-its-local-reporting-network/) for the Pulitzer Prize-winning [ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/06/08/propublica-names-6-more-newsrooms-to-its-local-reporting-network/).
In general, this is a factual publication that leans left editorially.
