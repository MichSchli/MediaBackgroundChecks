Analysis / Bias
In review, Spectrum Report has a feature similar to
[Allsides.com](https://www.allsides.com) in that they curate news stories from left and right sources and place them side by side. They currently use 3 left-leaning sources: [Huff Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), [Think Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/think-progress/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), and 3 right-leaning sources, [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), and [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/). They also have a [fun feature](http://spectrumreport.com/game-page/) where they display a headline, and you have to pick which of these 6 sources it came from. There is very little original content on the site other than news curation. While the site’s intent is fair, some of the sources are considered crackpot conspiracy, such as Infowars.
Failed Fact Checks
- They have never been fact checked by a third party as they curate news from other sources.\
