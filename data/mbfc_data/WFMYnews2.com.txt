Analysis / Bias
In review, Wfmynews2 reports local news primarily through TV news videos and accompanying text. Local news is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[Natty Greene’s Brewing Company files for chapter 7 bankruptcy](https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/local/natty-greenes-brewing-company-files-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy/83-c79fc1cc-5fd0-4dcc-8219-2de72bd8cc76). National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other TEGNA TV stations.
Wfmynews2 also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local NC politics through reporters. Again, the wording is low-biased such as this:
[Nearly 5,000 mail-in ballots have been rejected in NC. Here’s why](https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/politics/elections/why-mail-in-ballots-are-rejected-and-how-to-check-ballot-status/275-451bcd14-3467-441d-b617-04c9de7eb845). Further, the website does not publish editorial commentary. Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
