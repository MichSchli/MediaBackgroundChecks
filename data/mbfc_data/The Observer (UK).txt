Analysis / Bias
In review, The Observer is a Sunday only paper published by the Guardian. Articles and headlines contain emotional wording that typically favors the left such as this:
[How did Britain fail so badly in dealing with Covid-19?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/100-days-later-how-did-britain-fail-so-badly-in-dealing-with-covid-19). This story links directly into the Guardian Domain. Editorially, The Observer denigrates the right such as this [The right cannot resist a culture war against the ‘liberal elite’, even now](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/09/the-right-cannot-resist-a-culture-war-against-the-liberal-elite-even-now). In the most simple terms, the online version of The Observer is actually the Guardian. In general, The Observer is moderately left-biased.
