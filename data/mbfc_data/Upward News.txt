Analysis / Bias
Upward News exhibits a mixed approach in its news reporting, showing some balance in coverage. While the site does lean towards a right-center perspective in its editorial content, it also includes stories that are less ideologically driven. For instance, in their coverage of various political figures, they provide articles on both
[Joe Biden](https://www.upward.news/tag/biden/) and [Donald Trump](https://www.upward.news/tag/trump/), offering insights into different political viewpoints. However, reporting on Trump is more favorable: [Trump’s Candidacy Threatened in Colorado Trial](https://www.upward.news/trumps-candidacy-threatened-colorado-trial/). This approach indicates an effort to present a range of perspectives, although the depth and tone of coverage can vary, leaning more towards a conservative viewpoint.
Upward News generally sources its information adequately, often linking to established news outlets and providing references for its claims. For example, in their articles tagged under
[politics](https://www.upward.news/tag/politics/), they frequently cite sources like [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [AP News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and other recognized media outlets.
A notable example of editorial bias is evident in the article
[“The NSA Goes Full Woke Mode](https://www.upward.news/nsa-goes-full-woke/).” This piece criticizes the National Security Agency’s policies on social justice and equity, using charged language and framing these policies in a negative light. The choice of words and the overall tone of the article reflect a right-leaning bias, aligning with conservative viewpoints that often challenge progressive policies in government institutions.
