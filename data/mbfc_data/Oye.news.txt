History
Founded in 2011 as written on their about page, although a
[Whois search](http://whois.domaintools.com/oye.news) shows the domain to be registered in 2016. Who knows? The [about page](https://www.oye.news/about-us/) for Oye.news describes themselves as “Real News & Critical Thinking”, has been our slogan for some time as it accurately describes what we are all about.” The website does not disclose ownership and all articles are published by [Ceribalius](https://www.oye.news/author/oyeadmin/), who does not offer a bio. A search of Twitter turns up [CeribaliusBassi](https://twitter.com/ceribalius) who claims to be the owner of Oye.news. The bottom line, this source completely lacks transparency.

Oye.news does not disclose ownership. It appears revenue is derived strictly through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Oye.news is a low factual source that routinely publishes fake news, conspiracies, and pseudoscience. For example, they often publish
[anti-vaccination information](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this: [‘Vaccines are Safe & Effective’ – A Cult Driven by Blind Faith](https://www.oye.news/news/health/vaccines/vaccines-are-safe-effective-a-cult-driven-by-blind-faith/). They also publish information on dangerous [alternative medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) practices such as [Chelation](https://www.oye.news/news/freedoms/media-calls-for-further-book-burning/), which has been [debunked](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/expert-answers/chelation-therapy/faq-20157449). They [reject](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) human-influenced [climate change ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/)and that [GMO’s are safe](https://www.oye.news/news/health/monsantos-gmo-herbicide-doubles-cancer-risk/). They further promote common conspiracies such as [false flags](https://www.oye.news/news/government/uk-parliament-dissolves-for-possible-syrian-invasion-with-another-false-flag-sarin-attack/) and the [New World Order](https://www.oye.news/news/government/the-new-world-order-is-already-here/). Add in Aliens and the fact that they designed the site to look like the BBC and you have a one of the kind Imposter/Questionable/Conspiracy/Pseudoscience website. This website does not appear to have a political bias, but rather a strong bias against science in general, and 100% lack credibility on any level.
