Analysis / Bias
In review, Forbes’
[Coverage of China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/12/14/chinese-ownership-is-raising-questions-about-the-editorial-independence-of-a-major-u-s-magazine/?utm_term=.82c8698f8c55) has been criticized due to Chinese ownership, with the Washington Post reporting that it “raises questions about their editorial independence.” Forbes publishes controversial articles such as a cover story by Dinesh D’Souza, which Columbia Journalism Review has criticized [:](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-journalism-review/) [“Forbes’ Shameful Piece on Obama as the “Other”](https://archives.cjr.org/the_audit/forbes_shameful_obama_dinesh_dsouza.php) and another [article](https://archives.cjr.org/the_audit/forbes_compares_obama_lenin_racist_bs_sanity.php) was written by editor-in-chief Steve Forbes that compares former President Obama to Lenin. Forbes also publishes news articles with minimally loaded words such as this: “ [Google CEO Sundar Pichai Answered Congressional Questions On China, Privacy, Political Bias And More](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2018/12/11/follow-along-with-google-ceo-sundar-pichais-testimony-before-congress-here-1/#335e08d63272),” and [“ U.S. Arresting Huawei CFO Creates Huge Uncertainty For The Markets And Trade Talks.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2018/12/06/u-s-arresting-huawei-cfo-creates-huge-uncertainty-for-the-markets-and-trade-talks/#2dd9cf6b38ce) They also source credible media outlets such as judiciary.house.gov, [financialpost.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-post/), and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/).
Politically, Forbes presents a reasonable balance through their contributors; however, when looking at
[articles pertaining to Trump](https://www.forbes.com/search/?q=trump#5726d9dd279f), there are more in favor of his policies than against.
A factual search reveals that Forbes has produced a
[misleading claim](http://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-story-claiming-forbes-said-duterte-pro), according to an IFCN fact-checker. Although Forbes is usually evidence-based when it comes to science, they do not always support the consensus regarding [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). For example, they have employed James Taylor as a columnist who writes [anti-climate science propaganda](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/05/19/updated-nasa-data-polar-ice-not-receding-after-all/#7d2ec3962892) and has connections to the questionable [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/) and Exxon-Mobil. They have also published articles by [Roy Spencer](https://www.desmogblog.com/roy-spencer), who has a long track record of human-influenced climate change denial. Spencer has also been a speaker for the Heartland Institute and has connections to the [fossil fuel industry](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Roy_Spencer). Lastly, Forbes has published several articles rated [Very Low for Science Credibility](https://climatefeedback.org/outlet/forbes/) by IFCN fact checker [Climate Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-feedback/).
