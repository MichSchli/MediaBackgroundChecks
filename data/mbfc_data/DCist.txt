Analysis / Bias
In review, the DCist covers local news on crime, culture, and entertainment for the DC area. Articles and headlines offer minimally loaded emotional language such as this
[Fairfax County Removes Confederate Monuments From Courthouse Property](https://dcist.com/story/20/11/06/fairfax-county-removes-confederate-monuments-from-courthouse/) and this [Nadeau Announces Police Accountability Bill After Bowser Moves $43 Million To Cover MPD Overtime Costs](https://dcist.com/story/20/11/06/dc-council-brianne-nadeau-police-mpd-overtime-spending-accountability-bill/). When it comes to sourcing they utilize credible sources such as police reports and .gov’s. The website also republishes stories from WAMU as well as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, the DCist does not really publish op-eds, however, they do have a section called
[“editor’s picks”](https://dcist.com/topic/editors-picks/) that publishes stories with a slight left-leaning bias such as this [The New White House Fence Is Getting Covered In Protest Art](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/07/the-new-white-house-fence-is-getting-covered-in-protest-art/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
