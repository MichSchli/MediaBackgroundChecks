Analysis / Bias
[According](https://rsf.org/en/jordan) to [Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/), “Jordan’s media censor themselves and avoid subjects that are implicitly off-limits.” They further state, “Journalists are subject to close surveillance by the intelligence services and must be affiliated to the state-controlled Jordanian Press Association.” Jordan’s government is a Parliamentary Monarchy, with King Abdullah II serving as leader. King Abdullah II and Jordan are considered the [most moderate](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/monarch-in-the-middle/309270/) Islamic nation in the Arab World.
The Jordan Times covers national news with minimally loaded wording such as this
[9 COVID deaths, 675 virus cases recorded Sunday](https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/9-covid-deaths-675-virus-cases-recorded-sunday). However, when reporting on Israel, they tend to use more emotional wording such as this [Jordan slams Israel for allowing extremist break-ins at Al Aqsa](https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/jordan-slams-israel-allowing-extremist-break-ins-al-aqsa). When reporting on world news, they republish news articles from AFP. Finally, when reporting on USA news, they again use little bias in wording such as this [King, US president hold summit meeting at White House](https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/king-us-president-hold-summit-meeting-white-house).
Editorially, The Jordan Times rarely criticizes the government and often praises the King such as this
[King Abdullah’s glorious record](http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/hasan-abu-nimah/king-abdullah%E2%80%99s-glorious-record-%C2%A0). It is difficult to rate this source from a Left-Right perspective because some stories promote left-leaning positions such as climate change and gender rights, while others promote Islam. However, one constant is pro-government propaganda.
