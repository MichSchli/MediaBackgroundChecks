Analysis / Bias
In review, Act.TV presents news with a left-wing bias as all articles and videos favor liberal policy. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines and articles such as
[If You Thought Paul Ryan was Bad, Meet the Racist Running for His Seat](http://act.tv/articles/paul-ryan-paul-nehlen). Articles are generally well-sourced, and videos come from other left-biased sources, such as [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/) and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/).
