History
[Founded in 2011](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tn/001102466) by sports commentator [Clay Travis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Travis), OutKick is a sports news website featuring conservative political opinions. The website lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page or disclose ownership. In 2021, [Clay Travis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/clay-travis-bias-rating/) and [Buck Sexton](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/buck-sexton-bias-rating/) formed a conservative radio program that took over [Rush Limbaugh’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/) radio time slot.

Analysis / Bias
In review, OutKick primarily covers professional and college sports news such as Baseball, Basketball, Football, Hockey, and Golf. All stories are tagged to their groups, such as NFL or Gambling. Sports news articles and headlines tend to have sensationalized headlines such as this
[Oklahoma Placeholder Spencer Jones Gets Absolutely Destroyed During Bar Bathroom Fight](https://www.outkick.com/oklahoma-placeholder-spencer-jones-gets-absolutely-destroyed-during-bar-bathroom-fight/). Sports articles are generally appropriately sourced.
Editorially, OutKick features a Politics tag that primarily publishes political news related to sports and sometimes social issues. Political reporting often favors the right by promoting a conservative perspective such as this
[TED CRUZ CRUSHES JACK DORSEY ON TECH CENSORSHIP](https://www.outkick.com/ted-cruz-crushes-jack-dorsey-on-tech-censorship/) and this [TRUMP DOMINATING EARLY 2024 PRIMARY POLL; DESANTIS THE BEST OPTION?](https://www.outkick.com/2024-polls-trump/).
There is evidence that Outkick occasionally publishes articles that promote misinformation. For example, they frequently promote
[anti-mask propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) related to covid-19 [TOP INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT WARNS DOUBLE-MASKING CAN ENHANCE CHANCES OF INFECTION](https://www.outkick.com/two-masks-covid/). While this article and the others are not saying that you shouldn’t wear a mask, the frequent negative reporting on mask-wearing may be misleading to some. They have also promoted information about vaccines with statements such as this “We were right. [The COVID-19 vaccinations don’t do jack squat.”](https://www.outkick.com/yankees-red-sox-postponed-due-to-covid-outbreak-despite-75-percent-vaccination-status/) This statement is false as vaccines have proven very effective at preventing hospitalization and death. In general, news reporting is not always factual and promotes a one-sided conservative bias.
