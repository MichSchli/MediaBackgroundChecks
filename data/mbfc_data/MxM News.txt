Analysis / Bias
MxM News curates news stories from various publishers across the ideological spectrum, including
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), [Yahoo News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/), [Fox News,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), [AP,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). However, MxM mostly curates content from right-leaning sources, potentially indicating a bias towards conservative viewpoints. As they primarily curate news stories from right-leaning and factually questionable sources (Breitbart, [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/)), MxM News often covers controversial topics, such as [‘trans refuge’ bill strips parental rights,”](https://mxmnews.com/news/critics-minn-trans-refuge-bill-strips-parental-rights) [“France bans TikTok from govt. Phones,”](https://mxmnews.com/news/france-bans-tiktok-from-govt-phones) [ “Media twists itself into knots covering transgender school shooter,”](https://mxmnews.com/news/media-twists-itself-into-knots-covering-transgender-school-shooter) and [“Wisconsin school bans Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton pro-LGBT song](https://mxmnews.com/news/wisconsin-school-bans-miley-cyrus-dolly-parton-pro-lgbt-song).
As evidenced above, MxM favors a conservative perspective through story selection that favors the right and sometimes aggregates news stories from questionable sources with poor fact-check records.
