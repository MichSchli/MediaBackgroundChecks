[IWF is funded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Women%27s_Forum) by Donors Trust, the John William Pope Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Scaife Foundations, the Randolph Foundation, and the John M. Olin Foundation.
Analysis / Bias
The IWF publishes stories with moderately loaded emotional headlines such as “
[CNN Threatens to ID the Guy Behind the Trump WWE Gif If He Offends CNN Again](http://iwf.org/blog/2804238/CNN-Threatens-to-ID-the-Guy-Behind-the-Trump-WWE-Gif-If-He-Offends-CNN-Again-).” Their articles are always well-sourced from credible media; however, most favor the right and endorse right-wing issues.
IWF’s primary issue is anti-feminism, with articles like this:
[Why Modern Feminism and Third Wave Movement Do Not Speak for Most Women](http://www.iwf.org/blog/2804960/Why-Modern-Feminism-and-Third-Wave-Movement-Do-Not-Speak-for-Most-Women). They also oppose transgender athletes competing in women’s sports, such as this [Rally to Tell the NCAA to Stop Discriminating Against Female Athletes.](https://www.iwf.org/2023/01/06/media-advisory-rally-to-tell-the-ncaa-to-stop-discriminating-against-female-athletes/) In general, IWF is strongly right-biased and mostly factual in reporting.
