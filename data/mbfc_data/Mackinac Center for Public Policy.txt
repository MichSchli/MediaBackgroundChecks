Funded by / Ownership
The Mackinac Center is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. According to their about page, the Mackinac Center “neither seeks nor accepts any government funding. It enjoys the support of foundations, individuals, and businesses who share a concern for Michigan’s future and recognize the important role of free markets and economic liberty.” However, it lacks transparency by not listing top donors.
[Some known donors](https://www.energyandpolicy.org/mackinac-center-for-public-policy/) are Dow Chemical, Cornerstone Foundation, and the Charles G. Koch Foundation.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Mackinac Center publishes an agenda that includes
[Protecting Taxpayers and Entrepreneurs](https://www.mackinac.org/Fiscal), [Revitalizing Healthcare for Patients and Providers,](https://www.mackinac.org/healthcare) [Removing Government Barriers to Prosperity](https://www.mackinac.org/licensure). In the simplest terms, they advocate for limited government and free-market capitalism. The website also features a blog that aligns with a libertarian agenda such as this: [The Safety Net Already There: Unemployment Insurance](https://www.mackinac.org/the-safety-net-already-there-unemployment-insurance). This story is properly sourced to the Department of Labor.
Editorially, the Mackinac Center is not critical of President Trump, but they do encourage him to follow a free-market model such as this:

When it comes to science, Mackinac does not deny the human influence on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); however, they do question the severity of models and suggest free-market solutions, which does not entirely align with the consensus. In general, reporting is mostly factual and with a strong libertarian bias.
