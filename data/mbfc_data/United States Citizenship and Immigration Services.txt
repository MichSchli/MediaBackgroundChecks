History
[Formed in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services), The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is an agency of the [United States Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security) (DHS) that administers the country’s naturalization and immigration system. It is a successor to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which was dissolved by the [Homeland Security Act of 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Security_Act_of_2002) and replaced by three components within the DHS: USCIS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Funded by / Ownership
The USCIS is a part of the United States government and is directly funded through the federal budget. In 2021, the budget was
[$4.235 billion](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/dhs_bib_-_web_version_-_final_508.pdf).
Analysis / Bias
According to its
[mission statement](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us): “USCIS upholds America’s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility with fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve.” They further describe their role as a “government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. We are 19,000 government employees and contractors working at more than 200 offices across the world.”
The USCIS website primarily serves as an information portal on legal immigration matters. It provides documents and instructions on how to apply for Green Cards and Citizenship. It also lists immigration laws and how they work.
Regarding bias, they have a link for their newsroom that focuses on news directly related to the USCIS, such as this
[USCIS to Implement Next Phase of Premium Processing for Certain Previously Filed EB-1 and EB-2 Form I-140 Petitions](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-to-implement-next-phase-of-premium-processing-for-certain-previously-filed-eb-1-and-eb-2-form).
Generally, the bias of USCIS is determined by the government. For example,
[in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/uscis-nation-of-immigrants.html), the Trump administration removed the phrase “America’s promise as a nation of immigrants,” which drew criticism from immigration rights advocates. This reflected the administration’s right-leaning position on immigration. Democratic President Joe Biden added the phrase back when elected. Therefore, with Joe Biden as President, the agency reflects a more left-leaning bias toward immigration.
