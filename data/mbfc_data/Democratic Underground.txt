History
[Founded in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Underground), Democratic Underground, also known as DU, is an online community for U.S. Democrats. Its membership is restricted by policy to those who support the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates for political office. According to its [mission statement](https://www.democraticunderground.com/?com=aboutus): “Democratic Underground is an online community where politically liberal people can do their part to effect political and social change by Interacting with friendly, like-minded people; Sharing news and information, free from the corporate media filter; Participating in lively, thought-provoking discussions; Helping elect more Democrats to political office at all levels of American government, and having fun!” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Democratic Underground is a forum community that posts news and discussions from a liberal perspective. The website features the latest breaking news in which users publish snippets of news stories from other sources with a hyperlink to that source. For example, this story:
[Pence aide testified that Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine were ‘inappropriate’](https://www.democraticunderground.com/10142396263) provides a few paragraphs of the story and then links to the full story at the credible [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/).
News articles published in the forums are beyond the control of the Democratic Underground, with some coming from sources that are not credible. Again, this is not the fault of Democratic Underground but does reveal that there may be false information published on this website. The bias and level of factual content found on this website are determined by the individual posters and not Democratic Underground.
