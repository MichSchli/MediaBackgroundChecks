Analysis / Bias
The Independent Minute does not appear to publish original content but rather serve as a curated news aggregation website. Typically, they publish a full article with a link to the source or a short snippet that links offsite to the source. The Independent Minute leaves the original headlines, which often contain highly emotional wording that favors the right such as this
[What They Just Revealed About Disposable Face Masks Will Make You…](https://independentminute.com/2022/09/01/what-they-just-revealed-about-disposable-face-masks-will-make-you/). The website also features sensationalized clickbait news stories such as [This Confessed Surgery Addict Had Something New To Show Off, And It….](https://independentminute.com/2022/09/02/this-confessed-surgery-addict-had-something-new-to-show-off-and-it/)
For news aggregation sites, we check the quality of the sources they utilize. In this case, Independent Minute almost exclusively relies on far-right Questionable or Conspiracy websites for political reporting, such as the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [American Web Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-web-media-awm/). The Independent Minute generally holds a far-right editorial bias through story selection and consistently rely on poor sources who routinely fail fact checks.
