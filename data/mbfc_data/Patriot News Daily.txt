History
[Founded in 2014](http://whois.domaintools.com/patriotnewsdaily.com), and according to their [about page](http://patriotnewsdaily.com/about/): “PatriotNewsDaily is more than just another conservative news and opinion site. We’re guided by an unending and unbreakable pride in the United States of America. Regardless of who happens to currently occupy the government, we believe that patriotism is about more than blindly supporting the guy in office. We believe that it means something to be an American, a citizen of the most exceptional country that mankind has ever devised. We don’t think being a patriot is anything to be ashamed of; to the contrary, we wear the badge with honor. We will until the day we die or the country becomes something completely unrecognizable.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Patriot News Daily is a borderline extreme right-wing biased news and opinion website. All news stories favor the right and disparage the left. The Patriot News Daily uses
[highly sensationalized headlines](http://patriotnewsdaily.com/unhinged-clemson-professor-calls-trump-supporters-racist-scum/) that serve as clickbait. Not all information is sourced and at times they use questionable sources such as the late Rush Limbaugh, who has a [very poor track record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/) with fact-checkers.
Failed Fact Checks
- None directly. They use sources who have failed fact checks.
