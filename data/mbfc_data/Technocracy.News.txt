History
[Founded in 2015](https://whois.domaintools.com/technocracy.news) by author Patrick Wood, Technocracy News is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website that reports on technology, and its supposed dangers that lead to government control. According to the [about page](https://www.technocracy.news/about/), Patrick Wood describes himself as “An economist by education, a financial analyst and writer by profession and an American Constitutionalist by choice; Wood maintains a Biblical world view and has deep historical insights into the modern attacks on sovereignty, property rights, and personal freedom. Such attacks are epitomized by the implementation of U.N. policies such as Agenda 21, Sustainable Development, Smart Growth, and in education, the widespread adoption of Common Core State Standards.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Technocracy News frequently publishes conspiracy theories and promotes pseudoscience. Many articles are written by Patrick Wood, with others republished from right-leaning sources such as the questionable
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and conspiracy website [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). They also [republish](https://www.technocracy.news/former-trilateral-commission-member-susan-rice-floated-for-bidens-vp-pick/) from credible sources such as [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/); however, they add biased commentary such as this: “Rice is a globalist of the first order and tightly connected with members of the Trilateral Commission. As a former Ambassador to the UN and then-National Security Advisor to Obama, it is not surprising that she would be on Biden’s shortlist. ⁃ TN Editor.”
Story selection often favors the right with great concern over Globalism and the New World Order such as this
[IMF Reveals That Cryptocurrency Is The New World Order Endgame](https://www.technocracy.news/imf-reveals-that-cryptocurrency-is-the-new-world-order-endgame/). This story comes from the conspiracy website [Alt-Market](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/alt-market/). They also frequently promote conspiracy theories about [5G](https://www.technocracy.news/scientists-5g-network-could-lower-sperm-counts-and-sterilize-young-men/) and [Agenda 21](https://www.technocracy.news/local-agenda-2030-inspired-decades-old-local-agenda-21/). Further, they routinely publish misinformation regarding the [CoronaVirus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/), such as this [CDC Sent Useless Test Kits To States, Tainted With Coronavirus](https://www.technocracy.news/cdc-sent-useless-test-kits-to-states-tainted-with-coronavirus/). Coronavirus test kits are not tained. This is a [false claim](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/08/facebook-posts/batch-faulty-cdc-covid-19-tests-didnt-contain-live/). Finally, they routinely promote [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and support the claim that [Human Influenced Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is a hoax [Dr. Tim Ball: Why People Continue To Believe Global Warming Hoax](https://www.technocracy.news/dr-tim-ball-why-people-continue-to-believe-global-warming-hoax/). In general, this is a website that frequently publishes misleading or false information from a far-right perspective.
