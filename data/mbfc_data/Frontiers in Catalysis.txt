Analysis / Bias
Frontiers in Catalysis is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to Chemistry. The journal primarily publishes research like this
[Theoretical investigation of catalytic n-butane isomerization over H-SSZ-13](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fctls.2023.1213803/abstract).
[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
However, Frontiers in Catalysis is a credible scientific journal, as we have not found any controversy or significant retractions. Although, Frontiers Media has
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
