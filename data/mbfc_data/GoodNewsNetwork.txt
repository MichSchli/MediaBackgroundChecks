Analysis / Bias
In review, the purpose of the GoodNewsNetwork is to publish news that is uplifting, positive, and most importantly, not negative. For the most part, they summarize stories from other sources such as
[NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). The key theme is stories are positive or have a happy ending. For example, this story [Town Surprises UPS Driver With $1,000 to Thank Him For Being Essential During Pandemic](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/town-surprises-ups-driver-with-1000-dollars/).
