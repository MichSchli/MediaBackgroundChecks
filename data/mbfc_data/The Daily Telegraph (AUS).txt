Analysis / Bias
In 2020,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Australia 26/180 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/australia) stating, [“Investigative journalism in danger](https://rsf.org/en/australia).” The Prime Minister of Australia is Center-Right Conservative [Scott Morrison](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45292331). [ The Liberal-National Coalition](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48331125), known as The Coalition, an alliance of center-right political parties with Morrison serving as the leader. In the 2019 elections, most Murdoch-owned papers endorsed The Coalition.
In review, The Daily Telegraph publishes misleading opinion columns with emotionally loaded wording such as this article
[“WHAT MADNESS CAN JUSTIFY MUTILATING OUR CHILDREN”](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/blogs/miranda-devine/Department+of+Education) According to [The Australian Press Council](https://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/adj-1757/), this column is misleading. Sky News, as well as news.com.au, provides national and international news.
Editorially, there is a distinct conservative bias in political positions. For example, they frequently downplay
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and the Coronavirus [Climate change activist Malcolm Turnbull ‘hijacks’ coronavirus alarmism](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/climate-change-activist-malcolm-turnbull-hijacks-coronavirus-alarmism/video/f1631afe50be9e33455db154a223c602). They also report negatively against left-leaning parties such as this [Labour’s Association with the Greens is dangerous for Australia.](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/labors-association-with-the-greens-is-dangerous-for-australia-kenny/video/a6c992384ab39877d489f89072fb3be1) Finally, in 2019, they endorsed conservative Scott Morrison for Prime Minister, [Daily Telegraph editorial: Steady hand on the tiller beats rhetoric](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/the-telegraph-says-steady-hand-on-the-tiller-beats-rhetoric/news-story/21fd5bb6fda948e277d3b1e8ab7f627b).
Finally, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 47% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 22% do not, ranking them last in trust of the major Australian news providers. In general, the Daily Telegraph holds right-leaning editorial views and does not always report news factually.
