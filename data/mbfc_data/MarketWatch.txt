Analysis / Bias
In review, MarketWatch provides a stock ticker at the top of the page and financial news. All articles list the author and are appropriately sourced. Headlines are generally free of significant loaded words such as this:
[Mueller concludes Russia probe, delivers report to the attorney general](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mueller-concludes-russia-probe-delivers-report-to-the-attorney-general-2019-03-22?mod=newsviewer_click&mod=mw_theo_homepage). Editorially, MarketWatch tends to favor the right when it comes to economic philosophy.
