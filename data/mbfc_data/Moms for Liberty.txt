History
[Founded in January 2021](https://www.momsforliberty.org/about/), Moms for Liberty is an organization that started as a response to pandemic restrictions and mask mandates in schools. The founders, Tiffany Justice, Tina Descovich, and Bridget Ziegler, were former Florida school board members who sought to rally like-minded individuals to oppose these restrictions. Bridget Ziegler is married to County Commissioner and Vice Chair of the Republican Party of Florida, [Christian Ziegler](https://glaad.org/gap/moms-liberty/), who [attended](https://www.wfla.com/news/sarasota-county/sarasota-county-commissioner-reacts-to-chaos-at-u-s-capitol-after-attending-d-c-rally-during-work-trip/) the rally that preceded the insurrection on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.
The organization has since grown into a nationwide network with over 200 branches that promotes anti-LGBTQ propaganda and

Funded by / Ownership
Moms for Liberty is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization. The specifics of its funding sources are unclear. They also have connections with the
[Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/), as they were awarded the 2022 [Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship](https://www.heritage.org/article/the-salvatori-prize-american-citizenship). Further, the conservative [Heiress of Publix](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/20/moms-liberty-pac-publix-heiress-00046921) was one of the first to donate over 50K to the organization. Finally, a [Tampa Bay Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tampa-bay-times/) article suggests that the organization may be [connected](https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2022/07/09/just-who-is-behind-moms-for-liberty-column/) to the Council for National Policy, a secretive network of right-wing billionaires and Christian fundamentalist leaders.
Analysis / Bias
Moms for Liberty has evolved from its initial focus on pandemic restrictions to opposing teaching about racism and racist history and LGBTQ+-inclusive policies in public schools. The organization has been active in campaigning for seats on school boards, and several of its members and supporters now hold such positions.
[The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) has listed Moms for Liberty as an [‘anti-government extremist’ organization](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/06/06/splc-moms-for-liberty-anti-government-extremist-group/70289379007/) due to its efforts to ‘attack public education, ban books, and remove any curriculum that contains discussions of race, discrimination, and LGBTQ+ identities.’
The organization has close ties to the Republican party, particularly in Florida, where it has received support from
[Governor Ron DeSantis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-political-bias-profile/). It has supported and utilized laws like Florida’s so-called ‘Don’t say gay’ statute, which limits classroom discussion of gender and sexual identity.
As mentioned above Moms for Liberty may be part of a larger network of right-wing organizations, potentially connected to the Council for National Policy. This could indicate a broader political agenda beyond the organization’s stated goals. In general, they are a far-right group that promotes propaganda to advance its conservative agenda.
