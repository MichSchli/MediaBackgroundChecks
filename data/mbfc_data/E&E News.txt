Analysis / Bias
After analyzing dozens of articles, we highlight a few, such as this first article, “
[DeSantis loves to talk Everglades, not Climate](https://www.eenews.net/articles/desantis-loves-to-talk-everglades-not-climate/),” which frames [Ron DeSantis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-political-bias-profile/) in a complex light regarding environmental issues. The wording like “not a global warming person,” “greenwashing,” and “2-percent Ron” suggests a critical tone towards DeSantis’ environmental stance, hinting at a left-leaning bias.
On the other hand, the piece also acknowledges DeSantis’ efforts in the Everglades restoration, portraying a balanced view to some extent. There’s a mix of quotations from both supporters and critics of DeSantis, which offers a varied viewpoint., although the critical tone seems more pronounced.
Meanwhile, the article
[Senate fails to override Biden veto of ESA rollbacks](https://www.eenews.net/articles/senate-fails-to-override-biden-veto-of-esa-rollbacks/) leans towards supporting environmental protections, demonstrating a supportive tone towards [Biden’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) vetoes. The article adheres to a factual reporting style by mentioning precise voting numbers and statements from President Biden. The article maintains an objective approach by including direct quotes and hyperlinked sources. Both articles utilize factual references to support their narratives and provide cited references to credible outlets like [WLRN](https://www.wlrn.org/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tampa-bay-times/), [TCPalm](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tcpalm/), [Miami Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/miami-herald/), and [WhiteHouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/).
