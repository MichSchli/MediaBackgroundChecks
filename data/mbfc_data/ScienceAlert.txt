Analysis / Bias
In review, ScienceAlert produces original science news content with minimal bias, such as this:
[For The First Time, Physicists Have Produced a Stunning Type of Plasma Jet in The Lab](https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-physicists-have-produced-a-stunning-plasma-jet-in-the-lab). This story is sourced to the [Astrophysical Journal Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab07bd/meta). The website features a tab for Politics and Society that promotes a left-leaning bias with stories such as this: [Here’s How a Universal Basic Income Can Help Us Mitigate The Climate Emergency.](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-universal-income-can-help-us-mitigate-our-climate-emergency-here-s-how?perpetual=yes&limitstart=1) While your reviewer may agree or disagree with this plan, at this time, it aligns with the political left. The website also includes content from [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/).
