Analysis / Bias
In review, HonestReporting reports on the news where they perceive that Israel was portrayed unfairly. Many stories are negative toward Palestine and attempt to portray Israel as a victim, such as this
[Reuters Ignores Palestinian Rejectionism and Violence as Cause of Conflict](https://honestreporting.com/reuters-ignores-palestinian-rejectionism-and-violence-as-cause-of-conflict/).
We are not saying they are wrong, simply that the opinion may be biased based on where one stands. With that said, this website is 100% biased in favor of Israel and generally favors the political right with stories such as this
[HR Supports ADL Against Far-Left Cancel Culture](https://honestreporting.com/hr-supports-adl-against-far-left-cancel-culture/). This story is credibly sourced to the [ADL](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/), [Forward](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-forward/), and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, they hold pro-Israel nationalist positions in favor of
[Benjamin Netanyahu](https://honestreporting.com/ibn-20203009-hezbollah-covid-19-antisemitism/) and the current nationalist parties. Some might call them a propaganda source.
