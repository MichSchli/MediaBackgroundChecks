Analysis / Bias
In our review of content from Dr. Morse’s platforms, we focused on a selection of content to identify potential biases.
In a
[blog post](https://drmorses.com/blogs/body-system-webinars/urinary-system-function) titled “Urinary System Function,” Dr. Morse discusses the importance of the urinary system and suggests that many health issues are tied to its dysfunction. He recommends various herbs and detoxification methods as solutions. A quote from the article reads, “In this article, we will take a closer look at the urinary system’s anatomy and physiology and meet some of the herbs in Dr. Morse’s formulas that best support this system.” While the urinary system is crucial for health, the broad claims made in the post lack empirical support from the wider medical community.
Another significant aspect of Dr. Morse’s platforms is their
[medical disclaimer](https://drmorsesdetoxcenters.com/services/). The disclaimer explicitly states that its content is “solely for educational purposes” and clarifies it does “not involve diagnosing treatment, or prescribing of remedies for diseases.” This disclaimer highlights the platform’s acknowledgment of its non-medical stance. Despite this, the platform sells supplements and offers guidance on health matters. Their [FAQ](https://drmorsesdetoxcenters.com/faq/) section indicates that while they don’t “treat,” they teach individuals how to address their health issues, suggesting a thin line between education and medical advice.
Furthermore, Dr. Morse’s association with platforms like the
[International School of the Healing Arts](https://internationalschoolofthehealingarts.com/) and courses on [spiritual insights](https://courses.internationalschoolofthehealingarts.com/spiritual-insights/) blend [spiritual teachings](https://courses.internationalschoolofthehealingarts.com/bio-art-science-of-healing-outline/) with health advice, which may only resonate with some and lack a scientific basis. A quote from the course outline: “Become empowered with DIY strategies for physical healing of body and nervous system, and for strengthening your immune system.”
Dr. Morse has also expressed
[anti-vaccination views](https://drmorse.tv/video/are-you-vaccinated/) such as “ [Nanotechnology Used in Covid Vaccines](https://drmorse.tv/good-read/nanotechnology-used-in-covid-vaccines-2000-foods-goes-unlabeled/),” which is rated as misleading by IFCN fact checker [Reuters Fact Check](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-vaccine-nanoparticles-idUSKBN28F0I9).
