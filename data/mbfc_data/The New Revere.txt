[Founded in 2015](https://thenewrevere.com), New Revere Daily is a conservative news and opinion blog. According to their [about page](https://thenewrevere.com/about-nrdp/) “The New Revere, a project of [The Henry Dearborn Institute for Liberty,](http://henrydearborn.org/) is an all-encompassing, no-holds-barred media platform that delivers news conservatives, libertarians, Republicans, and anyone else who supports the pro-liberty movement (yes, even your liberty loving Democrats hiding from the rest of your party) will love.” The editor-in-chief is Justin Haskins. Mr. Haskins claims the following: “Since 2012, Justin has been published hundreds of times in major digital and print publications, including the [Wall Street Journal,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/), [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), [Townhall.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), and many others. His writing and/or reporting has also been featured by [The Rush Limbaugh Show](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/), Glenn Beck Radio Program, [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and the [Fox News Channel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), as well as by many other outlets and news media personalities.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the New Revere Daily does not often produce original content, but rather republishes right-leaning content from Ben Shapiro and Michelle Malkin, both of whom have poor records with fact-checkers. They also link to right-leaning commentator
[John Stossel](https://thenewrevere.com/2019/06/john-stossel-paid-time-off/). Editorially, Op-Eds come [100% from the right](https://thenewrevere.com/category/top-contributors/). The New Revere also publishes a list of the [top 100 conservative websites](https://thenewrevere.com/tag/top-100-conservative-websites/), some of which fall on our questionable list such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/), and [RedState](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/). In general, the New Revere Daily is mostly factual in their presentation, but far-right in their bias.
