Analysis / Bias
In review, the Liberty Guardian Voice publishes news and opinion favorable to the left. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Rayshard Brooks Shot by APD for Sleeping in Drive-Thru[Video][Update]](https://guardianlv.com/2020/06/rayshard-brooks-shot-by-apd-for-sleeping-in-drive-thruvideo/). This headline is misleading as his sleeping was not the cause of the shooting. The suspect was shot for resisting arrest, taking a taser, and shooting it at an officer, granted while running away and having his back turned. The police shooting was not justified, and hence charges were brought. The point here is the article headline does not fit the story. Most stories on this website are well-sourced and factual but clearly left-biased.
Editorially, the majority of stories favor a liberal perspective, such as this
[The Cowardly Actions of a Bully Malignant Narcissist (Trump).](https://guardianlv.com/2022/12/the-cowardly-actions-of-a-bully-malignant-narcissist/) Generally, most information is fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
