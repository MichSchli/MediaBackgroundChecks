Analysis / Bias
The ideological positions of Workers World consist primarily of workers’ struggles, anti-racism, and anti-discrimination. There is moderate to heavy use of loaded emotional words in both headlines and articles that favor the far left and socialist/communist viewpoints, such as this
[Workers Assembly Against Racism: Union rights, cancel rent!](https://www.workers.org/2021/08/58666/). All articles reviewed favored the left over the right. Workers World tends to source their information; however, sometimes they used far-left sources that have not always been factual in the past.
Under the editorial section, they publish opinion pieces that align with Marxist-Leninist beliefs such as this
[Housing is a right!](https://www.workers.org/2021/08/58137/) In general, all information published strongly favors the progressive-socialist-communist left through rejection of racism, concern for climate change, strong unionization, redistribution of wealth, and equity under the law.
