Analysis / Bias
Borgen Magazine is part of the Borgen Project; therefore, typically, they provide articles written by the Borgen Project, such as “
[American Politicians Who Have Battled Global Poverty.”](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/politicians-who-have-battled-global-poverty/) It highlights the efforts of five politicians who have worked to reduce poverty worldwide. The politicians they mention are George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, John McCain, and Bill Clinton. The article sources information from credible sources such as [bushcenter.org](https://www.bushcenter.org), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Global Citizen](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-citizen/), and [Vote Smart.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/votesmart/)
The magazine, which is part of The Borgen Project, leans towards a left-center bias as it focuses on left-leaning advocacy positions and relies on credible sourcing from official government websites and reputable sources such as senate.gov,
[congress.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/congress-gov/), and read.oecd-ilibrary.org. The article [“The READ Act Reauthorization Act of 2023”](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/read-act-reauthorization-act/) emphasizes the severity of the worldwide education crisis and the need for legislative action to address it, particularly for vulnerable populations and girls. It is written in a balanced tone, holds left-leaning advocacy positions, and is fact-based in reporting.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years
Overall, based on their selection of left-leaning stories, we rate Borgen Magazine as left-center biased. We also rate them high for factual reporting due to their use of credible sourcing and a clean fact-check record. (M. Huitsing 06/06/2023) Updated (03/01/2024)
