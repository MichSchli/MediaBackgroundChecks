History
Founded in 2013 by Adrian Garcia, The Gaily Grind is a website covering news and commentary for the LGBTQ community. According to their
[about page](https://thegailygrind.com/about/), “The Gaily Grind is an online LGBTQ news magazine, reporting on the latest national and world news as well as the latest in entertainment and topics of great importance within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.”
The website lacks transparency as it does not disclose ownership or its liberal perspective.
