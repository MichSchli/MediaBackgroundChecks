Analysis / Bias
In review, The Washington Sentinel does not produce original content but rather summarizes news stories and offers right biased opinions. An example is this article
[Schiff’s ‘Parody’ Conversation During DNI Hearing Prompts Motion to Censure](https://thewashingtonsentinel.com/schiffs-parody-conversation-during-dni-hearing-prompts-motion-to-censure/). This story is sourced from the questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), which has failed numerous fact checks. Some other sources used are the factually Mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) as well as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). In general, story selection on the Washington Sentinel always favors the right. It denigrates the left while sometimes using poor sources to validate their claims and the outright publishing of fake news.
