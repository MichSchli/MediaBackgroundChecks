History
Founded in 1995, The Vaccine Reaction promotes anti-vaccination propaganda. According to the
[about page](https://thevaccinereaction.org/about-us/), “The Vaccine Reaction, or TVR, is a free online subscription journal newspaper published by the [National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-vaccine-information-center-nvic/), a 501(c)(3)H nonprofit organization. We do not accept advertising. Mercola.com hosts our website”. [Mercola.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) is an organization that promotes medical quackery, pseudoscience, and misinformation.
Funded by / Ownership
Individual donations and philanthropic foundations fund NVIC. NVIC claims to be preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education. Revenue for the website is through donations to NVIC.
Analysis / Bias
The Vaccine Reaction’s editorial point of view is anti-vaccination. Linked references for their “articles” point back to their site. Thus, their sourcing is inadequate if not non-existent. For example, “
[thevaccinereaction.org/2021/03/severe-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-close-schools-in-michigan-ohio-and-new-york](http://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/03/severe-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-close-schools-in-michigan-ohio-and-new-york).” Another example includes “Courts in Spain Order Forced COVID-19 Vaccination of Incapacitated Nursing Home Residents,” which links back to their site and offers innuendo without evidence of their being a problem with the COVID vaccine.
Opinion pieces use questionable sources such as the “The Biggest COVID-19 Vaccine Skeptics? Frontline Health Care Workers”, published by
[The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/). The Vaccine Reaction frequently promotes debunked science such as [vaccines causing autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/), cancer, and numerous other misleading ailments. See fact checks below. In general, they promote medical quackery related to vaccines and offer zero credibility.
