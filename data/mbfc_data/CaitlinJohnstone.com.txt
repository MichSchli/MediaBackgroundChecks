Analysis / Bias
Caitlin Johnstone’s website offers societal and political content, including articles and poetry. In our analysis, we examined several articles: First, an article titled
[“On War With China, Australia Is Caught Between A Rock And A Pentagon”](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2023/03/14/on-war-with-china-australia-is-caught-between-a-rock-and-a-pentagon/) critiques Australia’s military ties with the U.S. using emotionally loaded language such as phrases like “relentless onslaught of war–with–China propaganda,” “incredibly brazen admission,” and “unimaginably terrible war.”
While the article cites multiple sources, its tone and framing could be interpreted as conspiratorial, particularly regarding the U.S.’s influence on Australian foreign policy. The author relies on mainstream outlets like
[ABC Radio National](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news-australia/), [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), and [Defense News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/defense-news/), and less transparent ones like the YouTube channel [“Tales of the American Empire.”](https://www.youtube.com/@talesoftheamericanempire/about)
In addition, John J. Mearsheimer, a cited expert, is reputable but
[controversial](https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2022/03/john-mearsheimer-dark-origins-realism-russia) in international relations. He is known for his “offensive realism” theory and has faced criticism for his views, such as his opposition to NATO expansion and his book “The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy.” Lastly, Caitlin Johnstone also cites her Substack page, which may be seen as less objective.
Next, in the article
[“The USA’s Covert Empire: Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix,”](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2023/06/17/the-usas-covert-empire-notes-from-the-edge-of-the-narrative-matrix/) Johnstone criticizes U.S. foreign policy. Her focus is squarely on the U.S.’s “covert empire” and its influence on other nations, which presents a one-sided view of global politics by critiquing the actions of the U.S. without offering a comparative analysis of other influential nations like [Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) or [China](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/). She cites sources including [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), an archived article from [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/), and [New York Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-magazine/#google_vignette).
In the last article we analyzed, titled
[My Sources Corroborate Sy Hersh’s Nord Stream Report: Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2023/02/10/my-sources-corroborate-sy-hershs-nord-stream-report-notes-from-the-edge-of-the-narrative-matrix/), Johnstone theorizes that the US Government is behind the pipeline bombing. She states her sources are “logic, common sense, and public statements by US government officials.” As of this date, [no concrete evidence](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/03/08/who-blew-up-the-nord-stream-pipelines) indicates who bombed the pipeline. While it could be true that the USA blew up the pipeline, it could also be true that Russia, [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/), or another foreign actor did.
Generally, Caitlin Johnstone’s website can be characterized as leaning left, particularly in its critical stance toward U.S. foreign and military policy. The site predominantly scrutinizes the U.S. while sparing similar critiques of other global powers, indicating a specific ideological viewpoint.
