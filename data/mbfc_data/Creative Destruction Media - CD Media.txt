Analysis / Bias
CD Media primarily republishes or summarizes articles from questionable sources like
[Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2017/12/13/steve-bannon-breitbart-tried-take-twitter/). They also republish [Steve Bannon’s War Room](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/war-room-steve-bannon-bias/) podcast, which frequently advances conservative conspiracy theories. Articles and headlines often contain emotional language that favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this [Catastrophic Contagion – Bill Gates, WHO, And Johns Hopkins Conduct Another Pandemic Simulation](https://creativedestructionmedia.com/news/2022/12/12/catastrophic-contagion-bill-gates-who-and-johns-hopkins-conduct-another-pandemic-simulation/). This story, like many others, does not offer a hyperlinked source.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and particularly former President Trump, such as this
[Trump HAS To Talk About How He Will Defeat The Election Fraud Cabal – No More Hopium!](https://creativedestructionmedia.com/opinion/2022/11/16/trump-has-to-talk-about-how-he-will-defeat-the-election-fraud-cabal-no-more-hopium/) Based on their support for Trump, they have endorsed his lies regarding election fraud, such as this [Video: Will Republicans Stop the 2022 Election Fraud?](https://creativedestructionmedia.com/opinion/2022/08/02/video-will-republicans-stop-the-2022-election-fraud/) There is [no evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) of significant election fraud in the 2020 or 2022 elections.
CD Media also promotes Covid-19 disinformation, such as this
[Ed Dowd: The Vaccine Deaths Are Massive](https://creativedestructionmedia.com/video/2022/11/17/ed-dowd-the-vaccine-deaths-are-massive/). There is [no evidence](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaers-12000-idUSL1N2P21DB) to support “Massive” vaccine deaths. Finally, Cd Media promotes various globalist conspiracies and false flags regarding mass shootings like this [Facts Beg The Question – Was Uvalde School Shooting Manufactured To Take Your Guns?](https://archive.ph/LhpRS#selection-26575.0-26575.84) In general, this website promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
