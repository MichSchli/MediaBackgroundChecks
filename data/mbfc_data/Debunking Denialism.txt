Analysis / Bias
In review, Debunking Denialism reports news that refutes pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and junk science in general. The website features many articles exposing
[anti-vaxxers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), such as this: [Fake Anti-Vaccine “Fact-Checker” Targets Memorial Page of Dead Child](https://debunkingdenialism.com/2019/03/03/fake-anti-vaccine-fact-checker-targets-memorial-page-dead-child/). This story, like all on this website, is properly sourced. While Debunking Denialism is a pro-science website, it also is political through the use of loaded emotional language such as these [Quacks Who Let Their Son Die Demanded 4 Million Dollars. Court Rejected It](https://debunkingdenialism.com/2019/02/17/quacks-let-son-die-demand-4-million-dollars/), and [No, Science Hasn’t “Always Been a Bit Post-Truth,”](https://debunkingdenialism.com/2017/01/17/no-science-hasnt-always-been-a-bit-post-truth/) and this [Swedish Far-Right Politician Talk Nonsense About Climate Change](https://debunkingdenialism.com/2015/07/25/swedish-far-right-politician-talk-nonsense-about-climate-change/).
When it comes to politics, they have a negative opinion of former
[President Donald Trump](https://debunkingdenialism.com/2017/09/11/trumps-10-worst-anti-science-actions/) and the [far right](https://debunkingdenialism.com/2012/03/08/rejecting-the-holocaust-deniers-quote-mine-of-historian-raul-hilberg/). In general, Debunking Denialism is a pro-science website that leans left based on a belief in [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), evolution, evidence-based medicine, and anti-right sentiments.
