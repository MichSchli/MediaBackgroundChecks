Analysis / Bias
[According to the Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-gop-governors-news-site-20170919-story.html), The Free Telegraph was launched by The Republican Governors Association to promote the virtues of GOP governors while framing Democrats negatively. The Free Telegraph also did not disclose its connection to the Republican Governors Association until [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/f97fbf53c0c84468ae046f861ecf3b64/Republican-governors-get-into-the-%27news%27-business) inquired about it and claimed that critics had called it a propaganda site. In addition, according to the [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), a former Ted Cruz campaign spokesman told the AP that “ [It’s propaganda for sure, even if they have objective standards and all the reporting is 100 percent accurate.”](https://apnews.com/f97fbf53c0c84468ae046f861ecf3b64/Republican-governors-get-into-the-%27news%27-business)
In review, both headlines and articles contain loaded words such as:
[“Michael Moore Makes A Fool of Himself (Again).”](https://freetelegraph.com/michael-moore-makes-fool-himself-again/) All stories favor the right, in particular the work of Republican Governors. Although The Free Telegraph uses proper sources, information is spun in such a way as to promote propaganda for the Republican Governors and against Democrats. The Free Telegraph has also been flagged by the Web of Trust as being [suspicious](https://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/freetelegraph.com?utm_source=addon&utm_content=popup).
