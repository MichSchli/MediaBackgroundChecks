Analysis / Bias
In review, the Other 98% have an extreme left-wing bias through story selection and political affiliation that favors the left. There is significant use of loaded language such as this:
[If you want Trump to deport DACA kids, you’re not a patriotic Christian, you’re an asshole.](https://other98.com/want-trump-deport-daca-kids-youre-not-patriotic-christian-youre-asshole/) There is very little hyperlinking when it comes to sourcing information; therefore, it is difficult to determine the credibility and if their reporting is factual. In short, this is a propaganda source that tends to mislead, primarily via social media through the sharing of inaccurate memes.
