History
Big League Politics is an Alt-Right news and opinion blog founded by Patrick Howley, a former writer for the far-right
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). According to their about page, “Big League Politics is a fast-paced news site led by a team of top-level investigative reporters, filmmakers, and citizen journalists all over the country. We challenge powerful politicians in both the Republican and Democratic Parties. We are not conservative. We are not liberal. We are road warriors fighting the good fight for journalism.” They further state that “All stories on Big League Politics are factually accurate.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In reviewing articles on the Big League Politics website, it is clear that the sole mission is to promote the agenda of President Trump. Essentially, this could be classified as a propaganda media arm for the President. While there are excellent examples of well-sourced journalism on this website, there are also unproven conspiracy-type stories. For instance, in one article, the author claims that Obama officials hacked justice John Roberts as evidence of a Deep State conspiracy. The source of this audio is from
[two discredited public figures](https://www.mediamatters.org/stories-and-interests/fake-news). In other stories, conspiracy theorists are used as sources of information. [In this story](http://bigleaguepolitics.com/roger-stone-seth-rich-partied-imran-awan-night-death/), they rely on [Infowars’ Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and fellow conspiracy theorist [Roger Stone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stone-cold-truth/) for information and opinion.
Overall, the blog is well written but with a strong right-wing bias in story selection. Many stories are factual or at the very least rooted in fact, but there are many stories that are unproven, with conclusions being drawn by the authors. These stories are propaganda at best and conspiracy theories at worst. Finally, during the 2020 elections, they have promoted false information. See failed fact checks below.
