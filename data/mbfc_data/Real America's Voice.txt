Analysis / Bias
The Real America’s Voice website streams their live programming, consisting of conservative news reporting and news talk shows. Feature shows include Steve Bannon’s
[War Room Pandemic](https://americasvoice.news/playlists/the-war-room/), which publishes misleading information regarding the Coronavirus. In fact, Bannon was [banned from Twitter and Youtube](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/steve-bannons-show-pulled-off-twitter-and-youtube-over-calls-for-violence/) after claiming he would like to see Dr. Anthony Fauci’s head on a pike. Apparently, this type of language is acceptable at Real America’s Voice.
Another featured show is Just the News AM, which provides news coverage from the right biased and factually mixed
[Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/). Finally, they also feature a show called Securing America by Frank Gaffney. Mr. Gaffney is an [anti-immigration advocate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-security-policy/) who is considered a [purveyor of hate](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/frank-gaffney-jr) based on Islamophobia. The website features numerous other right-wing hosts, but these are the most known names.
Real America’s Voice republishes news from two primary sources, Just the News and
[Voice of America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/voice-of-america/). While Voice of America is considered a low-biased source, Just the News is strongly right biased and promotes misinformation and conspiracy theories. In general, RAV holds a strong right conservative editorial bias and does not always report factually based on numerous failed fact checks by their hosts.
