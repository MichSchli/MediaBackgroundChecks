Analysis / Bias
In review, The Campaign Life Coalition promotes news and information primarily aimed at a pro-life audience. They provide information on alternatives to abortion and
[explicit photos](https://www.campaignlifecoalition.com/abortion-photos) to discourage abortion. They provide a blog that frequently promotes a pro-life agenda such as [THIS US ELECTION MUST BE ABOUT ABORTION](https://www.campaignlifecoalition.com/clc-blog/id/114/title/this-us-election-is-about-abortion). This article is unsourced.
Editorially, they support conservatives such as
[Derrick Sloan in 2020](https://twitter.com/CampaignLife/status/1220096631003058176?s=20), who opposes abortion. They generally report news in a one-issue conservative fashion and without credible sourcing.
