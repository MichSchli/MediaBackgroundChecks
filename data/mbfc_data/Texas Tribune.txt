Analysis / Bias
In review, The Texas Tribune primarily covers Texas news through the use of journalists. Typically, there is minimal use of loaded language such as this:
[Texas raises the legal smoking age, exempting members of the military](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/20/texas-raised-legal-smoking-age/). This story is properly sourced via hyperlinks. When it comes to politics, The Texas Tribune often reports negatively on [President Trump](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/05/donald-trump-campaign-el-paso-shooting/) as well as other [Republicans in Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/07/25/chip-roy-ted-cruz-conservative-us-house/). They also frequently report on immigration and the border wall, with most articles favoring [liberal policy](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/05/28/el-paso-area-privately-built-border-wall-receives-cease-and-desist-let/). Lastly, the Texas Tribune favors the consensus on [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and all other scientific matters regarding sciences.
