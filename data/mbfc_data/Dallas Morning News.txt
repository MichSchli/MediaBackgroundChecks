Editorially, the Dallas Morning News
[always endorses Republican candidates](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2016/09/for-the-first-time-since-1964-the-dallas-morning-news-wont-endorse-a-republican-presidential-candidate/); however, in 2016, they did not endorse Republican Donald Trump based on the argument that “Donald Trump is not a true Republican.” A review of their opinion page also shows a right-leaning bias in topic selection that favors the right. For example, this paper routinely publishes [negative opinion](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2019/03/16/dumber-bucket-hair-quotes-week) pieces against former Democratic Presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke. In general, the Dallas Morning News publishes straight news with minimal bias and editorially demonstrates a slight right-leaning bias.
