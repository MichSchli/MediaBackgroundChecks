Analysis / Bias
In review, Phys.org is a science, research, and technology news aggregator where much of the content is republished directly from press releases and news agencies in a practice known as
[churnalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism). Most research and stories are presented with low bias and usually straight from the publisher, such as this: [Researchers use light to control high-speed chemical reactions in a new way](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-high-speed-chemical-reactions.html). This research is published directly from the University of Tokyo.
The criticism that Phys.org is a churnalism site is not entirely accurate. They also produce original content such as this:
[Testing quantum mechanics in a non-inertial reference frame using a rotating interferometer](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-mechanics-non-inertial-rotating-interferometer.html). In fact, several articles per day are original Phys.org content. In general, they are a pro-science source with minimal bias.
