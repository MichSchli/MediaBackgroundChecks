Analysis / Bias
Historically, the Junco de la Vega family has been a significant presence in the Mexican press, often maintaining a
[conservative editorial](https://mexico.mom-gmr.org/en/owner/individual-owners/detail/owner/owner/show/junco-de-la-vega-family/) stance. Furthermore, Alejandro Junco de la Vega González has associations with notable figures in Mexico and the U.S., including PAN members Fernando Canales Clariond and Fernando Elizondo and U.S. politician Ted Cruz. These connections have raised questions about Grupo Reforma’s stance towards the left-leaning López Obrador’s administration. [López Obrador](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/newspaper-accuses-intimidation/) has referred to the newspaper as ‘prensa fifi’ and has expressed concerns about its coverage.
As Mexico approaches its 2024 presidential elections with the left-center MORENA party in power, Xóchitl Gálvez stands out with generally
[positive reporting](https://busquedas.gruporeforma.com/reforma/Documento/Web.aspx?id=6409583|ArticulosCMS&url=https://img.gruporeforma.com/imagenes/ElementoRelacionado/11/844/10843214.jpg&text=X%f3chitl+G%e1lvez&tit=). Initially representing the right-of-center PAN in the Senate, she’s now the presidential candidate for the Broad Front for Mexico.
Reforma publishes articles with strong loaded emotional language, such as
[“AMLO is not going to bend me.- Xóchitl”](https://www.reforma.com/amlo-no-me-va-a-doblar-xochitl/ar2653958?v=9) which discusses a judicial decision related to comments about Xóchitl Gálvez, that is also published by [El Norte.](https://www.elnorte.com/amlo-no-me-va-a-doblar-xochitl/ar2653964) The article presents direct quotes from Xóchitl Gálvez without adding subjective or editorialized commentary.
Another article titled “
[Ted Cruz infuriates over gun control question”](https://www.reforma.com/enfurece-ted-cruz-por-pregunta-sobre-control-de-armas/ar2409521) provides a detailed account of an exchange between Senator Ted Cruz and a journalist on the topic of gun control. While the article’s tone appears neutral, the content might be perceived as critical of Cruz’s views on the issue. Regarding sourcing, the article presents direct quotes and hyperlinks provided to a [Sky News UK video.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/) In general, Reforma is fact-based and holds a slight conservative editorial bias.
