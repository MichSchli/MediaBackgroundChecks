History
[Founded in 2012](http://whois.domaintools.com/higherperspectives.com), Higher Perspective is a news and opinion website covering relationships, health, and lifestyle. Their [about page](https://www.higherperspectives.com/st/About) disclaims, “Please be aware, we are not a news website! We are an opinion-based blog about spirituality, health, astrology, and relationships.”
Higher Perspective lacks transparency as it does not name authors, editors, locations, or owners.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Higher Perspective publishes news and information about health, lifestyle, spirituality, and relationships. They rarely publish political content, and when they do, it typically is not biased, such as this:
[7 Brilliant And Hilarious Responses To Donald Trump Winning The Election](https://www.higherperspectives.com/donald-trump-reactions-2087500125.html). Essentially, this is a clickbait website with listicles such as [10 Shocking Facts You Never Knew About North Korea](https://www.higherperspectives.com/shocking-facts-north-korea-2312425603.html). This story does not contain a single hyperlinked source. Higher Perspective also promotes pseudoscience such as [astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/) and miracle foods [The Exceptional Benefits of Beetroot That Make It An Almost Miracle Food](https://www.higherperspectives.com/beetroot-2631696732.html). This last story is sourced to the [Healthy Food House](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/healthy-food-house/), which we have rated a quackery level pseudoscience website low in factual reporting.
When it comes to sourcing, they will occasionally use credible sources such as
[WebMD](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/webmd/) and legitimate scientific studies; however, they often utilize poor pseudoscience sources such as [Healthy Holistic Living](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/healthy-holistic-living/). Of note, the website does offer a [disclaimer](https://www.higherperspectives.com/st/Disclaimer) that reads, “We here at Higher Perspective do not hold backgrounds in medicine or science, and anything read on this website should be read with an open mind and taken with a grain of salt.”
