Analysis / Bias
In review, Ghost.Report publishes news with a right-wing bias. Most news stories favor the right while denigrating liberals and their policies. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[CNN & MSM Gets Triggered At POTUS TWEET](https://ghost.report/2017/07/02/cnn-msm-gets-triggered-at-potus-tweet/). Ghost.Report sources their information through a combination of credible media sources and questionable sources such as [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [CNSnews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/).
Ghost.Report also publishes misleading propaganda stories such as this:
[Immigrant Child-Separation Was Obama’s Policy: Handed Kids To Child Traffickers!](https://ghost.report/2018/06/19/immigrant-child-separation-was-obamas-policy-handed-kids-to-child-traffickers/) This story is both misleading and [false](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/19/matt-schlapp/no-donald-trumps-separation-immigrant-families-was/). Finally, during Covid-19, they reported misinformation such as that by [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/) [Watch “The Real Anthony Fauci” the Movie by Robert Kennedy Jr.](https://ghost.report/2022/10/30/watch-the-the-real-anthony-fauci-the-movie-by-robert-kennedy-jr/)
