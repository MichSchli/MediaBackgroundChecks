Analysis / Bias
The Published Reporter primarily focuses on news related to the United States, with a local focus on South Florida, where the website is based. It covers national news with a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording like this
[Progressive Rule Forcing Bailiffs To Unshackle Murder Suspect Allows Him To Escape Court](https://www.publishedreporter.com/2023/03/10/progressive-rule-forcing-bailiffs-to-unshackle-murder-suspect-allows-him-to-escape-court/). This story is sourced from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) and Youtube.
The website also has contributing authors, including
[Roger Stone](https://www.publishedreporter.com/author/rogerstone/), a former adviser to President Trump, and its articles generally support conservative views while harshly criticizing President Biden, such as this [Biden’s Treason Deserves The Firing Squad](https://www.publishedreporter.com/2023/03/21/op-ed-bidens-treason-deserves-the-firing-squad/). Regarding sourcing, we found they use a mix of credible sources like [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) and questionable sources such as [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), [Ben Swann](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-in-media/), and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Editorially, all op-eds favor the right and denigrate the left such as this
[Op-Ed: Deceptive Trans Activists Mislabel “Intersex” Conditions To Fabricate More Than Two Sexes -They’re So Wrong](https://www.publishedreporter.com/2023/04/05/op-ed-deceptive-trans-activists-mislabel-intersex-conditions-to-fabricate-more-than-two-sexes-theyre-so-wrong/) and [Op-Ed: When The Mentally Unstable Lead The Mentally Unstable: Delusional Dems Reintroduce Transgender Bill Of Rights](https://www.publishedreporter.com/2023/04/04/op-ed-when-the-mentally-unstable-lead-the-mentally-unstable-delusional-dems-reintroduce-transgender-bill-of-rights/). [NewsGuard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsguard/), a media watchdog, has [accused](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/publishedreporter.com?cid=f3350030-4bc8-45b2-bcc3-f327bcf0e41f) The Published Reporter of publishing false and unsubstantiated information on various topics, including politics, COVID-19, and climate change.
For example, the website published an article in September 2022 that falsely claimed there was no evidence that human-produced carbon significantly contributes to global warming. However, scientific evidence and reports from various organizations, including NASA, NOAA, and IPCC, suggest that human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels, are the leading contributors to global warming.
The Published Reporter also published a misleading article in August 2022 that claimed that 22 out of 50 pregnant women who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had a miscarriage. This claim was based on a calculation with “numerous mistakes” made by feminist author and former Al Gore consultant Naomi Wolf. The Published Reporter generally holds a far-right conservative bias and does not always report the news accurately.
