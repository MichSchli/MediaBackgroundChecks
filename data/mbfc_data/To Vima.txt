Analysis / Bias
To Vima was known to have a
[center-left](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33344277) stance, however, the new owner businessman Evangelos Marinakisis, according to [an article](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-far-right-is-a-growing-threat-in-greece/) published by [The Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-nation/), is known for “His close friendship and family ties with the Mitsotakis family.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis is the current center-right Prime Minister of Greece and is the son of former Prime Minister [Konstantinos Mitsotakis](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Konstantinos-Mitsotakis).
In review, To Vima uses minimally emotional worded headlines such as
[“What the Turkish ambassador to Athens said about the tripartite Berlin, Hagia Sophia and EEZ”.](https://www.tovima.gr/2020/07/15/politics/o-tourkos-presveytis-stin-athina-gia-trimeri-verolinou-agia-sofia-kai-aoz/) When covering national politics To Vima publishes articles that are critical in tone towards opposition [left-wing](https://apnews.com/847e614d372e4379a1aa44fb7ff114d0) party leader Alexis Tsipras and favorable towards center-right Mitsotakis [“SYRIZA raises the spectre of a New Democracy neo-liberal restoration”](https://www.tovima.gr/2019/06/25/international/syriza-raises-spectre-of-a-new-democracy-neo-liberal-restoration/). A quote from the article reads “As he did in the European Parliament election, Tsipras himself is taking the lead in the campaign for the simple reason that despite all his broken promises and tragic policy errors – especially in the first six months of his first term but also in economic policy.” Another article is favorable to the current Prime Minister [“Mitsotakis calls for unity, personal responsibility, the cooperation of Archbishop to limit COVID-19”](https://www.tovima.gr/2020/03/11/international/mitsotakis-calls-for-unity-personal-responsibility-cooperation-of-archbishop-to-limit-covid-19/). To Vima covers the Trump administration critically [“Editorial: Messages of the US elections.”](https://www.tovima.gr/2018/11/08/international/editorial-messages-of-the-us-elections/)
When it comes to sourcing they utilize sister news websites such as
[In.gr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In.gr) (owned by Alter Ego Media S.A.), however most sourcing consists of quotes without hyperlinking. In general, To Vima holds a right-leaning editorial bias and does not always report news factually.
