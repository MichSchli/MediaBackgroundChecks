Analysis / Bias
In review, The Smoking Gun publishes news stories that are sourced from police reports and legal documents. According to their
[about page](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/about), “Using material obtained from government and law enforcement sources, via Freedom of Information requests, and from court files nationwide, we guarantee everything here is 100% authentic.” The website also features [mugshots](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots) and a database of [bizarre requests](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/backstage) made by celebrities in their contracts.
The news stories use sensational headlines to grab attention, such as this
[More Season’s Beatings From Sunshine State](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/xmas-beatings-case-439027) but always link to evidence. The Smoking Gun primarily publishes information on the more bizarre crimes that are committed, but they do not produce editorial content, and all information is factual and sourced to documents.
