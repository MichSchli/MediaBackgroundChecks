Analysis / Bias
In review, The Harvard Political Review publishes political news and interviews with minimal use of loaded language, such as this
[The Amendment Bigger Than the Constitution](http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/amendment-bigger-than-the-constitution/). This story is well-sourced from credible media outlets such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [New Republic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-republic/), and [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). Another story, [The Myth of Algae Biofuels](http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/the-myth-of-algae-biofuels/), is also very well sourced.
Editorially, the Harvard Political Review features both left and right-leaning authors; however, the majority of stories tend to favor the left, such as this:
[ President Trump’s Iran Policy: The Specter of a Needless War](http://harvardpolitics.com/world/iran-war/). They also frequently interview left-leaning personalities such as [Preet Bahara](http://harvardpolitics.com/interviews/truth-in-trumps-impeachment-interview-with-preet-bharara/) and [Don Lemon](http://harvardpolitics.com/interviews/interview-with-don-lemon/). In general, the Harvard Political Review reports factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
