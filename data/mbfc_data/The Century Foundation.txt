Analysis / Bias
In review, The Century Foundation advocates for “progressive ideas that benefit the public good.” They achieve this through research such as this
[How Minneapolis Ended Single-Family Zoning](https://tcf.org/content/report/minneapolis-ended-single-family-zoning/). This research consists of over 100 citations from credible sources. The website also features a section called publications that sometimes uses emotional wording such as this: [Attacking the Black–White Opportunity Gap That Comes from Residential Segregation](https://tcf.org/content/report/attacking-black-white-opportunity-gap-comes-residential-segregation/). This story is also very well sourced.
Editorially, The Century Foundation aligns with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, supporting income equality, fighting climate change, race and inequality and promotion of unions. When reporting on President Trump, they do not have a favorable opinion such as this:
[Trump’s First Year Unsettles World Politics](https://tcf.org/content/report/trump-first-year-unsettles-world-politics/). In general, all content is factual with a Progressive Left editorial bias.
