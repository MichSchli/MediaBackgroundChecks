Analysis / Bias
In review, The Orange County Register reports local news through reporters with minimal bias such as this
[14,000 people have been tested for coronavirus in Orange County as of April 13](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/04/13/14000-people-have-been-tested-for-coronavirus-in-orange-county-as-of-april-13/). National and international news is provided by multiple sources that are factually accurate.
Editorially, the OC Register has not endorsed a presidential candidate since the last century. However, on the
[local level](https://ballotpedia.org/The_Orange_County_Register), they tend to endorse libertarian/conservative-leaning politicians. A review of op-eds indicates a reasonable balance, but more favor the right such as this [Faulconer looks like the main GOP hope for a breakthrough](https://www.ocregister.com/2021/02/15/faulconer-looks-like-the-main-gop-hope-for-a-breakthrough/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
