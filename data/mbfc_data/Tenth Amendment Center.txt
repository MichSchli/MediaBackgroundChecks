History
Founded in 2007 by
[Michael Boldin](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/michael-boldin/), the Tenth Amendment Center is an organization/website based on the Tenther Movement. [The Tenther Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenther_movement) is a social movement in the United States in which the adherents espouse the political ideology that the federal government’s powers must be read very narrowly to exclude much of what the federal government already does, citing the [Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) in support of this. The amendment states: “powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
Interestingly, Michael Boldin fully disclaims how the Southern Poverty Law Center has characterized him with this quote: According to the SPLC’s profile page on him, Michael “is an ideologue who has spent years promoting the idea that states can “nullify” federal legislation they don’t like — the very same argument pushed by defenders of slavery and segregation.”
Put simply; the Tenth Amendment Center believes states’ rights outweigh federal laws.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Tenth Amendment Center’s website provides constitutional information through news articles, videos, and an educational section called Constitution 101. News articles typically contain moderate loaded emotional language that favors the right such as this:
[Is the U.S. Government the Enemy of the People?](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2019/09/11/is-the-u-s-government-the-enemy-of-the-people/) This opinion piece regarding Government Surveillance is very well sourced to Justice.gov, [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). In another story, there is again strong use of emotional language such as this: [How Government Goons Use Civil Asset Forfeiture to Rob Us Blind](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2017/03/29/how-government-goons-use-civil-asset-forfeiture-to-rob-us-blind/). This opinion piece is also well-sourced from such outlets as the [Chicago Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/chicago-tribune/), WaPo, and [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/).
Under the Constitution 101 tab, they provide educational information regarding the Tenth Amendment and clauses that, in their opinion, support states’ rights. One of the primary defenses used by Tenthers is
[Nullification,](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/nullification-overview/) which the Tenth Amendment Center cites frequently. [Nullification](https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2558&context=lawreview) is a legal theory that a state has the right to nullify or invalidate any federal law which that state has deemed unconstitutional with respect to the United States Constitution (as opposed to the state’s own constitution). The theory of nullification has never been legally upheld by federal courts. While this may sound similar to Libertarianism, it is not. For example, a Libertarian is opposed to federal and state restrictions on such things as drug use, whereas a Tenther would only be concerned with restrictions placed by the Federal Government and not the state. Therefore, they would be fine if the state imposed this restriction.
Editorially, the Tenth Amendment Center is frequently critical of
[Socialism](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2011/03/05/are-all-governments-socialist/) as well as [Conservatism](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2013/01/22/the-myth-of-the-conservative-supreme-court/). In other words, the modern conservative is not far enough right.
The Tenth Amendment Center has
[received criticism](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/michael-boldin) from the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) due to its anti-Government ideology, which historically has been used as an argument to support segregation and slavery. The left-leaning [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/return-of-the-confederacy) has [said of the Tenther movement](https://www.thedailybeast.com/return-of-the-confederacy), “They hate Lincoln, the New Deal, and desegregation. They love Jefferson Davis, secession, and nullification.”
