Analysis / Bias
In review, I, Hypocrite uses loaded words frequently in headlines and articles. For example, on their about page, they refer to feminism as a “Narcissistic Mental Disorder.” All articles favor the right and use terms such as “
[snowflake](http://ihypocrite.net/2016/07/21/special-snowflake-has-meltdown-after-dad-tightens-purse-strings/)” to describe those with liberal viewpoints. In another article, they use the racist symbol [Pepe the Frog](http://ihypocrite.net/2017/07/03/gender-blindness-favors-men-again/) for no apparent reason other than to declare their position on race and gender equality.
