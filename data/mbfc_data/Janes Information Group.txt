Analysis / Bias
In review, Janes.com publishes news and information from all of their magazines primarily covering military and conflict-related issues. Articles and headlines do not use loaded wording such as this
[Korean MRO specialist launches Sacheon facility](https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/korean-mro-specialist-launches-sacheon-facility_13830) and this [South Korea to begin series-production of locally developed KTSSM tactical missile system](https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/south-korea-to-begin-series-production-of-locally-developed-ktssm-tactical-missile-system). The website also provides in-depth case studies focused on global military issues such as this [Threat Assessment: South China Sea](https://www.janes.com/military-threat-intelligence/military-capabilities/south-china-sea-threat-analysis-case-study). Case Studies are well-sourced and in-depth. In general, Janes is a low-biased and high factual source.
