Analysis / Bias
In review, Issues is a forum for discussing public policy related to science, technology, engineering, and medicine. There is the occasional use of loaded emotional wording in articles, such as this book review on climate change:
[Catastrophic Myopia.](https://issues.org/catastrophic-myopia/) Regarding climate change, Issues hold pro-science positions that human-influenced climate change is a threat.
The website also offers a section for news, current events, and trends such as this:
[Clear Talk Needed on New Coronavirus](https://issues.org/news/clear-talk-needed-on-new-coronavirus/) and this [EPA Reducing Waterway Protection](https://issues.org/news/epa-reducing-waterway-protection/). Both of these news stories are appropriately sourced.
Editorially, Issues in Science and Technology covers politics as it relates to science and technology and with minimal bias, such as this:
[Trump v. Reagan: Who Proposed Largest Cuts in Research Spending?](https://issues.org/news/trump-v-reagan-who-proposed-largest-cuts-in-research-spending/) Although they take left-leaning positions on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and conservation, they always promote pro-science information and are consistently factual.
