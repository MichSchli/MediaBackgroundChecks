Analysis / Bias
In review, The Courier-Tribune covers local news, crime, sports, and weather for the Asheboro, North Carolina area. Local news is reported through journalists with minimal bias:
[19 charged in Alamance County prostitution sting](https://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20200204/19-charged-in-alamance-county-prostitution-sting). National and world news is provided by USA Today and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). The website also features a section called “Elections” that reports political news such as this: [Polls: Americans dissatisfied with state of the union](https://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20200201/polls-americans-dissatisfied-with-state-of-union). This story is derived from the Associated Press.
Editorially, we could not find evidence for whom the paper has endorsed in previous Presidential elections. A review of editorials shows a reasonable balance of opinion with slightly more favoring the right:
[Warren’s big bad idea: Taxing our way to prosperity](https://www.courier-tribune.com/opinion/20191213/warrens-big-bad-idea-taxing-our-way-to-prosperity). In general, news reporting is low biased and factual, while editorials very slightly favor the right, but not enough to move this paper from the Least Biased category.
