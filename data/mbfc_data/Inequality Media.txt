Analysis / Bias
In review, Inequality Media’s videos feature Reich discussing topics relating to inequality and power primarily in the United States, including universal basic income, the racial wealth gap, affordable housing, and gerrymandering. For example, in this recent video titled

In general, the content on Inequality Media is left-biased, favoring a Democratic Socialist perspective on economics.
