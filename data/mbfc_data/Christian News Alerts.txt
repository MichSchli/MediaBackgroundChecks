Analysis / Bias
In review, Christian News Alerts does not publish original news stories but summarizes news from other sources and interjects conservative-leaning opinions. Headlines are often highly sensationalized and emotional in favor of the right, such as this:
[Ex-Abortionist Shows Sick Trick They Used to Get Teen Moms to Abort – ‘You Grab the Bony Part of Their Elbow](https://www.christiannewsalerts.com/ex-abortionist-shows-sick-trick-they-used-to-get-teen-moms-to-abort-you-grab-the-bony-part-of-their-elbow/).’
In general, Christian News Alerts is right-biased in story selection and uses poor sources.
