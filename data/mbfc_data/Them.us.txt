Analysis / Bias
In review, Them.us publishes original content covering news and information from an LGBTQ perspective. Many stories involve fashion and celebrity news, while occasionally, some cover politics. Headlines often contain only moderate to minimally loaded wording such as this:
[When the Club Kids Ruled New York](https://www.them.us/story/new-york-club-kids-walt-cassidy). Political news also features moderate wording and typically favors the left, such as this: [Why This Year’s Pride Marches Should Really Be Demonstrations Against ICE](https://www.them.us/story/pride-ice-demonstrations). This story is properly sourced to [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) and the [ACLU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-civil-liberties-union-aclu/).
Editorially, Them.us does not have a favorable view of former President Donald Trump:
[Behind the Trump Administration’s Hypocritical Push to Decriminalize Homosexuality](https://www.them.us/story/trump-administration-decriminalize-homosexuality). In general, they report news factually through proper sourcing of information with a left-leaning political bias.
