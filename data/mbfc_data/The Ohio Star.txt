History
Founded in 2018, The Ohio Star is a news and opinion website with a right-leaning bias in reporting. According to their
[about page](https://theohiostar.com/about-us/), “We feature articles reporting news, politics, and policy at the state level, primarily from Ohio. We round out our daily coverage with national stories and thoughtful commentary of interest to our readers.” According to an investigation by [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/03/04/activists-setup-local-news-sites/), The Ohio Star is not a local newspaper but rather a front for “Tea Party-connected conservative activists: Michael Patrick Leahy and Christina Botteri.” Snopes details connections to conservative donors and PACS as well.

Funded by / Ownership
The Ohio Star is a “Delaware-registered
[company](http://archive.fo/RhSMq), Star News Digital Media, Inc., whose [explicit strategy](https://archive.fo/RhSMq) is to target battleground states with conservative news.” Under this company are the Tennessee Star, Michigan Star, Battlegroundstatenews.com, and [Minnesota Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/minnesota-sun/), essentially duplicating the original Tennessee Star. Advertising generates revenue; however, Snopes goes in-depth on how they are [funded](https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/03/04/activists-setup-local-news-sites/).
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Ohio Star reports news and publishes commentary with a right-wing bias in story selection. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[Commentary: Paul Ryan’s Legacy is the Destruction Of American Sovereignty](http://theohiostar.com/2018/12/08/commentary-paul-ryans-legacy-is-the-destruction-of-american-sovereignty/). In this piece, there isn’t any sourcing outside of a quote. In [another story](http://theohiostar.com/2018/10/29/study-cites-cleveland-ohio-case-of-food-stamp-millionaire-pascal-mahvi-shows-how-tax-dollars-leave-america-and-fund-terrorism-around-the-world/) we also see a quote serving as a source, but nothing hyperlinked to actual data. The Ohio Star also republishes news from the factually Mixed, right-biased [Daily Caller,](http://theohiostar.com/2018/10/29/study-cites-cleveland-ohio-case-of-food-stamp-millionaire-pascal-mahvi-shows-how-tax-dollars-leave-america-and-fund-terrorism-around-the-world/) which allows republishing via Creative Commons.
Although The Ohio Star is right-biased and generally factual, we cannot rate them High for factual reporting due to the source being exposed as a political activism website attempting to look like a local paper. For this reason, we rate them factually Mixed based on a lack of transparency and the promotion of propaganda.
