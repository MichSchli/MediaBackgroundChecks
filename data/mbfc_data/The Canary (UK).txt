Analysis / Bias
In review, The Canary publishes political news with the use of strong loaded language in headlines such as this:
[Media elites say Venezuela proves socialism doesn’t work. But their argument falls flat on its face](https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2019/01/30/media-elites-say-venezuela-proves-socialism-doesnt-work-but-their-argument-falls-flat-on-its-face/), and this [Theresa May’s latest Brexit plan is so ludicrous she might as well promise unicorns sh***ing glitter](https://www.thecanary.co/opinion/2019/01/29/theresa-mays-latest-brexit-plan-is-so-ludicrous-she-might-as-well-promise-unicorns-shing-glitter/). While The Canary does not hide its left-wing bias, they always source its information from credible media outlets such as [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), and [Huffington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/)
Editorially, The Canary favors the progressive left through support for the Labour Party, climate change concerns, income equality, and LGBT rights. The Canary has faced criticism for claiming that Israel is an apartheid state for its occupation of the West Bank. According to the
[Jewish Chronicle](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/canary-editor-mendoza-suspended-from-twitter-after-white-supremacist-jlm-post-1.509193), Kerry-Anne Mendoza, the editor-in-chief, had her Twitter account suspended when she compared Jewish Labour Supporters with South Africa’s Apartheid “Imagine if during a day of international solidarity with the oppressed of Apartheid South Africa the Labour leadership opted instead to spend the day with white supremacists. That’s what Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner are doing today.”
Ms. Mendoza had her account reinstated with a Twitter spokesperson stating: “The account referenced was mistakenly suspended and has now been reinstated.” The website also faced criticism for employing a writer that had previously written what the Jewish Chronicled called
[“Antisemitic tropes”.](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk/canary-journalist-who-shared-antisemitic-tropes-is-linked-to-russian-propaganda-news-site-1.506121) The author Steve Topple later apologized for his words. It should be noted that the Jewish Chronicle is a right-wing publication that strongly supports Israel and is anti-labor. In fact, they have faced lawsuits for libel and have lost on several occasions for [claiming](https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/jewish-chronicle-pays-damages-over-claims-councillor-invited-anti-semitic-activist-to-event/) individuals are antisemitic. In general, the news reported is mostly factual with a very strong left-leaning bias, especially in support of Palestine, which some right-leaning sources have claimed is antisemitic.
