Analysis / Bias
In review, True Viral News publishes news stories from other sources, often without sourcing and directly plagiarizing stories. For example, this story,
[Survey finds fecal matter on every McDonald’s touchscreen it tested](https://trueviralnews.com/survey-finds-fecal-matter-on-every-mcdonalds-touchscreen-it-tested/) is literally copied and pasted from this article by a [Roanoke, Virginia TV News website.](https://www.wdbj7.com/content/news/Survey-finds-fecal-matter-on-every-McDonalds-touchscreen-it-tested-507662241.html) In another story, [Ohio pastor encouraged other ministers to have sex with teen who was ‘groomed,’ prosecutors say](https://trueviralnews.com/ohio-pastor-encouraged-other-ministers-to-have-sex-with-teen-who-was-groomed-prosecutors-say/) is [plagiarized verbatim](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ohio-pastor-encouraged-other-ministers-have-sex-groomed-teen-prosecutors-n987186) from [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), without giving credit. This pattern of blatant plagiarism is the norm throughout the website.
Under their science tag, they plagiarize pseudoscience and conspiracy articles from questionable sources such as
[WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/): [The legendary Chuck Norris pens article urging Americans to wake up on the ‘covert chemtrailing’ taking place in this country](https://trueviralnews.com/the-legendary-chuck-norris-pens-article-urging-americans-to-wake-up-on-the-covert-chemtrailing-taking-place-in-this-country/). They also list the conspiracy website [Prison Planet](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prison-planet/) as a source for a story regarding [chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/). Further, they promote [anti-Vaccine propaganda](https://trueviralnews.com/exposed-vaccine-deep-state-plot-to-seize-naturalnews-com-domain-and-criminalize-all-speech-that-questions-vaccine-propaganda/) from the discredited conspiracy website [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/03/26/daily-source-bias-check-natural-news/).
