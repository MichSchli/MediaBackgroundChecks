Analysis / Bias
In Argentina, according to a Nieman Labs
[article](https://www.niemanlab.org/2009/10/how-government-money-can-corrupt-the-press-the-story-from-argentina/) dated 2009, The Argentinian Government funds advertising: “Argentine governments have a long tradition of buying large amounts of advertising in newspapers. And the decisions of where to place ads is left to the government’s whims; in practice, advertising dollars (pesos, actually) are divvied up in ways that curry favor and reward media behavior.”
However,
[RSF.org states](https://rsf.org/en/news/argentinas-media-big-business-few) “Only a small minority of media groups obtains most of its income from traditional content production and publishing. These include Telefé, owned by Viacom, Grupo La Nacion and Grupo Perfil.” The Buenos Aires Times is owned by the Perfil Group and earns most income from content production and not Government funded advertising.
The Buenos Aires Times publishes articles that utilize emotionally loaded headlines:
[“Bullrich: Inflation will hit 70% if Macri doesn’t win re-election”](http://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/bullrich-inflation-will-hit-70-if-macri-doesnt-win-re-election.phtml) and [“Macri plans outreach to Peronism with view to expanding coalition”.](http://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/macri-plans-outreach-to-peronism-with-view-to-expanding-coalition.phtml) [Mauricio Macri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Macri) is the current President of Argentina (center-right). The Buenos Aires Times has a pro-Macri tone; however, they also publish articles criticizing [both sides.](http://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/la-grieta-and-narcissim.phtml)
When it comes to US news, they use neutral headlines,
[“What you need to know: Key takeaways from the Mueller report.”](http://www.batimes.com.ar/section/world/) Further, the Buenos Aires Times [sources their information](http://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/la-grieta-and-narcissim.phtml) from credible sources through quotes such as the [Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) but they primarily source back to themselves.
