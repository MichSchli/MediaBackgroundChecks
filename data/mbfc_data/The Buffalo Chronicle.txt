Analysis / Bias
The Buffalo Chronicle is an online newspaper that focuses on local news in the Buffalo area. They also report news from other locations in New York and Washington D.C. Headlines of articles often contain loaded language that favors the Right such as this:
[Obama’s pathetic ‘Blame Fox’ excuse](https://buffalochronicle.com/2016/12/04/obamas-pathetic-blame-fox-excuse/). This article is essentially a summary of a [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/) article. Further, articles written by staff are right biased and [pro-Trump](https://buffalochronicle.com/2016/04/28/trumping-the-left/). Local news also features strong right-wing bias in attacking local Democrats such as this: [That time Poloncarz appointed ‘patronage hack’ to supervise CPS, following brazen fraud scheme](https://buffalochronicle.com/2019/05/01/that-time-poloncarz-appointed-patronage-hack-to-supervise-cps-following-brazen-fraud-scheme/). In general, The Buffalo Chronicle reports favorably on the right and negatively on the left.
