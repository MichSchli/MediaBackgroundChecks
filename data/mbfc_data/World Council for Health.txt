History
[Founded in 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/worldcouncilforhealth.org), the World Council for Health is a coalition of partners worldwide that promote Covid-19 misinformation and anti-vaccine propaganda. According to their [about page](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/about/#mission), “The World Council for Health brings to the table the world’s best health advocates, doctors, innovators, and activists fighting to achieve good health for all. We work collaboratively with 130+ organizations in 40 countries to advance public health knowledge and sensemaking.” [Read our profile on United Kingdom media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
[EbMCsquared](https://ebmcsquared.org/), a not-for-profit company, owns and manages the World Council for Health. The current CEO is [Dr. Tess Lawrie](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=tess%20lawrie), who frequently promotes covid-19 misinformation. The organization generates revenue through donations. The website discloses its donors, but it requires giving them an email address to view it. Sorry, but I have no interest in providing this group with my email address.
Analysis / Bias
The World Council for Health website publishes news related to their organization and information on Covid-19 and other diseases. Almost all stories reviewed are either based on pseudoscience or false. For example, they promote the dangers of 5G
[World Council for Health General Assembly Meeting on 5G Health Impacts Disrupted](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/2022/03/general-assembly-5g-disrupted/49403/). In this article, they claim that a presentation on the risks of 5G was hacked to prevent their message from being heard. There is [no evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/great-5g-conspiracy/611317/) to support the dangers of 5g.
The majority of articles focus on medical freedom and negative reporting on the
[World Health Organization (WHO)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), where they [claim](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/2022/04/stopthetreaty-comment-who-pandemic-treaty/66422/) “World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed a global pandemic agreement that will give it undemocratic rights over sovereign people.” This statement is false as [‘WHO Has No Authority to Dictate U.S. Health Policy.’](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/scicheck-who-has-no-authority-to-dictate-u-s-health-policy/)
Other articles focus on unproven alternative treatments for Covid-19, such as the use of
[Ivermectin](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/?s=ivermectin&apbct__email_id__search_form=). As of this writing, there is [no consensus evidence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2789362) that Ivermectin is effective in treating Covid-19. Finally, with the increase in Monkeypox cases, they have begun promoting [baseless conspiracy theories](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/2022/05/world-council-for-health-statement-on-monkeypox-cases/75052/) such as this “The World Council for Health notes that non-scientific speculation on recent monkeypox cases by the WHO is being used to justify further human rights violations together with a roll-out of new and experimental smallpox vaccines.” In general, they are right-leaning pseudoscience and health conspiracy website
Failed Fact Checks
- A third party has not fact-checked the World Council of Health; however, the people associated with the website, such as Tess Lawrie, frequently fail fact checks. Further, we provide evidence above that indicates they make false claims.
