Analysis / Bias
In review, The Fiscal Times primarily covers economic and finance news, however, they also report on politics, business, and life. Articles and headlines often do not utilize loaded emotional language such as this
[Democratic Senators Propose $2,000 Monthly Payments Throughout Pandemic](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/05/08/Democratic-Senators-Propose-2000-Monthly-Payments-Throughout-Pandemic). The information in this article is properly sourced to [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) and [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). Story selection is reasonably balanced, but more tend to slightly favor a right-leaning perspective.
Editorially, The Fiscal Times does not report favorably on socialism such as this
[Capitalism vs. Socialism: Why Both Clinton and Sanders Are Wrong](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/15/Capitalism-vs-Socialism-Why-Both-Clinton-and-Sanders-Are-Wrong). However, they also do not endorse Trump with articles such as this: [Worst Unemployment Since the Great Depression.](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/newsletter/20200508-Worst-Unemployment-Great-Depression) In general, the news is reported factually, with more stories slightly favoring the right through the promotion of free-market capitalism.
