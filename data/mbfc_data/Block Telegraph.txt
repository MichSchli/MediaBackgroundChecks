Analysis / Bias
Block Telegraph publishes news and information related to blockchain and cryptocurrency. Articles and headlines are minimally biased in word choices, such as
[What Is the Hype About Trezor Suite and Why Is It so Popular?](https://blocktelegraph.io/trezor-suite-popularity/) Although not labeled promotional, it primarily emphasizes the product’s benefits and lacks critical balance.
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they do report on political issues related to the industry, like
[The ‘Cartelization’ of Wealth by the US Government](https://blocktelegraph.io/the-cartelization-of-wealth-by-the-us-government/) In reviewing dozens, a slight majority of politically related pieces lean slightly left in favoring a liberal perspective. In general, they are fact-based, but the content sometimes blurs the lines by not indicating which stories are promotional.
