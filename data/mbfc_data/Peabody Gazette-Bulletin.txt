Analysis / Bias
The Peabody Gazette-Bulletin focuses on local news reporting and does not publish national news on its website or newspaper. Articles and headlines do not use emotionally loaded language such as this
[Chefâ€™s Plate without Liquor License](http://peabodykansas.com/). However, this story lacks hyperlinking like all others on the website.
Editorially, a review of op-eds indicates a balance of views. In general, the Peabody Gazette-Bulletin is mostly fact-based and exhibits minimal bias in reporting.
