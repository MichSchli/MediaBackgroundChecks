Funded by / Ownership
CleanTechnica is not clear on ownership as they do not easily disclose who owns the website. On their
[invest page](https://cleantechnica.com/invest/), they disclaim they are “privately owned by just three guys”, but do not name these guys. Revenue appears to be derived through clearly disclosed advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, CleanTechnica primarily reports on clean energy and scientific innovation in the field of energy. Articles and headlines typically do not contain loaded emotional language such as this
[From Wet Waste To Flight: Scientists Announce Fast-Track Solution For Net-Zero-Carbon Sustainable Aviation Fuel](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/17/from-wet-waste-to-flight-scientists-announce-fast-track-solution-for-net-zero-carbon-sustainable-aviation-fuel/). Articles are properly sourced to credible media outlets. In general, they are low biased in wording but politically align with the left due to support for clean energy.
