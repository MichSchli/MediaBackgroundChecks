Analysis / Bias
In review, the Eagle-Tribune primarily focuses on local news for Northeastern Massachusetts that is presented with little bias, such as this
[Police: Stolen car ends with suspect’s stabbing](https://www.eagletribune.com/news/merrimack_valley/police-stolen-car-ends-with-suspects-stabbing/article_e50b802d-fcb9-570a-a0f0-d3a4435796fd.html). The newspaper and website do not have a specified section for national news; however, when reporting on national news, they typically rely on the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, there is a reasonable balance between right and left opinions; however, there appears to be slightly more that align with the left. For example, this opinion piece
[Column: Impeding ‘we the people’ from voting](https://www.eagletribune.com/opinion/column-impeding-we-the-people-from-voting/article_1c3710bc-7bd7-56c1-a588-96ec85375a55.html) is critical of Republicans where the author states, “Republicans see their road to recovery in discouraging eligible Americans from voting.” In general, they report the news factually, while editorially, there is a very slight lean left, but still a reasonable balance of opinions.
