Analysis / Bias
Like many other political humor and satire sites, such as
[Wonkette](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wonkette/) on the left, the content on SP is heavily biased and makes little or no pretense at being a serious news source. It is intended as satire only and works well in that regard. The humor is for a conservative audience.
