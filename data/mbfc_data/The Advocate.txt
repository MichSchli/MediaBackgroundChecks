History
[Founded in 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Advocate_(LGBT_magazine)), The Advocate is an American LGBT-interest magazine, printed bi-monthly and available by subscription. The Advocate brand also includes a website. Both the magazine and website have an editorial focus on news, politics, opinion, and arts and entertainment of interest to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender (LGBT) people. The current editor is Zach Stafford. The website provides a [staff page](https://www.advocate.com/staff) but does not offer biographies, lacking transparency.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Advocate reports news related to the LGBT community. Original reporting often uses minimally loaded language:
[Gay Diplomat Nominated as Ambassador to Conservative Lithuania](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/7/23/gay-diplomat-nominated-ambassador-conservative-lithuania). This story, like most, is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as whitehouse.gov, [France24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/), and the [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/). The website offers news under the “Culture” category and Politics. News reported under the politics tab often favors the left: [New Campaign Highlights Major Companies Backing Antigay Politicians](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/7/19/new-campaign-highlights-major-companies-backing-antigay-politicians). Again, this story is correctly sourced to information from the least biased [Open Secrets](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/7/19/new-campaign-highlights-major-companies-backing-antigay-politicians).
Editorially, they offer a Commentary section that features op-eds. Most op-eds again favor the left and are not favorable to former President Donald Trump:
[The Unclean Hands of Donald J. Trump](https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2019/7/18/unclean-hands-donald-j-trump). In general, most stories favor the left through advocacy for progressive liberal policy.
