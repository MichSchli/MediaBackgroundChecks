Analysis / Bias
In review, Feminist Frequency hosts videos and commentary analyzing portrayals of women in popular culture with a current focus on harassment in gaming. Articles and headlines rarely use loaded emotional language, such as this
[Gender Breakdown of Games in 2020](https://feministfrequency.com/2020/10/15/gender-breakdown-of-games-in-2020/). The website also features a list of resources, such as [Feminism 101](https://feministfrequency.com/resources/feminism-101/), which offers definitions and explanations for what feminism is and isn’t. All articles reviewed were properly sourced.
Generally, the content is factual and holds a left-center bias in positions.
