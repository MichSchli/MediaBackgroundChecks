Analysis / Bias
In review, TheLeoTerrell.com publishes
[podcasts](https://theleoterrell.com/podcast/) from Terrell’s Cumulus Media shows and news articles that are written by “Team Terrell.” However, the names of team members are not disclosed. All news stories are written by anonymous “Team Terrell,” and they typically use moderately loaded emotional language that favors the right, such as this: [“Biden Admin Brags About Americans Saving $0.16 On Some July 4th Foods”](https://theleoterrell.com/biden-admin-brags-about-americans-saving-0-16-on-some-july-4th-foods/) and [“Rep. Tlaib Calls For Defunding ICE And Other Border Security Agencies.”](https://theleoterrell.com/rep-tlaib-calls-for-defunding-ice-and-other-border-security-agencies/)
In general, articles are either sourced by quoting such as “Farm Bureau” numbers or hyperlinking to other sources such as Fox News,
[The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Courthouse News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/courthouse-news-service/) Further, they also link to factually mixed sources such as [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) and [“Just The News.”](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/) While story selection on this website always favors the right, they also have published misleading conspiracy stories such as [“Obtained Emails on Election Night Heighten Georgia’s Mysterious Ballot-Counting.”](https://theleoterrell.com/obtained-emails-on-election-night-heighten-georgias-mysterious-ballot-counting/) To date, there is no evidence of fraud or mysterious ballot counting in Georgia.
