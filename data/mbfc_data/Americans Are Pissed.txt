We are one of the leaders of the conservative movement.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Americans are Pissed publishes news stories that frequently praise the right and denigrate the left. Headlines and articles utilize loaded emotional language such as this
[Michael Moore slams ‘disgusting’ DNC for clearing path for Bloomberg: ‘Because he is a billionaire](https://www.americansarepissed.com/post/michael-moore-slams-disgusting-dnc-for-clearing-path-for-bloomberg-because-he-is-a-billionaire). This story is literally copied and pasted from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) without giving credit. This is blatant plagiarism that simply is not legal. In another act of blatant copyright infringement against Fox News, they published this: [DISGRACED NFL rejects veterans group’s Super Bowl ad urging people to stand for the anthem](https://www.americansarepissed.com/post/disgraced-nfl-rejects-veterans-group-s-super-bowl-ad-urging-people-to-stand-for-the-anthem). The only difference between this and the [Fox News version](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/nfl-rejects-veterans-groups-super-bowl-ad-urging-people-to-stand-for-the-anthem), is that Americans are Pissed added the loaded word “Disgraced” to the headline.
After reviewing several more articles we conclude that this site generally does not report original news. In fact, this source frequently violates copyright law through verbatim republishing of news stories from mainstream sources.
Americans are Pissed has not been fact checked because they do not produce original content. Further, we are not sure if Americans are pissed, but we are pretty sure Fox News would be very pissed to find out their work is being stolen and not credited.
