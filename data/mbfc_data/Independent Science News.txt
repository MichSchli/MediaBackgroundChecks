History
[Founded in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioscience_Resource_Project), Independent Science News provides news and critical comment on topics where food, agriculture, and biotechnology impact human health and the environment. Independent Science News is a part of The [Bioscience Resource Project](https://bioscienceresource.org/), a public interest organization that has provided independent research and analysis in agriculture-related biosciences since 2006. Drs founded the Bioscience resource project. Allison Wilson and Jonathan Latham claim to help remedy a perceived deficit of independent scientific research of genetic engineering and its risks. The Bioscience Resource Project (BRP) has been [called](https://www.deniersforhire.com/cranksters/bioscience-resource-project/) a progressive front group posing as an independent outlet for the study of genetic engineering research.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Independent Science News is a food, agriculture, and biotechnology science website that does not support the
[consensus of science](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/05/23/fake-news-nothing-new-6-pseudo-news-websites-colored-gmo-debate-years/) on [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). Recently they published a [misleading article](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/news/gmo-golden-rice-offers-no-nutritional-benefits-says-fda/) regarding the nutritional value of Golden Rice. The report claims, “GMO Golden Rice Offers No Nutritional Benefits Says FDA.” While that may be true based on the amount of rice Americans consume, it is not accurate for developing nations where rice is a staple food. The FDA responded to this [misleading claim](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/06/29/golden-rice-misinformation-fda-debunks-michael-pollan-independent-science-news/) when Marriana Naum wrote the following statement: “It is unfortunate that the statement you reference in our letter responding to BNF 158 has been misconstrued to suggest that there would be no value of the pro-vitamin A in golden rice for its use in the countries where it is intended for distribution.”
Independent Science News also has a news feed that delivers science news from a wide variety of sources. Most of the information comes from credible sources; however, some do not. For example, they use known pseudoscience websites such as
[Sustainable Pulse](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sustainable-pulse/) and gmfreeze.org, to name a few.
