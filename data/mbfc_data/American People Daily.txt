History
[Founded in 2017](https://whois.domaintools.com/americanpeopledaily.com) and based in Florida, American People Daily is an anonymously run hyperpartisan conservative news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://americanpeopledaily.com/about/), “American People Daily will be your conservative news source, reporting only the REAL news not touched by the biased and left-winged mainstream media.”
The website lacks transparency as it does not name editors and authors or disclose ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, American People Daily does not produce original news stories but offers commentary on the news. Articles and headlines often contain highly charged emotional wording that favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this
[Disgusting! White Segregation Under Way in Chicago](https://americanpeopledaily.com/disgusting-white-segregation-under-way-in-chicago/) and this [Kamala’s V.P. Nomination Makes Her the First Place Loser](https://americanpeopledaily.com/kamalas-v-p-nomination-makes-her-the-first-place-loser/).
Further, this source presents opinions with a sycophantic view of former President Trump such as this
[Genius! Trump Finds a Legal Way to Stifle Democratic Votes](https://americanpeopledaily.com/genius-trump-finds-a-legal-way-to-stifle-democratic-voters/). When it comes to sourcing information, there are zero hyperlinks to be found to support claims. None!
Editorially, which is all this website presents, comes from a far-right perspective with many articles opposed to
[immigration](https://americanpeopledaily.com/genius-trump-finds-a-legal-way-to-stifle-democratic-voters/). They also make unsubstantiated claims (no sourcing) such as this “People like Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would love to see illegals have the upper hand when it comes to voting.” In general, this website appears to be the opinions of a single anonymous person who glorifies conservatives and denigrates liberals without evidence to support their claims.
