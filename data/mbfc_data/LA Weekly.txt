Analysis / Bias
In review, LA Weekly features original news reporting on the Los Angeles area and a guide to entertainment, dining, and lifestyle. Although the website does not disclose their political affiliation, virtually all political stories strongly favor the left. There is the frequent use of loaded language that denigrates the right such as this:
[CHRISSIE HYNDE’S PRAISE FOR LIMBAUGH PUTS HER IN MORRISSEY’S SHITTY LEAGUE](https://www.laweekly.com/chrissie-hyndes-praise-for-limbaugh-puts-her-in-morrisseys-shitty-league/) and this [SHITHEAD OF THE AMERICAS: WHAT TRUMP DOESN’T KNOW COULD FILL A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY](https://www.laweekly.com/shithead-of-the-americas-what-trump-doesnt-know-could-fill-a-third-world-country/). This first story is correctly sourced to [The Sunday Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/) and [Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/); however, the second story is not sourced at all.
Editorially, LA Weekly is a liberal publication that frequently supports
[climate change action](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), legal marijuana, and pro-LGBTQ rights such as this: [TIME FOR TEA: STRAIGHT PRIDE IS ABOUT HATE](https://www.laweekly.com/time-for-tea-straight-pride-is-about-hate/). Generally, stories are primarily factual; however, many stories lack proper sourcing.
