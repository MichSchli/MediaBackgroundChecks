History
[Founded in 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Research_Institute), The Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy (PRI) is a California-based free-market think tank that promotes “the principles of individual freedom and personal responsibility” through policies that emphasize a free economy, private initiative, and limited government. The current Chairman is Clark S. Judge. According to their [about page](https://www.pacificresearch.org/mission-statement/) “The mission of the Pacific Research Institute (PRI) is to champion freedom, opportunity, and personal responsibility for all individuals by advancing free-market policy solutions.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Pacific Research Institute does not publish an opinion-based blog but does support right-leaning opinions. For example, under their Worker Freedom category, they have a story named
[“Pending “Buy America” Executive Order Threatens Coronavirus Response.”](https://www.pacificresearch.org/pending-buy-america-executive-order-threatens-coronavirus-response/) This story is properly sourced to [ CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [KHN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kaiser-family-foundation/), and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/).
When it comes to science this source has a mixed record. Some stories minimize climate change by referring to it as “
[Climate Alarmism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/)” such as this article: [With Trump’s Election, America Rejects Job-Killing Climate Change Agenda](https://www.pacificresearch.org/with-trumps-election-america-rejects-job-killing-climate-change-agenda/). PRI is very consistent in that they support [free-market solutions](https://www.pacificresearch.org/?s=climate+change) for climate change. In general, The Pacific Research Institute reports non-scientific news factually, while promoting questions regarding the scientific consensus of human influence on climate change.
