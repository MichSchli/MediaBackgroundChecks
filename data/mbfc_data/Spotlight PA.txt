Analysis / Bias
In review, Spotlight PA publishes investigative journalism for the state of Pennsylvania usually focusing on government issues. News stories reported by Spotlight PA are often published in major Pennsylvania media outlets such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, Pittsburgh Tribune, NPR, and many other smaller local newspapers. Articles and headlines typically do not contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[As thousands of unemployment claims expire, Pa. residents refile, wait on federal benefits](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/03/pa-unemployment-jobs-labor-claims-labor-and-industry/), however, some are moderately emotional such as this [A huge spike in Medicaid enrollment in Pa. shows how devastating the coronavirus has been](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/03/pa-coronavirus-medicaid-enrollment-increase-map/). All stories reviewed were properly sourced.
Editorially, they don’t directly publish op-eds, however, most articles are related to politics. We reviewed numerous articles and found that they investigate both Republicans and Democrats for misdeeds or poor handling of situations. For example, here they are critical of Democratic Governor Tom Wolf
