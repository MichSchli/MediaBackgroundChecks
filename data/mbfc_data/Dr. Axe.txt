Funded by / Ownership

[shop](https://store.draxe.com/?_ga=2.62704620.1108035549.1543628963-895273949.1543628963) that sells or markets products.
Analysis / Bias
The mission of the website appears to be the sale of
[questionable nutrition and natural health-related products](https://store.draxe.com/?_ga=2.55765356.694154162.1509044018-267716437.1509044018), with articles promoting a wide variety of health-related pseudoscience. For example, Dr. Axe promotes [chelation therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation_therapy) as a [treatment for autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-cures/), even though it has been [thoroughly debunked](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/should-we-study-chelation-for-autism/). He also promotes [coffee enemas](https://draxe.com/coffee-enema/) as a means to fight cancer even though they have been shown to be [unsafe](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ask-the-science-based-pharmacist-what-are-the-benefits-of-coffee-enemas/). On this website, you will also find many more articles promoting natural foods and health products that are not scientifically based.
In general, this is a website that promotes dangerous homeopathic remedies for serious conditions that require real medical attention.
