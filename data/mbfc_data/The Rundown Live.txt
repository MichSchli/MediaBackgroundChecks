Analysis / Bias
In review, The Rundown Live does not produce original news articles but provides links to news stories. Some stories are credible such as this from Reuters
[New Mexico congressman tests positive for coronavirus](https://news.trust.org/item/20200801170608-50tlx). Other stories are from poor sources such as [Summit News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/summit-news/).
They also publish misinformation from conspiracy sources such as the Corbett Report:
[How Governments Are Hunting the Infected – #NewWorldNextWeek](https://therundownlive.com/how-governments-are-hunting-the-infected-newworldnextweek/). The website frequently publishes conspiracy theories such as this [World War Three Is Imminent And #INoLongerComply](https://therundownlive.com/world-war-three-is-imminent-and-inolongercomply/) and [ANTIFA SUPPORTS PEDOPHILIA?](https://therundownlive.com/antifa-supports-pedophilia/) In general, this is a tin-foil hat conspiracy website that promotes disinformation.
