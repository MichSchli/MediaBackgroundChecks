The language used in their articles generally contains emotionally loaded language, aligning with their advocacy nature. For instance, the article;
[“Despite #MeToo, Celebrity Justice Remains Massively Unjust”](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2023/jul/1/despite-metoo-celebrity-justice-remains-massively-unjust/) strongly critiques the justice system’s treatment of celebrities, emphasizing the perceived leniency and privileges they enjoy. The language is emotionally loaded, such as “celebrities accused of crimes,” “celebrity privilege,” and “the rich and famous simply aren’t treated like everyone else.” Sources are not hyperlinked in the visible content, but a list is provided further down the article.
