Analysis / Bias
Successful Farming Magazine and the associated website Agriculture.com reports news and information on markets, technology, weather, crops, management, family, and livestock. Articles and headlines utilize minimal loaded emotional language such as this
[U.S. FARMERS LOOK FOR PREMIUM FOR REMAINING 2021 CORN, SOYBEANS](https://www.agriculture.com/markets/newswire/us-farmers-look-for-premium-for-remaining-2021-corn-soybeans), and [THIS FIFTH-GENERATION FARMER HAS A UNIQUE APPROACH TO SOIL HEALTH](https://www.agriculture.com/livestock/cattle/this-fifth-generation-farmer-has-a-unique-approach-to-soil-health). Original reporting for the magazine uses quotes rather than hyperlinks to source information. The website also curates market news from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, they do not publish opinion content; however, when covering politics, it relates to farming, such as this
[LAND STEWARDSHIP WOULD GET A MODEST INCREASE FROM BIDEN](https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/land-stewardship-would-get-a-modest-increase-from-biden). While reporting on the Biden administration is usually neutral or slightly favorable, reporting on the former Trump administration was not as positive such as this [TRUMP INTRUDES ON SPRING PLANTING FOR SECOND YEAR IN A ROW](https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/trump-intrudes-on-spring-planting-for-second-year-in-a-row). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias.
