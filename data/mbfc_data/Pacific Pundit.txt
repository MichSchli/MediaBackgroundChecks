Analysis / Bias
In review, Pacific Pundit exhibits extreme right-wing bias through wording and story selection that always favors the far right. For example, this headline:
[NFL THUGS WHO DISRESPECTED THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IN WEEK 7](http://www.pacificpundit.com/2017/10/22/nfl-thugs-who-disrespected-the-national-anthem-in-week-7/) uses a derogatory racial term to describe protesters of inequality and police violence. Pacific Pundit also does not source to credible media, for example, they use [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/): “ [CRAZY LEFTISTS PLAN ‘SCREAM HELPLESSLY AT THE SKY’ EVENT](http://www.pacificpundit.com/2017/10/20/crazy-leftists-plan-scream-helplessly-at-the-sky-event-for-nov-8/)” and [Blacksphere](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blacksphere-kevin-jackson/): “ [MAJOR DNC SHAKEUP – MEDIA SILENT.”](http://www.pacificpundit.com/2017/10/22/major-dnc-shakeup-media-silent/)
The website also frequently promotes right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories such as this:
[ILHAN OMAR DOESN’T DENY SHE SUPPORTS AL QAEDA AND COMMUNISM](https://www.pacificpundit.com/2019/07/15/ilhan-omar-doesnt-deny-she-supports-al-qaeda-and-communism/). A quote from the article demonstrates extremely loaded language that is not supported by evidence “Trump wanted to exposed these communists and terrorist sympathizers for who they are and it looks like he finally did it. They’ve been well hidden and protected by the media up until today. Now, they are basically the face of the communist Democrat party.”
