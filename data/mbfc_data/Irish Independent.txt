The Independent.ie is the online publication of the paper which covers news, including Ireland, World, Sport, Business, Entertainment, and Travel.
The Irish Independent first launched in 1891 as the
[Irish Daily Independent](http://www.nli.ie/en/NewspapersDetails.aspx?IndexNo=764), by [Charles Stewart Parnell.](https://www.thoughtco.com/charles-stewart-parnell-1773852) In 1900, after a merger, it became the Irish Daily Independent & Daily Nation and in 1905 it was [acquired by](https://books.google.com/books?id=1HTJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA375&lpg=PA375&dq=History+Irish+Daily+Independent&source=bl&ots=UaGQld0kFc&sig=ACfU3U36ciHQl8SkRzDCrKQUHDNNuAV8rw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnioLuxa7qAhWJY98KHbsJAPYQ6AEwGnoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=History%20Irish%20Daily%20Independent&f=false) anti-Parnellite, controversial politician businessman William Martin Murphy and became the Irish Independent.

Analysis / Bias
In 2020
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Ireland 13/180 in their [Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/ireland) stating that “Independent News and Media (INM) controlled much of the daily and Sunday newspaper market, while broadcasting was dominated by the semi-state company RTE.” [Micheal Martin](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/world/europe/ireland-prime-minister-micheal-martin.html) is the prime minister of Ireland and he is the leader of the center-right party, Fianna Fail.
The Irish Independent is considered
[a conservative](https://books.google.com/books?id=-cIhAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=the+Irish+Independent+is+considered+a+conservative+newspaper&source=bl&ots=IDELeT4Kwg&sig=ACfU3U28Np9gYTZCm-WigJva6KDCsOEiFQ&hl=en#v=onepage&q=the%20Irish%20Independent%20is%20considered%20a%20conservative%20newspaper&f=false) newspaper of Ireland. For example, during the 1997 general election, it endorsed Fianna Fáil with its editorial, titled [“It’s Payback Time”. ](https://books.google.com/books?id=GLvs5H1iDsQC&pg=PT145&lpg=PT145&dq=The+Irish++independent+editorial+endorsement&source=bl&ots=eZIYhXnE1n&sig=ACfU3U0zQamkXjC0i2OnTeOt8FcjO6PUmg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBrOaV_a7qAhXFnuAKHXJRAm8Q6AEwDXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Irish%20%20independent%20editorial%20endorsement&f=false)
In review, the Irish Independent reports local news with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Body of teen discovered in car in Dublin](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/body-of-teen-discovered-in-car-in-dublin-39335481.html). This story like most do not contain hyperlinked sourcing. The Irish Independent also has a section dedicated to political news that slightly favors the center-right Fianna Fail party such as this: [Micheál Martin ‘let down and grossly insulted’ Limerick City – Fianna Fáil TD](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/micheal-martin-let-down-and-grossly-insulted-limerick-city-fianna-fail-td-39334812.html).
Editorially, they occasionally report somewhat negatively on the Labour Party such as this:
[Is Burton really that keen to lead party into electoral meltdown?](https://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/is-burton-really-that-keen-to-lead-party-into-electoral-meltdown-29595154.html) They also use emotionally loaded wording in opinion pieces such as this [“Labour leader Alan Kelly says children should be allowed give grandparents a ‘quick hug’”](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/labour-leader-alan-kelly-says-children-should-be-allowed-give-grandparents-a-quick-hug-39259620.html). When covering world news, pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump Administration with a critical tone such as in this article “ [Trump’s attempt to paint Biden as ‘a puppet of the radical left’ is laughable”](https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/trumps-attempt-to-paint-biden-as-a-puppet-of-the-radical-left-is-laughable-39330229.html) and [“Rather than ‘end American carnage’, Trump has pushed it to a frightening new level.”](https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/rather-than-end-american-carnage-trump-has-pushed-it-to-a-frightening-new-level-39264421.html) In general, they report news mostly factually and with a slight right-leaning bias in editorial positions.
