History
Founded in 2016,
[The National Pulse](https://thenationalpulse.com/about/) is a Washington-based political news and news media publication. [The National Pulse](https://thenationalpulse.com/about/) promotes a conservative line on various issues such as Planned Parenthood, LGBT, and Common Core. The National Pulse is also affiliated with the questionable [American Principles Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-principles-project/), which advocates for immigration reform, banning abortions, and denying LGBTQ equal rights.

Funded by / Ownership
The National Pulse is owned by The
[American Principles Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Principles_Project) (APP), which is a 501(c)(3) think tank founded in 2009 by Robert George, Jeff Bell, and Frank Cannon. APP promotes a combination of libertarian and socially conservative policies. [The Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) has accused American Principles Project of [promoting conspiracies](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/margins-mainstream) but has not formally labeled them a hate group. Advertising, donation, and an APP generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Pulse’s reporting regarding politics uses strong, emotionally loaded words, such as in this article “
[LGBT Activists Spending Big to Elect Transgender Candidate in Virginia](https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/lgbt-activists-spending-big-elect-transgender-candidate-virginia/).” They also only cover one side of the story that favors their conservative causes. Although they source their articles, they are typically from far-right sources with poor track records with [fact-checkers](http://www.snopes.com/pp-baby-parts-sale/).
Editorially, they promote conservative policies such as
[anti-immigration](https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/did-president-trump-outsmart-democrats-immigration/), [anti-abortion](https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/poll-2020-democrat-candidates-reveals-radical-pro-abortion-stances/), and [anti-gay marriage](https://thenationalpulse.com/social-issues/trump-declines-to-promise-to-appoint-judges-who-would-overturn-gay-marriage/) positions. They also frequently rail against Planned Parenthood, such as this [10 Disturbing Facts from Planned Parenthood’s (Late) Annual Report](https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/10-disturbing-facts-planned-parenthood-late-annual-report/). Finally, The National Post occasionally promotes conspiracy theories such as this: [EXCLUSIVE: CCP-Linked Firm Targets U.S. Schoolkids With Chinese ‘Morality and Values,’ Shows CCP Military Parades in Schools](https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/chinese-utah-schools/). While elements of this article are true, the author claims, “In light of coronavirus, virtual learning is the only remaining avenue for the CCP to turn American school children into 21st century little red guards”, which is not supported by evidence. In this case, the author creates a conspiracy theory.
News and commentary generally contain extreme right perspectives that occasionally promote conspiracy theories, while the parent organization has made false claims.
