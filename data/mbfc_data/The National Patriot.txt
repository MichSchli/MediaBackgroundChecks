Analysis / Bias
The National Patriot publishes common right-wing conspiracies such as claiming
[The Obamassiah – More Demon Than Deity](The%20Obamassiah%20–%20More%20Demon%20Than%20Deity). At the same time, many stories are simply fake news, such as [Trouble Brewing in the Democratic Party](http://www.thenationalpatriot.com/2017/08/trouble-brewing-in-the-democratic-party/), which is rated [False](http://www.snopes.com/fbi-wasserman-schultz-home/) by Snopes.
Articles in 2021 use highly loaded emotional wording that always favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this
[Afghanistan and The Deliberate Destruction of America](https://www.thenationalpatriot.com/2021/08/afghanistan-and-the-deliberate-destruction-of-america/). Like the others we reviewed, this article contains minimal hyperlinked sourcing to credible media outlets. Generally, news reporting is low factual and presented with extreme right bias.
