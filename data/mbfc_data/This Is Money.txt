Analysis / Bias
This Is Money provides financial information such as current stock prices and currency values. The website also features news stories related to economic matters and generally presents this type of news with minimal bias, such as this
[Cuban coffee comes to UK for first time as Lavazza strikes deal with Sainsbury’s and Waitrose.](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-12844825/Lavazza-strikes-deal-bring-Cuban-coffee-UK-market-time.html) This story, like most on the website, does not contain hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, This Is Money aligns with the Daily Mail’s right-leaning perspectives, such as criticizing the Labour Party
[ALEX BRUMMER: Labour and its cut and paste shadow chancellor lack the big idea](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-12784827/ALEX-BRUMMER-Labour-cut-paste-shadow-chancellor-lack-big-idea.html). When reporting on climate change and vaccines, they do not hold the same skeptical views as the Daily Mail. In general, This Is Money holds a right-leaning bias regarding financial matters and is reasonably fact-based; however, the lack of hyperlinks in articles makes it difficult for the reader to check the veracity of their claims.
