Analysis / Bias
In review, The Verge primarily covers technology and science, with less emphasis on politics. However, when covering politics, they generally use minimally loaded words such as this:
[Presidential hopeful John Delaney wants you to unfollow Trump on Twitter](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514492/john-delaney-presidential-candidate-trump-unfollow-twitter). This story, like most, is properly sourced to credible left-leaning media sources such as The [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Political news is typically related to technology or science information, not just politics. When it comes to science reporting, The Verge aligns with the consensus of science. The Verge does not produce political editorial content, though story selection tends to favor the left slightly.
