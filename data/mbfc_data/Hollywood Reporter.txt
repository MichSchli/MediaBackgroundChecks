Analysis / Bias
Hollywood Reporter primarily covers entertainment, film industry news, and film-TV reviews. They typically do not publish opinion content unless it is in the form of a review. News is reported with moderately loaded wording like this:
[Oscars: In the Best Picture Race, Is Netflix Still Its Own Obstacle?](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-best-picture-race-is-netflix-still-own-obstacle-1269873) This story is sourced back to other Hollywood Reporter stories.
The Hollywood Reporter also has a political news section featuring original reporting and stories republished from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Original reporting often uses minimal to moderately biased wording and usually relates to the entertainment, TV, and film genres such as this: [Shepard Smith Could Be Picking Between CNN and MSNBC for His Next Job](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shepard-smith-could-be-picking-between-cnn-msnbc-his-next-job-1269537).
A thorough review of political coverage indicates that more stories favor the left, such as this:
[Greta Thunberg Slams Davos Elites on Climate as Trump Takes Stage](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/greta-thunberg-slams-davos-elites-climate-1271617). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias in story selection.
