History
[The DeSmogBlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSmogBlog), founded in January 2006, is a blog that focuses on topics related to global warming. The site describes itself as “the world’s number one source for accurate, fact-based information regarding Global Warming misinformation campaigns.” DeSmogBlog opposes what it describes as “a well-funded and highly organized public relations campaign” that it says is “poisoning” the [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) debate.

Analysis / Bias
DeSmog provides news regarding policy and corporate actions against climate science. They also have a list on their website that shows individual
[climate change deniers](https://www.desmogblog.com/global-warming-denier-database) and groups such as the [Heartland Institute](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/). While Desmog sources from credible scientific information, we rate this source left biased based on its political stance regarding climate change. This is an excellent source for researching who is funding climate science denial.
