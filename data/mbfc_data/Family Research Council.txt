History
The
[Family Research Council (FRC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council) is an American conservative Christian group and lobbying organization formed in the United States in 1981 by James Dobson. Tony Perkins is its current president. The FRC promotes traditional family values by advocating and lobbying for socially conservative policies. It opposes and lobbies against LGBT rights, abortion, divorce, embryonic stem-cell research, and pornography. In 2010, the [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) (SPLC) classified the FRC as an anti-gay hate group.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features a section called issues in which they publish news and information in opposition to abortion, such as this
[Supreme Court should put a stop to the abortion industry getting a free pass](https://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=PV20C01). Under this category, they also promote anti-LGBTQ sentiments such as this: [Why Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Should Never Be Specially Protected Categories Under the Law](https://www.frc.org/sogi). Further, FRC’s statements and positions have been criticized as being based upon [pseudoscience](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/trumps-transition-team-tied-anti-gay-pseudoscience/) or junk science; according to [Wired,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/) the group has misrepresented data and misdesigned sociological studies to depict LGBT people negatively.
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, FRC is a
[hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council) that “bills itself as “the leading voice for the family in our nation’s halls of power,” but its real specialty is defaming LGBTQ people.” Further, the [Human Rights Campaign](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-campaign/) has [criticized FRC](https://www.hrc.org/resources/10-facts-about-the-family-research-council) as well. The Family Research Council responded to the SPLC with [ANSWERING THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER’S ATTACKS UPON FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL](https://www.frc.org/issuebrief/answering-the-southern-poverty-law-centers-attacks-upon-family-research-council). In general, FRC promotes pseudoscience and Christian propaganda that often is not factual.
