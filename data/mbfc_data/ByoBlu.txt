Analysis / Bias
Byoblu.com has been criticized for publishing unsubstantiated medical claims, including false information about the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, an article titled
[“Pfizer vaccine, a 2-year-old American child dies after second shot”](https://www.byoblu.com/post/vaccino-pfizer-bambina-americana-di-due-anni-muore-dopo-la-seconda-dose) reported the death of a 2-year-old girl following the administration of the Pfizer vaccine without providing context about VAERS’ limitations. VAERS is a passive surveillance system that collects [unverified reports](https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html#:~:text=About%20VAERS%20and%20the%20Collected,.vaers.hhs.gov.), which cannot be used to establish causality.
Another example is a video interview headlined
[“PADS, LOCKDOWNS, MASKS: EVERYTHING THEY WON’T MAKE ME SAY ON TV – STEFANO MONTANARI,”](https://www.byoblu.com/post/tamponi-lockdown-mascherine-tutto-quello-che-non-mi-hanno-fatto-dire-in-tv-stefano-montanari/) which gives a platform to Dr. Stefano Montanari, who is known for making unsubstantiated health claims. The article criticizes mainstream media for not allowing Montanari to express his views, framing it as a freedom of expression issue. Byoblu presents itself as an alternative platform that allows Montanari to speak “without any type of censorship.”
The article implies that mainstream media censors alternative viewpoints by limiting Montanari’s airtime and editing his statements. This framing suggests a bias against mainstream media and health protocols related to COVID-19. The article does not make specific factual claims but focuses on the narrative that mainstream media suppresses alternative viewpoints. However, it’s worth noting that the views it promotes (those of Dr. Montanari) have been criticized for lacking factual basis. According to a
[fact-check by VoxUkraine](https://voxukraine.org/ru/video-fejk-stefano-montanari-razoblachaet-pravdu-o-vaktsinatsii-ot-koronavirusa), Montanari’s claims are false. Therefore, the article/video indirectly disseminates information unsupported by scientific evidence.
