Analysis / Bias
In review, The CMD website covers news with a strong left-leaning bias. Headlines and articles contain loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Massachusetts Law Could Blunt the Effect of Janus’s Attack on Unions](https://www.prwatch.org/news/2019/09/13495/massachusetts-law-could-blunt-effect-januss-attack-unions). Though biased, this story is properly sourced to the [Boston Globe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-globe/), [SourceWatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), and .gov websites. Story selection often favors [workers rights](https://www.prwatch.org/news/2019/07/13481/oregon-strengthens-public-workers-right-organize) and [fighting climate](https://www.prwatch.org/news/2019/09/13494/i-want-my-climate-back-promise-climate-restoration) change with proper information sourcing. In general, story selection and op-eds favor the progressive left.
