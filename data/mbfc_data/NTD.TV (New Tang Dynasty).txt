History
Founded in 2001, NTD TV (Not to be confused with Australian NTD (TV station) or New Tang Dynasty Television is a New York-based television broadcaster. According to their about page, NTD’s
[mission](http://www.ntd.tv/about/) is “At NTD we believe the integrity of our world hinges on the accurate and truthful spreading of information.” NTD TV was founded by a group of Chinese-American [Falun Gong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times) practitioners, which supports social conservatism, segregated paradises, and anti-communism, according to [RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Falun_Gong). The [Wall Street Journal states](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108190438992282143) that Falun Gong also founded the [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/).
However, an
[SF Gate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sfgate/) [article](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/CULTURE-AND-RELIGION-Dissident-media-linked-to-2587555.php) suggests that Executives at the Epoch Times, New Tang Dynasty, and Sound of Hope deny representing the movement. The [Chinese Government](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/ppflg/t397390.htm) considers the movement a cult, stating, “NTD.TV claims to be an independent public media organization serving Chinese people worldwide. But, in essence, it is a mouthpiece of ‘Falun Gong’ in the cult and anti-China propaganda.”
NTD TV’s primary focus is news, cultural shows, educational programs, sports, and entertainment.

Analysis / Bias
In review, NTD TV uses minimally loaded emotional language in its headlines, such as
[“Vice President Pence to Mueller Investigation: Very Respectfully, It’s Time to Wrap Up](http://www.ntd.tv/2018/05/11/vice-president-pence-to-mueller-investigation-very-respectfully-its-time-to-wrap-up/) “and “Mueller’s [ Russian Troll Case Returns to Bite Him as One Defendant Shows up for Trial.](http://www.ntd.tv/2018/05/10/muellers-russian-troll-case-returns-to-bite-him-as-one-defendant-shows-up-for-trial/) “New Tang Dynasty Television sources to their questionable right biased sister news media company the [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/) and they also republish articles from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Editorially, NTD TV supports conservative issues.
During the Coronavirus outbreak, they published false and misleading information such as Doctor’s cremating people alive in Wuhan, China:
[Video: Woman Says Coronavirus Patients Cremated Alive](https://www.ntd.com/video-woman-says-patients-cremated-alive_438495.html). This claim has never been proven. See failed fact checks below. Further, during the 2020 Presidential Election, they frequently floated conspiracy theories related to election fraud, such as this [Dominion Voting Machines Designed to Influence Results: Forensics Report](https://www.ntd.com/dominion-voting-machines-designed-to-influence-results-forensics-report_540449.html). Again, there is [no evidence](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/13/facebook-posts/no-evidence-dominion-voting-systems-caused-widespr/) to suggest this is true. In general, NTD TV is right-biased and frequently publishes false and misleading information.
