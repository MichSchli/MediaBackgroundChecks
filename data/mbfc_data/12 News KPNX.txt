Analysis / Bias
In review, 12 News KPNX reports local news primarily through TV news video and accompanying text. Local information is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[Wrong-way driver stopped on I-10 Sunday morning](https://www.12news.com/article/news/i10wrongwaydriver/75-48c19230-f301-4561-9731-aec941914e38). National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) as well as other TEGNA TV stations.
KPNX also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local Arizona politics through 12 News TV. Again, the wording is low biased such as this:
[What Arizona lawmakers have to say about Wednesday’s Iran briefing](https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/az-lawmakers-iran-reactions/75-fb0ddf36-1232-49ba-a1f6-d734d9163e89). Further, the website does not publish editorial commentary. Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
