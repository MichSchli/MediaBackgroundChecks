Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters without Borders,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) Belarus is ranked [153/180](https://rsf.org/en/belarus) in their World Press Freedom Index: “critical journalists and bloggers are threatened and arrested, leading news sites are blocked, access to information is restricted, and media is diversity is unknown.” The President of Belarus since 1994 is Alexander Lukashenko. He is independent and supported by the Belaya Rus, a big tent organization formed to support the President; however, Belaya Rus is not a political party. While the President is supposedly non-partisan, his [primary support](https://www.britannica.com/place/Belarus/Government-and-society) comes from left-leaning parties such as the Communist Party of Belarus (KPB), the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus, and the Agrarian Party. Opposition parties include the Party of the Belarusian Popular Front (BPF), the Conservative-Christian Party, and the right-of-center United Civic Party.

In 2019, the state-run news agency Belta opened a criminal case against Tut.by’s
[editor-in-chief](https://cpj.org/2019/02/tut-editor-in-belarus-court-on-charge-of-illegally/), for hacking its computer systems and stealing its data. The CPJ (Committee to Protect Journalists) said, “The raid on Tut.by and criminal charges brought against Zolatava show Belarus is looking for excuses to intimidate and persecute independent and critical media.”
In review, Tut.by uses minimally emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“The President wants to involve Interpol in the investigation of the Belgazprombank case. What they say about this in Interpol”](https://finance.tut.by/news693712.html?utm_source=news.tut.by&utm_medium=news-right-block&utm_campaign=popular-news) and [“Three companies with which presidential candidate Cherechen is connected are being liquidated. What is the reason?”](https://finance.tut.by/news693767.html) They also publish interviews with the opposition politicians, such as this interview with Belarusian presidential candidate Tikhanovskaya together with Kolesnikova and Tsepkalo [“There are 3.5 million of us. Let them try to say that we are a minority.”](https://news.tut.by/economics/693706.html)
Tut.by typically sources to local media such as Nasha Niva (Belarusian weekly newspapers), government sources such as state-owned TV channel CTV Belarus, mfa.gov (ministry of foreign affairs), and credible sources such as
[The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). Further, they republish [BBC articles](https://news.tut.by/world/692636.html) and utilize questionable sources such as the [Daily Mail.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) Regarding US politics, they report with a critical tone toward the Trump Administration [“Trump moved from New York to Florida due to taxes](https://news.tut.by/world/659654.html).”
