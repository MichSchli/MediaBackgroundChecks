Analysis / Bias
In review, Above the Law primarily publishes news and information geared toward law professionals. For example, they give career advice and firm salaries and rankings. Essentially, this is considered an insider publication for attorneys. Most stories do not contain loaded emotional language such as this
[AI in healthcare has spurred exciting applications and collaboration](https://medcitynews.com/2020/01/ai-in-healthcare-has-spurred-exciting-applications-and-collaborations/). This story is appropriately sourced.
Editorially, Above the Law does not have a favorable opinion of former President Trump with stories such as this:
[International Law Expert Thinks Donald Trump Might Not Understand How Any Of This Works](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/international-law-expert-thinks-donald-trump-might-not-understand-how-any-of-this-works/). While ATL is not overtly left-biased by any means, they certainly [do not favor](https://abovethelaw.com/?s=trump) the current administration. In general, the information on this website is factual, with a left-leaning bias in story selection.
