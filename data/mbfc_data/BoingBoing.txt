Analysis / Bias
In review, Boing Boing covers a wide range of topics from technology to lifestyle; however, we will focus on those related to politics for this review. Boing Boing uses moderately loaded language in their headlines:
[Why did Trump make the “white power” hand signal when he mentioned AOC at the Young Conservatives DC summit?](https://boingboing.net/2019/07/25/why-did-trump-make-the-white.html) And this [Grifty conservative PACs raised millions pushing racist Obama conspiracies to elderly, low-income supporters, then kept almost all of it](https://boingboing.net/2019/07/26/make-america-grift-again-2.html). This last story is correctly sourced to [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) and [ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/).
In general, most stories present an opening statement followed by an excerpt from another source and then left-leaning commentary added. Story selection almost always favors the left.
