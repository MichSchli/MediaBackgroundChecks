History
[Founded in 2006](http://whois.domaintools.com/freedomadvocates.org), Freedom Advocates is a website that is opposed to Agenda 21, which the United Nations established in 1992. Agenda 21 sets out goals for public policy at all levels and for civic action by non-governmental organizations. “ [Agenda 21](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/outcomedocuments/agenda21) is a comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the United Nations System, Governments, and Major Groups in every area in which human impacts on the environment.” In other words, Agenda 21 seeks the sustainability of resources. Many conspiracy theorists, including Alex Jones of [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), believe Agenda 21 is a path to the [New World Order](http://agenda21news.com/2014/07/agenda-21-dummies-new-world-order-depopulation-exposed/).
According to the Freedom Advocates
[about page](https://www.freedomadvocates.org/about-us/), their mission “is to advance the principles of freedom to individuals and government through public discourse.” The website is run by Author [Patrick Wood](http://globalbem.com/program/patrick-wood/), who claims to be a sustainability expert and an anti-globalist. Patrick Wood is a frequent guest on conspiracy shows such as [The Common Sense Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjCBd71X6Ak), [The Mind Renewed](https://themindrenewed.com/transcripts/919-int-078t), and [Infowars](https://www.infowars.com/video-technocracy-rising-the-scientific-elites-global-matrix-of-control/).

Funded by / Ownership
Freedom Advocates does not openly state ownership; however, it appears Patrick Wood may be the website owner. The website also appears to be a vehicle for Mr. Wood to
[sell his books](https://www.freedomadvocates.org/shop/) and related books from others.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the purpose of this website is to oppose Agenda 21 while promoting Mr. Woods’ books. Freedom Advocates describes Agenda 21 as
[Cultural Marxism](https://www.freedomadvocates.org/shop/) and the [New World Order](https://www.freedomadvocates.org/technocracys-endgame-global-smart-grid/). The irony of this [position](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Agenda_21) is “the U.S. government and no state or local government is legally bound by the United Nations Agenda 21 treaty.”
Agenda 21 opponents have been described as far-right
[anti-Government conspiracy theorists](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/antigovernment-conspiracy-theorists-rail-against-un%E2%80%99s-agenda-21-program). Due to Agenda 21’s concern for sustainability, they advocate for reductions in Co2; however, Freedom Advocates claim that [climate change is a fraud,](https://www.freedomadvocates.org/despite-crumbling-climate-change-consensus-iclei-marches-on/) which contradicts the [consensus of science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Generally, this is a far-right conspiracy website.
