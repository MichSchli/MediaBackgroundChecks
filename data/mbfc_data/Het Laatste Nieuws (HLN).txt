Analysis / Bias
In 2021,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Belgium 11/180 in their [Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/belgium). The Prime Minister of Belgium is [Alexander De Croo](https://www.voanews.com/europe/7-parties-agree-belgian-government-led-liberal-de-croo) who leans center-right (The [coalition government](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-parliamentary-elections-archive-elections-3bf390ed4a780673027c937fe2f164da) consists of Liberals, Socialists, and Greens)
In review, Het Laatste Nieuws (HLN) site contains big pictures and publishes news in a tabloid-style. For example, they use emotionally loaded wording in their headlines such as
[“Laura (30) has known for a year that she has HIV: “Even my doctor said: do you have such a wild sex life?”](https://www.hln.be/fit-en-gezond/laura-30-weet-sinds-een-jaar-dat-ze-hiv-heeft-zelfs-mijn-huisarts-zei-heb-jij-dan-zo-n-wild-seksleven~a92cf3bf/) It also provides breaking news, for example, first they reported with the headline [“Police shut down sex party in Brussels: Member of the European Parliament also present.”](https://www.hln.be/brussel/politie-legt-seksfeestje-in-brussel-stil-ook-europarlementslid-aanwezig~ab43ad0f/) Then in the same story, they reported with the headline [“Hungarian MEP resigns after attending sex party in Brussels.”](https://www.hln.be/brussel/hongaars-europarlementslid-neemt-ontslag-na-aanwezigheid-op-seksfeestje-in-brussel~ab43ad0f/) When it comes to sourcing they provide circular links so that the same story is linked to this story [“Hungarian MEP surprisingly resigns”.](https://www.hln.be/buitenland/hongaars-europarlementslid-neemt-verrassend-ontslag~a98aa07d/) In other words, they do not source well to outside media outlets.
Het Laatste Nieuws (HLN) reports political news in a neutral tone such as this
[“Vlaams Belang puts Carrera Neefs out of the party after her controversial visit to SS’er’s grave“](https://www.hln.be/binnenland/vlaams-belang-zet-carrera-neefs-uit-de-partij-na-haar-omstreden-bezoek-aan-graf-ss-er~a20f708a/). In a study The political orientation of the readers according to a [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343583266_Reach_or_Trust_Optimisation_A_Citizen_Trust_Analysis_in_the_Flemish_Public_Broadcaster_VRT) article published by Open Access publisher Cogitatio “trust in Het Laatste Nieuws is significantly lower amongst left-wing citizens.” Another [article](https://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/download/Case-study-Fake-News-Belgium.pdf) titled ‘Fake news’ and online disinformation Case study – Belgium” by the Institute for Information Law (IViR) Amsterdam Law School states that Het Laatste Nieuws (HLN) has been referred to as one of the Flemish news media sites which regularly publishes “misleading or inaccurate news articles.”
When it comes to sourcing HLN.be utilizes
[Belga](https://www.hln.be/binnenland/immigratie-op-historisch-hoog-peil-deze-nationaliteiten-vestigen-zich-het-vaakst-in-belgie~a7035d27/) (Belgium news agency) and national sources such as Dag Allemaal (family magazine). HLN is the digital partner of VTM Nieuws (Flemish television network VTM). HTL also [launched](https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/15430/dpg-media-launches-hln-live-news-channel-with-qvest-media-cloud) in April 2020, which is a 24/7 live news video stream in Flanders (HLN LIVE). When reporting on USA news they generally rely on the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) such as this [US Attorney General: “No Evidence of Fraud That Would Change Election Outcome”](https://www.hln.be/verkiezingen-vs/vs-minister-van-justitie-geen-bewijs-van-fraude-die-verkiezingsuitkomst-zou-veranderen~ade36cca/). In general, news reporting is mostly factual, however, some stories are poorly sourced, sensationalized, and sometimes misleading.
