Analysis / Bias
In review, LNP reports on news, sports, business, and lifestyle through reporters with minimal bias, such as this:
[Woman sues suspended funeral director Andrew T. Scheid, Lancashire Hall over handling of body](https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/woman-sues-suspended-funeral-director-andrew-t-scheid-lancashire-hall-over-handling-of-body/article_3ada9f82-a604-11ea-9eae-4fedf103d613.html). The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) provides national and international news.
Editorially, LNP used to have two editorial boards. In 2012 one endorsed President Obama and the other Republican Mitt Romney. However, in 2016 they endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. A review of the opinion page reveals balance with slightly more favoring the right. In general, they report news factually and offer reasonably balanced editorials.
