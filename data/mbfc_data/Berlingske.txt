Analysis / Bias
In review, Berlingske often covers news on culture, art, and society with sensational headlines and extensive use of images:
[“When the mother returned, her daughter said just one phrase: “I hate you.”](https://www.berlingske.dk/kultur/20.-laage-da-moderen-vendte-tilbage-sagde-hendes-datter-blot-en-enkelt) Berlingske also publishes political articles with emotionally loaded language; for example, when covering the recent British elections, they use favorable, emotionally loaded headlines for conservative Boris Johnson, such as this: [“The Boris Johnson Rule: Business can learn one thing from his big election victory.”](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/boris-johnson-reglen-erhvervslivet-kan-laere-en-ting-af-hans-store)
They also publish articles critical of the
[Center-Right ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_liberalism) [Venstre, Danmarks Liberale Parti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venstre_(Denmark)) leader Jakob Ellemann-Jensen such as: [“Following the Armed Forces scandal: Ellemann’s proposal is called “utterly hopeless to implement.”](https://www.berlingske.dk/politik/efter-skandalen-i-forsvaret-ellemanns-forslag-bliver-kaldt-fuldstaendig) On the issues, they frequently publish anti-immigration and anti-Muslim articles such as [“Ruud Koopmans has been researching integration for more than 20 years – and he cannot point to a single Western country that is successful in integrating Muslims.”](https://www.berlingske.dk/debatinterview/ruud-koopmans-har-forsket-i-integration-i-mere-end-20-aar-og-han)
Regarding sourcing, Berlingske often hyperlinks to themselves and
[local sources](https://www.berlingske.dk/internationalt/han-afsloerer-den-russiske-propaganda) such as [euvsdisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu) and the Danish News Agency Ritzau. They also link to credible news sources such as [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and [Reuters.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) When covering world news about the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a favorable tone, such as in this article: [“The crucial blow to the war against Trump.”](https://www.berlingske.dk/kommentatorer/det-afgoerende-slag-i-krigen-mod-trump)
