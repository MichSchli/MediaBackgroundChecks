Analysis / Bias
Proto Thema was previously known to have
[a liberal](https://www.mediabuzz.org/newspapers/greek/) stance; however, at present, their views are favorable to the center-right [New Democracy Party](https://www.politico.eu/article/kyriakos-mitsotakis-greece-trojan-trump-new-democracy-party/).
In review, Proto Thema headlines are moderately emotional such as this
[“Turkish President Erdogan provokes again: My dream as a boy was to free Hagia Sophia.”](http://en.protothema.gr/turkish-president-erdogan-provokes-again-my-dream-as-a-boy-was-to-free-hagia-sophia/) Articles are typically sourced with large quotes, and they [republish](http://en.protothema.gr/novartis-probe-finds-no-trace-of-payoffs-to-greek-officials/) stories from [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Politically, they tend to favor the right; for example, when covering Greek politics, Proto Thema uses moderately emotionally loaded headlines and avoids criticism when covering the [Center-Right](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48902766) New Democracy party leader and current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis: [“Kyriakos Mitsotakis posts photo of his adorable dog.](http://en.protothema.gr/kyriakos-mitsotakis-posts-photo-of-his-adorable-dog-photo/)”
On the other hand, they critically cover former Prime Minister and left-wing Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras, such as
[“SYRIZA leader Tsipras covers ex-Minister Pappas amid Kalogritsas “White House” backlash](http://en.protothema.gr/syriza-leader-tsipras-covers-ex-minister-pappas-amid-kalogritsas-white-house-backlash/).” This article is poorly sourced and does not provide hyperlinks to the documents they claim to have released. Further, Proto Thema publishes sensational stories such as [“She has tattoos, she is hot, she is perfect! (sexy photos)”.](http://en.protothema.gr/she-has-tattoos-she-is-hot-she-is-perfect-sexy-photos/)
On political issues such as immigration, Proto Thema negatively reports
[here](http://en.protothema.gr/illegal-immigrants-and-refugees-set-up-bbqs-in-attica-forest-despite-high-risk-video/) and [here](http://en.protothema.gr/new-footage-from-evros-illegal-immigrants-throw-turkish-made-tear-gases-to-the-greek-forces-video-photos/). Finally, a Europa.eu evaluation [report](https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/librarydoc/mediva-newspaper-evaluation-for-greek-newspaper-proto-thema) describes Proto Thema as “It is known for its populist orientation and hate speech approach mainly to migration and migrant-related news and themes.” Proto Thema covers the Trump Administration mostly through [ mcclatchydc.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mcclatchydc/) and the factually mixed [NDTV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ndtv/). Proto Thema generally demonstrates a right-leaning editorial bias and is not a reliable source for factual information.
