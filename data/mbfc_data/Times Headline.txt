Analysis / Bias
Times Headline utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines, such as:
[“Rohingya Muslims are a security threat, Govt’s unfinalized affidavit’](https://www.timesheadline.com/world/the-rohingya-muslims-are-a-security-threat-government-says-7933.html).” It uses credible left-leaning news sources such as [Hindustan Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hindustan-times/), but they don’t provide links to the sources. Times Headline reports US news with low bias, and they use credible sources such as [Haaretz](https://www.timesheadline.com/u-s/trumps-son-laws-secret-trip-saudi-arabia-10743.html), but again without hyperlinks. In general, story selection very slightly favors the left.
Overall, the Times Headline is left-center biased in their editorial pieces and mixed factually due to a lack of links to sourced information. (M. Huitsing 10/31/2017) Updated (12/31/2022)
