Analysis
Radio Televisión Martí owner
[USAGM](https://www.usagm.gov/networks/) states that “USAGM ensures that our networks’ program decisions reflect the U.S. national interest.” Radio Televisión Martí produces content critical of the Cuban government and aims to reach the Cuban public with pro-US messages. Further, they have been called a propaganda arm of the US Government.
According to an
[NPR ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) [article](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/30/662052937/u-s-agency-investigates-taxpayer-funded-anti-semitism-against-george-soros) in 2018, Marti broadcasted a TV segment attacking George Soros promoting [anti-Semite conspiracy theories](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-col-grimm-radio-tv-marti-20181123-story.html) such as “Jewish financiers controlling the world.” In 2019, an internal audit was conducted, and according to their report, “ [TV and Radio Martí plagued by “bad journalism,” “ineffective propaganda.”](https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article230765259.html) A quote from the article reads, “The auditors concluded that the stations, designed to broadcast unbiased news to Cuba, are “an anachronism.” The report further states, “Martí openly engages in both propaganda and the promotion of a current administration’s foreign policy, in this case towards Cuba (as well as Venezuela and Nicaragua).” Here is the full 2019 internal audit [report](https://www.usagm.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Embarking-on-OCB-Reform-English.pdf).
Bias
Radio Televisión Martí presents news that is generally in line with the American Government’s narrative. For instance, during President Trump’s administration Marti would
[broadcast](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/us-government-funded-news-network-ran-a-hit-piece-on-soros-that-called-him-a-multimillionaire-jew/) conspiracy theories. Its [anchor](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/sur-de-la-florida/article246288560.html) and producer, Tomás N. Regalado, known as Tommy, would refer to [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/) as “a good source.” Judicial Watch is rated as Questionable and of low credibility by MBFC and other [media raters](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/judicialwatch.org?cid=04dab292-85f2-47b6-b18c-097b097f9da8).
Radio Television Marti uses strong loaded language in their headlines and news stories such as this:
[“Tens of thousands of signatories ask the US for a military intervention against the “terrorist and genocidal dictatorship” in Cuba”](https://www.radiotelevisionmarti.com/a/decenas-de-miles-de-firmantes-piden-a-eeuu-una-intervenci%C3%B3n-militar-contra-la-dictadura-terrorista-y-genocida-en-cuba/299195.html) and [“They repressed with dogs, beatings and massive arrests: “In front of the Capitol, on the Malecón and La Punta there was a lot of repression.”](https://www.radiotelevisionmarti.com/a/perros-de-presa-golpizas-y-detenciones-fue-la-respuesta-del-r%C3%A9gimen-el-11-7-al-reclamo-de-los-cubanos-/299199.html) In general, the primary purpose of Marti is to promote U.S. Government interests, which includes putting pressure on the current communist government of Cuba. As a result, Marti frequently publishes one-sided propaganda.
