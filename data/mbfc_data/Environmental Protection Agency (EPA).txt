History
In 1970, to respond to the rising level of public concern about environmental pollution, the
[Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/) was created. As a federal agency in the United States, the EPA’s primary objective is safeguarding human health and the environment. The EPA ensures clean air, land, and water for Americans, reduces environmental risks based on scientific information, administers and enforces federal laws protecting health and the environment, and integrates environmental stewardship into the U.S. Michael S. Regan is the current Administrator of the EPA. The EPA headquarters is in Washington, D.C.

Funded by / Ownership
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not explicitly state its funding sources on its
[funding instruments and authorities page](https://www.epa.gov/grants/epa-funding-instruments-and-authorities). Nevertheless, it explains how the EPA uses its funding and outlines the legal and regulatory framework in which it operates. Conversely, data from [usaspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/environmental-protection-agency?fy=2023) shows the total amount allocated to the EPA by the end of July 2023.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides crucial information about safeguarding human health and the environment in the USA. For instance, an article on
[Acid Rain](https://www.epa.gov/acidrain) provides comprehensive, science-backed information about its causes, effects, and mitigation strategies, reflecting the EPA’s commitment to delivering factual and research-driven content. However, it’s noteworthy that the content and policy emphasis can reflect the current administration.
For instance, an article published in 2020 titled
[“ICYMI: Trump Administration Has Removed Environmental Regulations that Hamstring American Businesses”](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-trump-administration-has-removed-environmental-regulations-hamstring-american) demonstrates a policy perspective aligned with the [Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) administration’s approach towards deregulation and economic considerations. The article uses specific wording, such as describing regulations as “duplicative” and stating they “hamstring American businesses,” which indicates a bias toward portraying regulatory measures negatively and emphasizing economic considerations.
In contrast, during the
[Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) administration, an article titled [“Biden-Harris Administration Proposes Strongest-Ever Pollution Standards for Cars and Trucks to Accelerate Transition to a Clean-Transportation Future”](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-and) reflects a different tone and policy emphasis. The language used, such as “strongest-ever pollution standards” and “accelerate the ongoing transition to a clean vehicles future,” indicates a pro-environmental stance and a focus on aggressive measures to tackle climate change and improve air quality, which demonstrates that while the EPA’s information is scientifically grounded, the framing and policy emphasis may vary with the prevailing political leadership, showcasing a potential administrative bias in its communication and policy promotion.
