History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/noqreport.com), NOQ Report is a conservative news and opinion website. NOQ stands for news, opinions, and quotes. According to their [about page](https://noqreport.com/what-is-noqreport/), they state their mission as fighting fake news by the mainstream media. They [further state](https://noqreport.com/what-is-noqreport/), “If you’re tired of the spin that populates the airwaves and fills the news cycles, remember NOQ Report. We don’t claim to not have spin. Our biases are evident. The difference is that our spin is in a direction that benefits America. Mainstream media is not our friend, and they shouldn’t be yours, either.”
The website is transparent in

Analysis / Bias
In review, NOQ Report publishes news and commentary with a conservative perspective. The website does not produce original news reporting but covers existing news stories and offers opinions about the story. The wording of headlines and articles often contain emotionally loaded language such as this:
[If Corbyn had won, American leftists here would be making grand comparisons](https://noqreport.com/2019/12/13/corbyn-won-american-leftists-making-grand-comparisons/). This story, which is an unlabeled opinion piece, does not contain any form of sourcing and contains highly emotional wording within the article, such as this: “This is an idiotic move by the Democrat-friendly media, but I won’t stop them. Let them try to salvage and rework the narrative.” When it comes to sourcing, most stories are either not sourced or self-link back to themselves.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left. They also do not align with the consensus of science regarding human-influenced
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and they promote biblical conspiracy theories such as this: [Does Bible prophecy point to climate change ALARMISM as the real existential threat?](https://noqreport.com/2019/09/23/bible-prophecy-point-climate-change-alarmism-real-existential-threat/) The basic conspiracy here is that climate change is a tool used to implement socialism. Finally, in 2020 and 2021, NOQ report frequently published false and misleading information regarding the Coronavirus and the Presidential Election.
