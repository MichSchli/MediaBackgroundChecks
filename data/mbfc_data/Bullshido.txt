History
Founded in 2002, Bullshido is a news and opinion website with a tagline that reads “The Art of Fighting BS.” According to their
[about page](https://www.bullshido.net/about/), “In the “wild west” days of the Internet back in 2002, a handful of disgruntled jerks came together to create an open platform where people could call out bullshit without fear of censorship, reprisal, or interference on the part of the editorial staff. Those folks were predominately Martial Artists; consequently, the bullshit they called out primarily involved the Martial Arts: things like “chi” and no-touch knockouts, magic ninja powers, ridiculously ineffective fighting techniques, and training practices.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Bullshido is owned by Creative Combat LLC, which is, in turn, owned by
[Neal Fletcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phrost/). The website generates revenue through the sale of [branded merchandise](https://www.bullshido.net/product/bullshido-no-bs-hat/) and podcast revenue from a variety of sources.
Analysis / Bias
Bullshido can be classified into several different categories. They could easily be placed in our
[Pro-Science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pro-science/) category as they are evidence-based and routinely debunk pseudosciences. Bullshido also produces snarky articles that make you laugh out loud, which could land them in the [satire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/satire/) category. Bullshido is all these things, so I can only place them in the least biased category.
Bullshido does have a strong bias against BS, and it uses evidence to support all claims. They use colorful language in their articles, and there is an excellent use of sarcasm to make points. In summary, this is an excellent source for debunking conspiracies, pseudoscience, and false equivalencies.
