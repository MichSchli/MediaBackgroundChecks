History
[Founded in 1910](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Endowment_for_International_Peace), The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) is a foreign-policy think tank with centers in Washington, D.C., Moscow, Beirut, Beijing, Brussels, and New Delhi. The organization describes itself as being dedicated to advancing cooperation between nations and promoting active international engagement by the United States. Andrew Carnegie founded it, and its work is not formally associated with any political party. The current President is [Bill Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Joseph_Burns).
According to their
[about page](https://carnegieendowment.org/about/?lang=en), “In an increasingly crowded, chaotic, and contested world and marketplace of ideas, the Carnegie Endowment offers decision-makers global, independent, and strategic insight and innovative ideas that advance international peace.”
In the University of Pennsylvania’s 2015 Global Go To Think Tanks Report, Carnegie is ranked the third most influential think tank globally, after the

Analysis / Bias
In review, the primary objective of CEIP is the promotion of peace. The website offers moderately biased research, such as this:
[How Impeachment Affects Trump’s Foreign Policy](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/12/19/how-impeachment-affects-trump-s-foreign-policy-pub-80655). This story is republished from [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Another research story is original and is in-depth and well-sourced: [The Case for Transatlantic Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/12/18/case-for-transatlantic-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-pub-80632). The website also features a list of projects and programs they are involved in.
Editorially, CEIP features an opinion section that derives commentary from outside sources and originally written content. For example, this story comes from
[NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/): [Netanyahu’s Staying Power Reflects Israel’s Rightward Shift](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/12/17/netanyahu-s-staying-power-reflects-israel-s-rightward-shift-pub-80641). Other Op-Ed’s are explicitly written for CEIP, such as this: [Trump’s Crude Justification](https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/80517). Op-Eds from other sources come from [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), and [38 North](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/38-north/). In general, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is factual in reporting information but moderately left-biased through editorial positions and sources used.
