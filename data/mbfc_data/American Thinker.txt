[“The Most Memorable Leftist Hypocrisies of 2017-8”.](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2018/12/the_most_memorable_leftist_hypocrisies_of_20178.html) This article is authored by [Robert Oscar Lopez, ](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/walt-hawkins/american-stinker_b_3128470.html)who writes with extremely biased language: “The left is composed of horrible people. Most sane people realize this, even if they have friends on the dark side.” Another article with loaded wording is this one: [“The Great Depression of 2019?”](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/01/the_great_depression_of_2019.html) Although they utilize credible sources such as [thebalance.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-balance/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and factually mixed sources such as [LifeZette,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lifezette/) [Wall Street Journal,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) [Human Events.com,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-events/) they also utilize questionable sources to back their claims, such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and non-credible conservative blogs such as michaelsavage.com.

[published](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/04/23/american-thinker-needs-start-thinking) Anti-LGBT articles and those by prominent white nationalist [Jared Taylor.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jared-taylor) Further, American Thinker routinely publishes conspiracy theories, such as those by [Pamela Geller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geller-report/). The latter is also on the SPLC’s hate watch list due to anti-Islam positions: [Report: Obama said ‘I Am a Muslim](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2010/06/report_obama_said_i_am_a_musli.html),’ which has been debunked as a [false claim](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/who-is-barack-obama/). They have also promoted [conspiracies](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2018/01/was_seth_rich_killed_over_the_steele_dossier.html) about the Seth Rich Murder, and they have published numerous articles that are not supportive of the [consensus of science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), such as this one: [The Hoax of ‘Climate Change.’](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2018/12/the_hoax_of_climate_change.html)
