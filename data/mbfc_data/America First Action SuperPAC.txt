Analysis / Bias
Director of advocacy for America First Policies
[Carl Higbie](https://www.americafirstpolicies.org/updates/america-first-policies-announces-carl-higbie-as-director-of-advocacy/) is known for making racist, sexist, anti-Muslim, and anti-gay remarks. CNN published [audio clips](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/18/politics/kfile-carl-higbie-on-the-radio/index.html) taken from the Internet talk radio program “Sound of Freedom,” and he has also pushed the birther conspiracy about Barack Obama [on the radio](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/19/16911372/racist-comments-trump-appointees-carl-higbie-americorps).
According to the Brennan Center For Justice, America First Policies has
[spent millions of dollars](https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/america-first-policies-nonprofit-run-trump-strategists-spends-millions-secret-donors-promoting) to promote President Trump’s SCOTUS nominees such as Kavanaugh and many other conservatives.
The website publishes right-leaning news stories written by America First Action staff. Many stories are published in credible media outlets such as
[The Hill](https://www.a1apac.org/news/the-paradox-of-the-lefts-feminist-movement/) and [Real Clear Politics](https://www.a1apac.org/news/women-are-winning-in-the-trump-era/). The articles that appear in other media outlets are properly sourced, whereas those posted on the a1apac website are not sourced. Some news articles use emotionally loaded headlines such as this: [TV Ads Expose Radical West Virginia Leftist Richard Ojeda For Opposition To Trump](https://www.a1apac.org/news/tv-ads-expose-radical-west-virginia-leftist-richard-ojeda-for-opposition-to/).

In March 2019, David Clark was [fired](https://newsone.com/3847825/david-clarke-fox-news-trump/) from Fox News and America Action First due to “rhetoric that became crazier and crazier.” Further, the director has also promoted the Obama Birther conspiracy, which has been thoroughly [debunked](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/09/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-still-claim-obama-wasnt-born-us/).
