History
The Flat Earth Society, a modern proponent of the flat Earth theory, originated in the 19th century with English writer Samuel Rowbotham. The society promotes the pseudoscientific belief that the Earth is flat, contrary to established scientific consensus. It is not clear where this website originates from.

Analysis / Bias
The TFES website represents extreme pseudoscientific views and science denial. It embraces conspiracy theories to counteract overwhelming scientific evidence of the Earth’s sphericity. The society’s content, including forums and articles, consistently disregards scientific methodology, preferring personal conjecture and misinterpretation of observations.
- “Mad” Mike Hughes – an untimely departure:
[This post](https://www.tfes.org/)commemorates Michael Hughes, a daredevil who lost his life in a self-constructed steam-powered rocket, portraying him as a martyr for the flat Earth movement.
- Response to “Behind The Curve” Documentary: The website criticizes the documentary “Behind The Curve” for its portrayal of Flat Earth theory. The post argues against the documentary’s scientific experiments and suggests conspiracy by stating that the results of an experiment confirming a round Earth were selectively presented. It also discusses the use of a Ring Laser Gyroscope and disputes its ability to measure Earth’s rotation, which is indicative of their rejection of scientific evidence.
These examples demonstrate the site’s tendency to promote conspiracy theories, reject scientific evidence, and propagate pseudoscientific ideas. The overall content of the website is aligned with extreme science denial, selectively cherry-picking information that supports their narrative while dismissing vast amounts of scientific evidence to the contrary.
As of this review, the website does not produce much original content; however, the forum remains active, with users posting flat earth theories.
Failed Fact Checks
- The core beliefs of the TFES, such as the Earth being flat, directly contradict established scientific facts and are inherently pseudoscientific.
