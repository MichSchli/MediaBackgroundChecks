History
Founded in 1837, the Clarion Ledger is a daily broadsheet newspaper from Jackson, Mississippi that is circulated statewide.
Until the 1970’s the Clarion Ledger was openly racist with the paper referring to
[ civil rights activists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clarion-Ledger) as “communists” and “chimpanzees.” The paper’s racism was so virulent that it prompted some in the African-American community to call it “The Klan-Ledger.” However, in the 1970s the editorial direction changed resulting in them winning the [Pulitzer Prize for Public Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Public_Service), in 1983 for a package of stories on Mississippi’s education system.
