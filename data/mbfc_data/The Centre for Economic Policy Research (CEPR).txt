History
Founded in 1983,
[The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)](https://cepr.org/about), not to be confused with the unrelated American [Center for Economic and Policy Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-center-for-economic-and-policy-research/), describes its goal as “to enhance the quality of economic policy-making within Europe and beyond.” The CEPR headquarters are in London-UK. [Richard David Portes](http://faculty.london.edu/rportes/) is the founder and president of CEPR. The organization’s website has several categories: VoxEU (EPR’s policy analysis and commentary portal), its founder Richard Baldwin, Research, Publications, and Events (conferences and seminars).

Analysis / Bias
CEPR publishes articles utilizing neutral headlines such as:
[“The political consequences of the Covid pandemic: Lessons from cross-country polling data.”](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/political-consequences-covid-pandemic-lessons-cross-country-polling-data) and” [Refugee migration and the labour market: Lessons from 40 years of post-arrival policies in Denmark.”](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/refugee-migration-and-labour-market-lessons-40-years-post-arrival-policies-denmark)
In analyzing, the articles are balanced and well sourced. When reporting on climate change, they publish articles such as
[“Combatting climate change: A CEPR collection,”](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/combatting-climate-change-cepr-collection) written,” from the economist’s perspective.” CEPR takes a pro-science position regarding climate change stating the consensus, “The recent experiences of severe weather events – floods, fires, droughts, and storms – visibly drive home what scientists have been saying for years: global warming threatens life on a planetary scale; it is man-made, predictable and, although not reversible, its further escalation is mitigable.”
In general, CEPR produces low-biased research that is well-sourced and fact-based.
