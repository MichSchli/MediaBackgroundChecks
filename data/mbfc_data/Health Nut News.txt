Analysis / Bias
In review, Health Nut News (Erin Elizabeth) is a website that publishes news on
[alternative health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/), the environment, recipes, and politics. Headlines often feature strong emotional language such as this: [Connecticut DCF punishing Tennessee parents for taking their story public? Refuse to let parents visit baby](https://www.healthnutnews.com/connecticut-dcf-punishing-tennessee-parents-for-taking-their-story-public-refuse-to-let-parents-visit-baby/). This story comes directly from [Health Impact News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-impact-news/), which is a Conspiracy and Pseudoscience website that promotes [anti-vaccine propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), as well as [chemtrail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) conspiracies. Health Nut News frequently utilizes unreliable sources such as [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) and [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), which both have numerous false claims attributed to them.
In general, HHN frequently promotes Anti-Vaccination propaganda and consistently insists on a link between
[Autism and vaccines](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/), which is not supported by science. HHN also rejects the consensus of science regarding [chemtrails and GMOs](https://www.healthnutnews.com/german-doctor-links-nano-aluminum-glyphosate-and-parasites-to-chronic-disease-develops-healing-protocol/). They also promote [conspiracy theories](https://www.healthnutnews.com/are-cancer-cures-being-suppressed-to-control-population/) such as the Government suppressing cures for [cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) to control the population. Lastly, Erin Elizabeth dreamed up a conspiracy theory that [holistic Doctors are being killed](https://archive.fo/E4M1H#selection-731.0-734.0), supposedly by the pharmaceutical industry. Needless to say, this has been [thoroughly debunked](https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/04/04/nipsey-hussle-murder/).
