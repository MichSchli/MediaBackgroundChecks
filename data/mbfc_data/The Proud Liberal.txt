Analysis / Bias
In review, The Proud Liberal publishes news and opinion pieces that favor the left with the use of loaded emotional language such as this
[Trump 2020 Campaign Accused Money Laundering; Federal Election Officials Open Investigation](http://theproudliberal.org/trump-2020-campaign-accused-money-laundering-federal-election-officials-open-investigation/). Most stories are sensationalized and allude to alleged crimes committed by conservatives, such as this [After She Snubbed a Congressional Subpoena, Former Trump Advisor Kellyanne Conway Face Jail Time and Fines](http://theproudliberal.org/after-she-snubbed-a-congressional-subpoena-former-trump-advisor-kellyanne-conway-face-jail-time-and-fines/). When it comes to sourcing, we found some articles to be properly sourced and some not all.
Editorially, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right. In general, the news is reported with a far-left bias that may not always be factual. This is a propaganda source that lacks credibility due to a lack of transparency.
