Known for introducing concepts like “carbon bubble” and
[“unburnable carbon,”](https://carbontracker.org/terms/unburnable-carbon/#:~:text=The%20term%20Unburnable%20Carbon%20refers,carbon%20budget%20for%20that%20temperature.) the organization focuses on the risks associated with investing in fossil fuels in the context of climate change mitigation efforts. The Initiative aims to inform investors and companies about the financial implications of the global shift towards a low-carbon economy.

Analysis / Bias
Carbon Tracker focuses on communicating economic risks and opportunities related to the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Their publications offer financial insights on the impact of climate change and policy shifts. For example, the article
[“Is President Biden living up to his campaign rhetoric on climate?”](https://carbontracker.org/president-biden-on-climate/) assesses President Biden’s performance against his climate change commitments made during his campaign. While mostly neutral, some emotionally loaded language indicates a slight liberal bias, particularly its emphasis on climate change and renewable energy. Further, some expert comments contain emotionally loaded language, reflecting individual viewpoints and criticisms such as “The inability to reappoint Rick Glick as FERC chair is a major disappointment.” The cited sources, which are linked externally, are [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) and law.columbia.edu.
Similarly, another article,
[“Statement on the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement,”](https://carbontracker.org/statement-on-the-us-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement-2/) critiques the U.S. withdrawal as a leadership failure, using strong language and advocating for renewable energy, reflecting a pro-environmental stance and aligning with liberal perspectives on climate policy.
Reports like “
[PetroStates of Decline: oil and Gas Producers Face Growing Fiscal Risks as the Energy Transition Unfolds”](https://carbontracker.org/reports/petrostates-of-decline/#:~:text=,%E3%80%91) examine the financial risks that countries reliant on oil and gas production face during the shift to more sustainable energy sources. The report uses technical language and data to highlight the economic risks and cites sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They also publish blog posts like [“The Impact of West Virginia v. EPA,”](https://carbontracker.org/the-impact-of-west-virginia-v-epa/#:~:text=EPA,-Carbon%20Markets&text=On%20June%2030%2C%20the%20U.S.,lower%20power%20plant%20carbon%20emissions.) which discusses the Supreme Court ruling’s implications for climate policy, balancing factual reporting with expert opinions and some emotionally loaded language and citing sources like supremecourt.gov.
Based on the analysis of these articles and the general content published by Carbon Tracker Initiative, their publication bias leans toward left-center, characterized by their focus on climate change, advocacy for renewable energy, and critical stance toward actions that hinder environmental progress. Despite this bias, their reports and articles are grounded in financial analysis and backed by expert opinions, contributing to their high credibility in factual reporting. Including diverse perspectives in their analyses further enhances their reliability as a source of information on climate-related financial matters.
