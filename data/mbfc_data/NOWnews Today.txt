Analysis / Bias
NOWnews Today uses some loaded language in their local reports but maintains factual reporting, such as in this article:
[Lu Shaye Questions the Sovereignty of the Former Soviet Union, Ukrainian President’s Adviser Criticizes Absurdity](https://www.nownews.com/news/6119223). This story is sourced from the [Central News Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/central-news-agency-cna-focus-taiwan/).
Editorially, NOWnews Today mostly aligns with the left as evidenced by this op-ed:
[Today’s Editorial / Taiwan’s epidemic war is also a humanitarian war?](https://www.nownews.com/news/3940280) In general, story selection and op-eds favor the left, while the news is mostly factual due to some false claims.
