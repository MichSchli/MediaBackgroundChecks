Analysis / Bias
WorldGreyNews.com, also known as the Fake News Generator, publishes real news stories on their homepage from credible sources such as
[Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/). Interspersed amongst the real stories are user-generated fake news stories. The site’s primary purpose is to have people create real-looking fake news stories to share with friends on social media. Users can even include logos from [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), [Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/), and the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) to trick people further.
On Luka Stojanovic’s web developer portfolio website, he claims worldgreynews.com is a “Fake joke news creator.” He further states, “On this service, the client can publish joke news. When he creates news, he can share it with friends. Joke article is surrounded by real actual news. I created the PHP script that scrapes BBC feed, scrapes images from pages linked with feed.”
While WGN clarifies they are a fake news generator, the publication of real news makes this site deceptive and therefore Questionable. The website has even caught the attention of fact-checkers. See below.
