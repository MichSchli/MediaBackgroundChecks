Analysis / Bias
In review, the Cold Dead Hands website features a blog that publishes news about gun rights from a Libertarian/Conservative perspective. Headlines are moderately loaded and often explore what if scenarios such as this:
[Revolution 2.0: We The People vs US Government](http://www.colddeadhands.us/revolution-2-we-the-people-vs-us-government/). This story like most on the website is opinion based and does not offer hyperlinked sourcing to substantiate their claims. Editorially, there is general support for Republican President Donald Trump such as this: [Trump – American Hitler? The Left Says Yes, As Usual](http://www.colddeadhands.us/trump-american-hitler-left-says-yes-usual/) and this [Putin Is Laughing At American Dump Trumpers](http://www.colddeadhands.us/putin-laughing-american-dump-trumpers/). Finally, Cold Dead Hands published a thoughtful piece on fake news spread by the Mainstream Media ( [Mainstream Fake News Challenge)](http://www.colddeadhands.us/mainstream-fake-news-challenge/), they again do not provide hyperlinks to validate their claims. In this article they reported numerous cases of fake news such as this “Swastikas and KKK graffiti at a college campus the work of Trump supporters: FAKE.” While this may be true, we the readers, do not have any idea what incident is being referred to or how it was validated to be fake.
