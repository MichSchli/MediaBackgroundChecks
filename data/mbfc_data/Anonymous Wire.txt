History
[Launched in January 2022](https://whois.domaintools.com/anonymouswire.com), Anonymous Wire is an anonymously published news and opinion website. The website lacks transparency as it does not offer an about page or disclose ownership, authors, or location.
The only indication of where this website is based, besides poorly written English, is the Russian admin’s name
[ЛАШО199225](https://anonymouswire.com/author/admin/). However, this does not mean the site is based in Russia.
Funded by / Ownership
Anonymous Wire lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Anonymous Wire publishes a combination of credible plagiarized news and questionable/conspiracy/pseudoscience stories. For example, in this story, they copy directly from the
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/): [Georgia Senate runoff live updates – The Washington Post](https://anonymouswire.com/georgia-senate-runoff-live-updates-the-washington-post/).
While about half of the stories are real credible news from established media outlets, the others fall into the conspiracy, pseudoscience, and questionable categories. For example, they promote the debunked Clinton body bag conspiracy, such as this
[ANOTHER Clinton Associate, Who Vowed to Expose Elite Pedophile Ring, Found Dead](https://anonymouswire.com/another-clinton-associate-who-vowed-to-expose-elite-pedophile-ring-found-dead/). This story is copied from the conspiracy/fake news website [Newspunch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-punch/), which has a terrible track record with fact-checking.
When it comes to Covid-19, virtually every story is factually inaccurate such as this claiming the vaccine is toxic
[Rand Paul: “Appalling” That CDC Has Approved Toxic COVID Jabs for Children](https://anonymouswire.com/rand-paul-appalling-that-cdc-has-approved-toxic-covid-jabs-for-children/). This story is again from Newspunch. In another debunked story, from the non-credible [The Expose:](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-expose/) [Doctors Discover Graphene Is Transmitted From The COVID Vaccinated To The Unvaccinated, Destroying Blood Cells & Causing Blood Clots](https://anonymouswire.com/doctors-discover-graphene-is-transmitted-from-the-covid-vaccinated-to-the-unvaccinated-destroying-blood-cells-causing-blood-clots/). This republished story was deemed [false](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/855850d3).
Editorially, they promote conspiracies that are supported by the conservative right, such as
[The Great Reset](https://anonymouswire.com/the-great-reset-mega-companies-are-silently-and-deceptively-adding-insects-to-our-food/), [Stolen Election](https://anonymouswire.com/new-york-times-worries-that-big-tech-wont-censor-hard-enough-during-midterm-elections/), and [QAnon Pedo](https://anonymouswire.com/lara-logan-says-biden-administration-is-guilty-of-trafficking-children-for-the-elite/) conspiracies. In general, Anonymous Wire is far-right biased and promotes tin-foil hat-level conspiracies and quackery pseudoscience. This source might also be a Russian disinformation site designed to stir division in American politics.
