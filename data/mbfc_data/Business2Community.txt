Analysis / Bias
The Business 2 Community website provides balanced views of the current business landscape. Business 2 Community also publishes US and world news and does fact-checks (see controversy below). Articles and headlines contain minimally loaded emotional wording such as this
[How to Solve the Problem of Remote Collaboration in the Age of Working From Home](https://www.business2community.com/workplace-culture/how-to-solve-the-problem-of-remote-collaboration-in-the-age-of-working-from-home-02414532).
In 2018, it was revealed that the brother of founder Brian Rice, Shawn Rice, had been
[exposed in plagiarising](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2018/06/shawn-rice-buzzted-by-buzzfeed.html) the credible IFCN Fact-Checker [Lead Stories](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lead-stories/) and gaining a higher Google Rank on these stories (our experience with Google shows this is possible as a library in Wisconsin who references MBFC about our rating on the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) will rank higher than our original (ACTUAL) rating…frequently…Google is broken). But I digress; they were caught and deleted 6000 posts, according to Lead Stories.
In general, they currently report news factually and with minimal bias. Still, they have not recovered from this scandal and have limited traffic at this time due to the injuries they sustained from this corruption. Our review is focused on the current content, though.
