History
Founded in 2013, Emerging Europe is an online news website based in London, which focuses on economics, business, and politics. They also publish a
[quarterly magazine ](https://emerging-europe.com/editorial/)that focuses mostly on business issues related to Central and Eastern European countries. Emerging Europe’s [about page](https://emerging-europe.com/about/) does not mention when and who founded it and who funds it. Emerging Europe’s readership is geared toward business owners and investors. The editor-in-chief is [Craig Turp-Balazs](https://clearvoice.com/cv/@bucharestlife), however, this is not prominently displayed. Further, this website completely lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership or funding.

Funded by / Ownership
Emerging Europe does not openly disclose ownership and funding.
[Andrew Wrobel](https://emerging-europe.com/macedonian-economy/speaker/andrew-wrobel/) is the “founding partner” of Emerging Europe and they list [these companies](https://emerging-europe.com/partners/) as their partners. Revenue appears to be derived from advertising, however, there may be other sources of funding that are not disclosed.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Emerging Europe uses emotionally loaded language covering politics such as
[“A new round of US sanctions against Russia could backfire.”](https://emerging-europe.com/news/a-new-round-of-us-sanctions-against-russia-could-backfire/) A quote from the article reads “Combined with other external factors such as the change in global oil prices, the Russian economy saw a 2.8 percent drop in GDP in 2015.” However, they don’t provide links to verify the claim. In another article covering Hungarian [right-wing, populist](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/viktor-orban-hungary/557246/) Prime Minister Victor Orban, Emerging Europe appears to be neutral [“Viktor Orbán meets the press.”](https://emerging-europe.com/news/viktor-orban-meets-the-press/) They also publish opinion pieces such as [“Poland’s Law and Justice party should be banned”,](https://emerging-europe.com/voices/polands-law-and-justice-party-should-be-banned/) which is critical of Poland’s Law and Justice party (PIS) ( Poland’s right-wing populist [national conservative party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice)).
Emerging Europe covers immigrant-related news with a neutral tone such as
[“Tension rises in emerging Europe as region prepares for new wave of migrants”.](https://emerging-europe.com/news/tension-rises-in-emerging-europe-as-region-prepares-for-new-wave-of-migrants/) There is no hyperlinking in this article either. Emerging Europe covers [global warming](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) with a neutral tone such as [“Budapest’s mayor declares climate emergency.”](https://emerging-europe.com/news/budapests-mayor-declares-climate-emergency/) Further, they also advocate for left-leaning positions regarding climate change such as this: [It’s time for the EU to fully embrace the benefits of decarbonisation.](https://emerging-europe.com/intelligence/its-time-for-the-eu-to-fully-embrace-the-benefits-of-decarbonisation/)
Emerging Europe utilizes credible sources such as Freedom House and the Institute of International Finance. When covering the U.S they use strongly emotionally loaded language such as
[“Six ways the US can repair its relationship with Ukraine.”](https://emerging-europe.com/news/six-ways-the-us-can-repair-its-relationship-with-ukraine/) For example, a quote from the article reads “Despite Mr. Trump’s damaging actions, 2020 could (and should) be the year of a reinforced strategic relationship between the two countries.” Further, they frequently report negatively on former USA President Donald Trump such as this: [Donald Trump in bizarre attack on ‘aggressive’ Montenegro](https://emerging-europe.com/news/donald-trump-in-bizarre-attack-on-aggressive-montenegro/).
