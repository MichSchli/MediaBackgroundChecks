In review, the Left Action sporadically provides news that often targets former President Donald Trump, such as this:
[“Trump Sucks” FB page tops 800,000 fans](http://leftaction.com/news/%5Byyyy%5D/trump-sucks-fb-page-tops-800000-fans). This entire story appears to be the headline. This emotionally loaded headline links to a Facebook poll, which is not credible: [Poll: Which is smarter, Trump supporters or a rock](http://leftaction.com/news/%5Byyyy%5D/poll-which-smarter-trump-supporters-or-rock)? In general, this source does not provide credible information, and its purpose is unknown.
