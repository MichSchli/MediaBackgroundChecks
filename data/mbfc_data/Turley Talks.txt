Analysis / Bias
Turley Talks exhibits a strong right-leaning bias in its content, with frequent favorable coverage of
[former President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and criticism of the Democratic Party. Headlines such as “ [Democrats PANIC as Trump Surges!](https://turleytalks.com/democrats-panic-as-trump-surges/)” and “ [Woke Judge HUMILIATED as Trump Takes the Stand!](https://turleytalks.com/woke-judge-humiliated-as-trump-takes-the-stand/)” indicate a pattern of right-biased wording. The site also features content that aligns with right-wing populism and traditionalist sentiments.
The website’s articles often contain emotionally charged language that consistently favors conservative causes and personalities. For example, the site has articles with titles that claim a “
[Trump Victory INEVITABLE as DeSantis IMPLODES!](https://turleytalks.com/trump-victory-inevitable-as-desantis-implodes/)” and discuss the “ [Pro Hamas Left SPLITTING the Dems](https://turleytalks.com/the-pro-hamas-left-is-splitting-the-dems/),” which suggests a narrative that aligns with conservative and right-wing ideologies.
Finally, the website frequently promotes disinformation related to COVID-19, such as this
[Nobel Prize Awarded to Developers of Deadly Bioweapon](https://turleytalks.com/nobel-prize-awarded-to-developers-of-deadly-bioweapon/) and false claims regarding a stolen election in 2020: [Trump’s Strategy to Stop the Steal in 2024!](https://turleytalks.com/trumps-strategy-to-stop-the-steal-in-2024/) In general, Turley Talks is a far-right biased website that promotes propaganda and misinformation to further its agenda.
