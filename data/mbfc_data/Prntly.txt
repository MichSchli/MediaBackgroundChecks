Analysis / Bias
In review, Prntly does not produce original stories, but rather summarizes and links to external information. Headlines are biased such as this:
[Police Departments Refusing To Police Democrat National Convention](https://prntly.com/2020/07/29/police-departments-refusing-to-police-democrat-national-convention/). This headline is not true. This website also heavily reports favorably for Trump with articles such as these [Arrest Made In Violent Assault of 82 Year Old Man For His Trump Hat](https://prntly.com/2020/08/05/arrest-made-in-violent-assault-of-82-year-old-man-for-his-trump-hat/) and this [Black Trump Supporter MURDERED In Broad Daylight By Gunfire](https://prntly.com/2020/07/27/black-trump-supporter-murdered-in-broad-daylight-by-gunfire/). The common theme is to portray African Americans and other minorities as the source of crime.
