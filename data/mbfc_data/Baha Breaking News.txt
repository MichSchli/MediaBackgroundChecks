Analysis / Bias
Baha Breaking News generally reports statements from notable political and diplomatic figures with minimal editorial input. Their articles are typically brief in length, focusing on direct quotes and event reporting, which suggests a more neutral stance in these instances. However, a significant issue with their sourcing is the extensive use of circular referencing. Our analysis of several articles from the site reveals this pattern.
For instance, the article
[“Israeli Envoy: Our Economy Ready for Prolonged Fighting”](https://breakingthenews.net/Article/Israeli-envoy:-Our-economy-ready-for-prolonged-fighting/61158920) quotes Israeli Ambassador to Russia Alexander Ben Zvi, emphasizing Israel’s economic readiness for sustained military operations. While it references [TASS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russian-news-agency-tass/), a Russian news agency, for Ben Zvi’s comments, the absence of an external link to the original TASS report limits the ability to verify the full context of the ambassador’s statements. The article maintains a neutral tone, but the statements carry emotional weight due to the subject matter.
Another article,
[“Trump: Days of US weakness, the submission will be over,”](https://breakingthenews.net/Article/Trump:-Days-of-US-weakness-submission-will-be-over/61159191) reports on [former President Donald Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) statements at a New Hampshire rally. Trump’s remarks, which are emotionally loaded, criticize [President Joe Biden’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) energy policies and promise stronger US policies if re-elected. The article maintains a neutral tone, but its credibility is affected by a lack of external verification sources, which impacts its overall reliability.
Similarly,
[“MSC, CMA CGM halt Red Sea shipments”](https://breakingthenews.net/Article/MSC-CMA-CGM-halt-Red-Sea-shipments/61159249) discusses the suspension of Red Sea shipments by major shipping companies in response to attacks by Yemeni Houthi projectiles. The language is factual and neutral, without emotional bias. Yet, the article’s credibility is compromised by exclusive circular referencing within the same website, lacking external, independent sources for verification, which again limits the article’s overall reliability and comprehensiveness.
In general, Baha Breaking News demonstrates a pattern of neutral and direct reporting in terms of tone and content. However, the consistent issue of circular referencing and lack of external verification sources in their articles raises questions about the depth, diversity, and reliability of their reporting. This practice can lead to a narrowed perspective and limit the site’s ability to view complex issues comprehensively.
