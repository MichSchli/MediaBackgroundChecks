Analysis / Bias
GreatReject does not produce original news reporting but rather republishes or links to other articles from other sources. Story selection appeals to the far-right and those who reject the consensus of science. For example, they promote
[human-influenced climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as this [NASA admits climate change is natural and caused by the sun](https://greatreject.org/climate-change-hoax/). However, at the time of this review, the main topic is Covid-19 misinformation and falsehoods. GreatReject believes that Covid-19 is not real, as evidenced by this story [Official Covid death numbers: the fraud and the killing](https://greatreject.org/covid-death-numbers-fraud/). During the USA Presidential Election, they often promoted election fraud conspiracies, which links to a [Bitchute video](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bitchute/): [Lin Wood: “I believe the military is in control,” “Joe Biden is a fake president](https://www.bitchute.com/video/hILqkN2omI9E/).
They normally rely on misinformation websites such as
[America’s Frontline Doctors](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/americas-frontline-doctors/), [LewRockwell.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/), and [RT.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) when it comes to sourcing. Further on the right-hand sidebar, they offer links to video channels that read like a who’s who list of conspiracy theorists. Links include [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [Corbett Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-corbett-report/), [Right Side Broadcasting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right-side-broadcasting-network-rsbn/), and [OAN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/). In general, GreatReject promotes far-right biased conspiracy and pseudoscience that is not credible on any level.
Failed Fact Checks
[Government of Norway indicted for crimes against humanity](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/04/fact-check-no-indictment-against-Norwegian-government-for-crimes-against-humanity.html)– False [Three British Airways pilots have died of the Covid-19 vaccine in the last seven days.](https://fullfact.org/online/british-airways-pilot-vaccine/)– False
The sources utilized by the GreatReject have abysmal track records with fact-checkers.
