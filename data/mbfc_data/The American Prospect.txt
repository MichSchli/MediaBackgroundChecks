Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Prospect reports original political news from a liberal perspective. Stories are well written, and headlines contain moderately loaded language that favors the left, such as this:
[The Republican War on the Capital Gains Tax](https://prospect.org/article/republican-war-on-capital-gains-tax). This story is very well sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and Whitehouse.gov.
Economically, the American Prospect aligns with the progressive left with articles such as this:
[The 5 Biggest Corporate Lies About Unions](https://prospect.org/article/5-biggest-corporate-lies-about-unions). When it comes to science, they support the consensus on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), [vaccines](https://prospect.org/article/really-there-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism), and [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/).
Editorially, the American Prospect favors liberal positions; however, they present factual and evidence-based information.
