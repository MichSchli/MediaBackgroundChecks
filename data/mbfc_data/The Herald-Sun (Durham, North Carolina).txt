In review, The Herald-Sun reports local news through the use of journalists and national news via the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [McClatchy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mcclatchydc/), and other McClatchy papers such as the [Sun-Sentinel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-florida-sun-sentinel/). There is minimal use of loaded words, and all information is sourced properly.
Editorially, more commentary favors left-leaning positions and is slightly negative toward conservatives.
