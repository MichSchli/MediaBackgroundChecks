History

[about page](https://www.desantisdaily.com/about/), “DeSantis Daily’s goal is to expose the TRUTH behind the media’s lies. DeSantis Daily will keep you up-to-date on all the latest Ron DeSantis news.” The website otherwise lacks transparency as the authors are not named, the domain is registered privately, and ownership is not revealed.

Analysis / Bias
DeSantis Daily does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left, such as this:
[Democrats want to do one thing to Ron DeSantis that crossed this big red line](https://www.desantisdaily.com/democrats-want-to-do-one-thing-to-ron-desantis-that-crossed-this-big-red-line/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on the information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[A federal judge just handed Ron DeSantis a victory in his battle against the Left’s woke agenda](https://www.desantisdaily.com/a-federal-judge-just-handed-ron-desantis-a-victory-in-his-battle-against-the-lefts-woke-agenda/), and [Democrats realized they’re in trouble over the reason Kansas voters gave Ron DeSantis a standing ovation](https://www.desantisdaily.com/democrats-realized-theyre-in-trouble-over-the-reason-kansas-voters-gave-ron-desantis-a-standing-ovation/). In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing conspiracy theories and propaganda while sometimes using poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
