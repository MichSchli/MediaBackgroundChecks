Analysis / Bias
In review, Foreign Policy covers news related to foreign affairs with minimal bias. Headlines are generally free from loaded words, though at times moderate such as this:
[Bernie Sanders Still Doesn’t Pass the Commander-in-Chief Test](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/01/bernie-sanders-still-doesnt-pass-the-commander-in-chief-test/) (anti-progressive) and this [Trump Doesn’t Want to Play Peacemaker](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/05/trump-doesnt-want-to-play-peacemaker-india-pakistan-war-pulwama/) (anti-Trump). Both articles use proper sourcing.
Editorially, they are reasonably balanced and factual. In general, Foreign Policy leans slightly right in its news coverage but is balanced in reporting and well-sourced.
