History

The magazine focuses on domestic and international current events, societal commentary, and Bible-based self-help articles, which often source Biblical writing as a prophecy relating to world events. The current editor-in-chief is Gerald Flurry, the founder of the [Philadelphia Church of God](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00Ldf_hFI7zJa-nq4tCxeikP8U_-A:1615319706476&q=Philadelphia+Church+of+God&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LUz9U3MDMxNShRAjNNclLycrUsM8qt9JPzc3JSk0sy8_P084vSE_MyqxJBnPi0_NK8lNSiYisII0UBWXYRq1RARmZOYkpqTkFGZqKCc0ZpUXKGQn6agnt-yg5WRgC3A1p2cwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-_LXq_qPvAhXCct8KHRPRBZUQmxMoATAhegQIHhAD).

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Trumpet website publishes podcasts as well as original news summaries and commentary. Articles and headlines favor a right-leaning perspective and utilize loaded emotional language such as this
[Coronavirus Crackdowns Contaminate European Democracy](https://www.thetrumpet.com/23683-coronavirus-crackdowns-contaminate-european-democracy). This story is properly sourced from credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). The website also features a headlines section that curates news from other sources. Some sources are credible, while most are either [right-biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right/) or [questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/), such as [The Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/), [Just The News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), [Mises](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/), and [Red State](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/).
When not promoting right-wing politics, they publish articles connecting world events to prophecy, such as:
[Is America’s Supreme Court in Bible Prophecy?](https://www.thetrumpet.com/17949-is-americas-supreme-court-in-bible-prophecy) While this article is almost indecipherable with rhetoric and desperate attempts to connect the bible to the Supreme Court, they did fail with this quote “I believe Mr. Kavanaugh’s confirmation indicates God will likely see that President Trump has a second term.” This did not come true.
Further, the website promotes
[climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) as well as opposition to gay marriage and [conspiratorial quotes](https://www.thetrumpet.com/20902-has-the-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transsexual-agenda-worked) such as this “The ascent of the LGBT movement from being illegal to a source of “pride” brings up the question: How long until other illegal ideas, such as pedophilia, are also legalized, protected and even encouraged, and at what cost to society?” In general, The Trumpet publishes right-biased news and information that attempts to connect current events to Biblical Prophecy, which would be considered pseudoscience.
