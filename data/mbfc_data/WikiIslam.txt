History
WikiIslam was founded in 2006 by
[Ali Sina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Sina_(activist)) and [Faith Freedom International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Freedom_International). Essentially, WikiIslam was a blatant anti-Islam wiki before 2018. In 2018, they reported, “As of late 2018, [Ex-Muslims of North America](https://exmuslims.org/) initiated an overhaul of WikiIslam, with the stated goal of setting a high criteria of objectivity, neutrality, and professionalism. The mission statement and new policy and writing guidelines were added, while many articles on the site were removed, including satirical and polemical content, ex-Muslim testimonies, as well as op-eds and personal essays. Article templates, hubs, the main website categorization system, and the front page were also heavily modified.” [In March of 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiIslam), WikiIslam announced the “re-launch” of the website following extensive renovations. Thousands of pages were removed, hundreds were renovated, and new content was added. The website also added new policies to restrict objectionable speech and focus on scholarly and objective information about the religion of Islam.

Analysis / Bias
The publisher of WikiIslam is a secular group that encourages people to leave Islam. They state their
[purpose](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/WikiIslam:Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_is_the_purpose_of_WikiIslam.3F) is to “provide accurate and accessible information from traditional and critical perspectives on the beliefs, practices, and development of Islam.” They further indicate that “WikiIslam’s focus on the criticism of Islam does not make it unreliable.”
We rated them a questionable anti-Islam site in a previous review. Since our last review, they have cleaned up the website removing the overtly hostile content toward Islam. At the time of this review, they continue to focus on the negative aspects of Islam, such as this
[Wife Beating in the Qur’an](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Wife_Beating_in_the_Qur%27an). While this paints Islam negatively to a western audience, it is sourced directly from Verse 4:34 of the Quran. A review of dozens of content areas reveals most information focuses on negative aspects of Islam, such as this [Scientific Errors in the Quran.](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Quran) Again they source directly from the Quran.
Although WikiIslam is edited by those, who do not favor Islam, the information is usually derived from the texts themselves and not third-party interpretations, which is a significant change from our previous review in 2018. In general, WikiIslam publishes fact-based information that is one-sided, resulting in anti-Islamic propaganda.
