Analysis / Bias
In review, APM Reports publishes news with minimal bias using credible .gov sources such as
[www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov) and minimally loaded headlines: [” Elaine Chao, champion of Trump’s infrastructure plan, chose to keep stock in a building company.”](https://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/09/29/elaine-chao-vulcan-stock) Story selection tends to favor the left, with topics such as poverty and inequality highlighted on the website. They generally hold a left-leaning editorial bias and report news factually.
