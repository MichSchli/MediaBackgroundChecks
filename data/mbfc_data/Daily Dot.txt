Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Dot mostly covers technology news but also covers culture and politics. For this review, we will focus on politics. The Daily Dot, at worst, uses moderately loaded language in headlines, with most being minimal such as this:
[MAGA bomber sentenced to 20 years in prison](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/cesar-sayoc-magabomber-20-years/). This story is appropriately sourced. When reporting on President Trump, the Daily Dot does not have a favorable view, with articles like this: [WTF was Donald Trump doing with his hand at last night’s rally?](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/trump-jack-off-rally/) And this: [The latest terrifying deepfake combines Donald Trump and Mr. Bean](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/mr-bean-donald-trump-deepfake-video/). This story is also appropriately sourced to credible left-leaning sources such as [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/) and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
When it comes to science, they support the consensus across the board, such as this on
[GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/): [Nobel laureates urge Greenpeace to drop its crusade against GMOs](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/nobel-laureates-greenpeace-gmos-golden-rice/). In general, the Daily Dot holds a strong left-leaning editorial position while reporting news factually and with evidence.
