Analysis / Bias
In review, the Lancaster Courier does not conduct original reporting but rather summarizes news stories and adds commentary from a left-leaning perspective. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded wording such as this
[TERRIFIED TRUMP WHINED HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH WHILE HOSPITALIZED AT WALTER REED: REPORT](https://www.lancastercourier.com/2020/10/10/terrified-trump-whined-he-was-on-the-verge-of-death-while-hospitalized-at-walter-reed-report/). This story is appropriately sourced to [New York Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-magazine/). For the most part, stories are sourced to credible media outlets such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/); however, some stories such as this [TRUMP FEARMONGERS ABOUT DEMOCRATS POSSIBLY PACKING THE SUPREME COURT](https://www.lancastercourier.com/2020/10/11/trump-fearmongers-about-democrats-possibly-packing-the-supreme-court/) are not sourced at all.
Editorially, all stories favor the left and frequently denigrate conservatives, such as this
[BOB DOLE EMBARRASSES HIMSELF AND FORFEITS WHATEVER CREDIBILITY HE HAD LEFT DEFENDING TRUMP](https://www.lancastercourier.com/2020/10/10/bob-dole-embarrasses-himself-and-forfeits-whatever-credibility-he-had-left-defending-trump/). Further, the Lancaster Courier lacks transparency as they also do not disclose their liberal political leanings. The Lancaster Courier generally publishes fact-based information with a strong left-leaning bias. However, this website lacks transparency, sometimes does not source information, and uses a deceptive name to appear to be a legitimate local newspaper.
