History
Launched in June 2021, GB News is a conservative-leaning TV News station based in the United Kingdom. They set up the station to compete with News Corp-owned
[Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/) and model the popular USA-based [Fox News Channel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/). The website offers an [editorial charter](https://www.gbnews.uk/our-editorial-charter), lacking transparency as they do not disclose their conservative bias. GB News also lacks transparency as they do not indicate ownership.
Upon launching the station, some advertisers such as IKEA pulled ads due to GB News not upholding “humanistic values.” Many other advertisers joined the boycott, which can be seen

Funded by / Ownership
GB News lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership. A search reveals that London-based
[ALL Perspectives Ltd](https://suite.endole.co.uk/insight/company/12227760-all-perspectives-ltd) owns GB News. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-media/new-tv-channel-seals-funding-to-challenge-british-media-consensus-idUSKBN29B27M), the television channel “secured millions of dollars from investors such as Discovery Inc, Legatum and hedge fund manager Paul Marshall. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
GB News features significant opinion programming from a right-leaning perspective. Notable commentators are former leader of the conservative United Kingdom Independence Party Nigel Farage, former Brexit Party member Alexandra Phillips and former editor of
[The Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-sun/) newspaper Dan Wooten. The website features news reporting that uses moderately loaded language but is reasonably balanced such as this [The Prime Minister admitted he has known about the UK haulage problems for months](https://www.gbnews.uk/news/boris-johnson-indicates-shortages-could-continue-to-christmas/135703). This story is sourced correctly through direct quotes, while other stories are sourced through hyperlinks to usually credible sources such as the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/).
Editorially, the news is reported with reasonable balance; however, we calculated that more stories favor the right such as this
[‘Previous generations of Labour leaders, activists and voters would look in dismay at what Labour has become,’ says Oliver Dowden](https://www.gbnews.uk/news/labour-have-woke-running-through-it-like-a-stick-of-brighton-rock-says-tory-party-chairman/135830). The website features opinion pieces under the “GB Views” tag, demonstrating significant right-leaning bias.
Many opinion stories oppose cancel culture and are often critical of the so-called “woke” movement
[Nana Akua on ‘ridiculous’ number of gender pronouns](https://www.gbnews.uk/gb-views/nana-akua-on-ridiculous-number-of-gender-pronouns/136051). Op-eds also display negative views toward immigration, such as this [Patrick Christys: There’s a magic money tree for illegal immigration, but not for social care](https://www.gbnews.uk/gb-views/patrick-christys-theres-a-magic-money-tree-for-illegal-immigration-but-not-for-social-care/124742). Finally, they frequently make false and misleading claims regarding Covid-19 and vaccines; see failed fact checks below. In general, GB News reports news mixed factually, while editorial views align strongly with the right.
