[right-leaning opinion](https://www.tnonline.com/20211220/opinion-a-new-birth-of-freedom-takes-on-cancel-culture/) piece, they criticize cancel culture. In contrast, they criticize the [“Big Lie”](https://www.tnonline.com/20220104/opinion-dangerous-state-legislator-now-wants-to-be-our-governor/) that former President Trump lost the election due to election fraud. In general, more op-eds favor the right.
