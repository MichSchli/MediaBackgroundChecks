Analysis / Bias
In review, The Sydney Morning Herald covers news within the Sydney area through journalists and with minimally loaded language such as this:
[Strong winds fanning out-of-control NSW bushfires expected to continue](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/more-property-loss-predicted-as-strengthening-winds-fan-nsw-bushfires-20190909-p52pba.html). This story is appropriately sourced to video and first-person accounting. World News is also covered via original writing from journalists such as this: [Senior judge admonishes Johnson over no-deal Brexit ‘loophole’ ploy](https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/senior-judge-admonishes-johnson-over-no-deal-brexit-loophole-ploy-20190909-p52plm.html). The paper also features a section dedicated to politics that maintains a reasonable centrist tone: [Federal MPs rally behind Hong Kong protests in push back against China](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/federal-mps-rally-behind-hong-kong-protests-in-push-back-against-china-20190909-p52pli.html).
Editorially, the SMH has a long history of endorsing various candidates from both the left and right. However, recently in 2007 and 2010, they
[endorsed](http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/the-more-they-stay-the-same-8230/2007/11/23/1195753304670.html) the Center-Left Labor party, and in 2016, they [endorsed](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/smh-editorial/donald-trump-should-quit-presidential-race-20161009-gryhw1.html) USA Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Finally, in 2019 they [endorsed](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/17/nt-news-breaks-ranks-as-only-news-corp-paper-to-endorse-bill-shorten) Bill Shorten of the Labor Party. Further, the editorial page tends to lean left with op-eds supporting [gender equality](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/the-ugly-statistical-truth-about-the-lack-of-women-leaders-in-australia-20190909-p52piw.html) and [opposing drug testing for welfare recipients](https://www.smh.com.au/national/don-t-humiliate-newstart-applicants-with-drug-test-it-s-no-way-to-tackle-addiction-20190906-p52osf.html). In general, SMH reports news factually and with minimal bias, while editorial positions lean slightly left.
Finally, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 53% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 17% do not, ranking them #9 in trust of the major Australian news providers.
