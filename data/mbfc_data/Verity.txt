Analysis / Bias
Verity offers a comprehensive news experience. Articles labeled “story” provide detailed analysis, while others offer summaries with links to the original content. To create a story page, the editorial team utilizes machine learning to aggregate articles on the same event, extracting key facts that all sources agree on and the main narratives where opinions diverge.
The website features a customizable interface where readers can adjust news bias and writing style preferences through an
[accessible slider menu.](https://www.improvethenews.org/preferences#slider_preferences) Preferences set here refine the news feed, which can be further adjusted on the fly using the slider icon on the homepage, ensuring content stays aligned with reader interests.
In review, Verity’s Politics section presents news in a format that blends summaries with direct links to sources. Some articles are labeled “stories,” offering more in-depth narratives on specific topics. Other news items, such as reports on Kim Jong Un or Joe Biden’s approval ratings, feature concise overviews with links to external sites like
[Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/) or [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) for full details.
For example, we analyzed the page featuring a report labeled as “story” titled
[“Report: Big Pharma to Start 2024 With Price Hikes,”](https://www.improvethenews.org/story/2023/report-big-pharma-to-start-with-price-hikes) The report structures information under ‘Facts,’ where key details that various sources agree on. Below this, it lists sources such as [Yahoo Finance](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), and [The White House](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), providing an objective baseline of the report. It is followed by various narratives or ‘spins,’ including establishment-critical, pro-establishment, cynical, and nerd narratives. Each narrative is supported by articles from different sources, offering diverse views on the issue. This structure allows readers to understand the story from multiple angles, enhancing their comprehension of the news.
Further, Verity allows readers to customize their news content based on their political and establishment bias as well as the writing style of the news content they wish to view. Users can adjust these preferences by clicking “How our sliders work,” which is located towards the bottom of the homepage. It’s placed under the main news content and above the footer. Options include showing newspaper flags and stances and enabling info popups for a more informed reading experience. After setting their
[Preferences](https://www.improvethenews.org/preferences#slider_preferences) in the slider menu, users can save them to curate their news feed to match their desired level of depth and perspective.
In general, Verity exhibits minimal bias by providing news stories from multiple angles allowing the reader to decide which they prefer. Unlike similar sources that aggregate content based on Bias, they
[curate stories](https://www.improvethenews.org/about) to ensure only the facts are presented, indicating they are fact-based in reporting. Although they may rely on sources that have been deemed questionable or mixed for factual reporting, they extract the facts from these sources to ensure accuracy.
