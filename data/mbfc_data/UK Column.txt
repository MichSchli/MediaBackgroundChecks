Analysis / Bias
In review, UK Column uses loaded language both in their headlines and articles such as: ”
[Cameron and Obama’s Hired Thugs Now Butchering Their Way Through Syria.](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/cameron-and-obama%E2%80%99s-hired-thugs-now-butchering-their-way-through-syria)” This article, like many on the website, does not link to a single source. However, they sometimes utilize credible sources such as the [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), gov.uk and questionable sources such as the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) and conspiracy sites such as [21st Century Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/21st-century-wire/): [“White Helmets.”](https://www.ukcolumn.org/series/white-helmets) When covering USA politics, the UK Column favors [Donald Trump and his policies](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/donald-first-minister). They also promote conspiracy theories such as the [New World Order](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/new-world-order-emerging), [False Flag Operations](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/more-israeli-false-flag-terrorism), and [World War 3](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/joel-skousen-globalists-are-setting-us-failure-world-war-3). While the UK Column does produce credible, well-sourced news, they also promote conspiracy theories.
During the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, they frequently published misinformation such as
[Lockdown Deaths, Not Covid Deaths](https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/lockdown-deaths-not-covid-deaths). In this article, they state, “COVID-19 has been circulating for at least a year, and yet there was no notable increase in unseasonable mortality anywhere until Lockdown regimes were imposed between late February and late March 2020.” This statement is false as lockdowns have [saved numerous lives](https://www-bbc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-52968523). They have also [promoted](https://www.ukcolumn.org/blogs/not-led-by-science) anti-mask propaganda with this statement, “Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever. Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue signaling. They’re not even worn most of the time effectively.” [This also is not true](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/). In general, the UK Column is not a credible source of information that routinely publishes right-wing conspiracy theories.
