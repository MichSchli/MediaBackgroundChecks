Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Star is a tabloid that usually publishes entertainment and lifestyle-type stories. They do not often report on politics; however, when they do, they use loaded sensational wording such as this:
[Lags ‘chant f*** Boris’ as Prime Minister is ‘ushered away from prison visit](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/lags-chant-f-boris-prime-18943375).’ Other political stories are not favorable toward US President Donald Trump, such as this: [‘Beginning of the END OF DAYS’ Biblical prophet predicts Trump bringing return of MESSIAH](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/israel-jerusalem-embassy-donald-trump-17139035). This conspiratorial article does not offer hyperlinked sourcing. Most reports do not provide proper sourcing, though many contain videos.
Editorially, the Daily Star
[does not endorse candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorsements_in_the_2017_United_Kingdom_general_election), though they often report negatively on Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson in reviewing their political news. However, they generally favor right-leaning positions such as reporting negatively on the EU and [supporting Brexit](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-05-23-uk-newspapers-positions-brexit). In general, the Daily Star is Right-Center biased editorially.
The Daily Star has a long track record of publishing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and pseudoscience such as these:
