Analysis / Bias
In review, The Palestine Chronicle reports on news regarding Palestine and the conflict with Israel. The Palestine Chronicle frequently uses highly emotional language such as:
[Stopping War Pusher John Bolton, Trump’s Choice for National ‘Insecurity’ Adviser](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/stopping-war-pusher-john-bolton-trumps-choice-national-insecurity-adviser/). Usually, they source all information from credible media sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they report one-sided in favor of Palestine in the conflict with Israel. This sometimes leads to speculative reporting, such as in the story
[Who Bombed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital: Three Investigations Offer Answers](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/who-bombed-al-ahli-baptist-hospital-three-top-investigations-offer-an-answer/). This article appears to be misleading because it presents multiple investigations that challenge the Israeli army’s claims but does not offer definitive, official confirmation to substantiate its claims that Israel bombed the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza. The article leans towards implicating Israel without conclusive evidence, thereby potentially leading readers to draw premature conclusions.
In general, all story selection favors Palestine with negative reporting toward Israel. Further, although they have not officially failed a fact check, there is evidence of one-sided reporting and opinions that can be misleading.
