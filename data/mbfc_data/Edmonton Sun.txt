Funded by / Ownership
The Edmonton Sun is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his involvement in hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the
[National Observer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-observer-canada/), PostMedia is in a [downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

The Edmonston Sun is subscription-based, and revenue is primarily derived from print and digital advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Edmonton Sun reports local news from journalists in the field and national/international news via the right-leaning
[National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/) and the least biased [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). All information tends to be properly sourced to credible media. Editorially, there is a right-leaning bias in story selection. For example, many editorials are opposed to Justin Trudeau. A sample editorial reads like this: [Bell: Will Trudeau shaft Alberta — again](https://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/bell-will-trudeau-shaft-alberta-again)? In general, the news is reported factually and with a moderate conservative bias.
