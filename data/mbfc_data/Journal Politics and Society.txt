History
[Founded in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Politics_%26_Society), The Journal of Politics & Society is an academic journal of the social sciences published twice a year by the Helvidius Group, a nonprofit student organization at Columbia University. According to their [about page,](http://www.helvidius.org/) “the Journal only considers academic papers submitted by undergraduates. In a process comparable to the peer review and editing procedures of professional academic journals, selected papers are rigorously edited by the Editorial Board, composed exclusively of undergraduates.”
They further report their past contributors to consist of “former President Bill Clinton, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former New Jersey Governor and EPA Administrator Christie Todd Whitman, former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Senator Elizabeth Dole, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn, Human Rights Watch President Kenneth Roth, Anthony Marx, and Kenneth Waltz.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Journal of Politics & Society publishes researched political journal articles that use minimally loaded language and are always very well-sourced. Topic selection tends to slightly favor the left when dealing with social issues. Issues are published in PDF format and written for a high-level reader. For example, the story “
[DO CULTURAL VALUES AFFECT THE DECISION TO EMIGRATE?](http://www.helvidius.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JPS_Fall_2019.pdf) THE CASE OF LITHUANIA” offers 137 source citations. In general, this is a highly factual source that leans slightly left on social issues.
