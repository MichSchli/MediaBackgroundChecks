History
Project 2025 is an
[initiative](https://www.project2025.org/about/about-project-2025/) organized by [The Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/), aiming to prepare for a conservative victory in the 2025 presidential transition. It emphasizes the importance of policy, personnel, and training to undo the perceived damage done by liberal politicians and establish a conservative administration.
The project is based on four pillars: a policy agenda, a personnel database, training, and a 180-day playbook. Key figures include Paul Dans, former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management during the Trump administration, and Spencer Chretien, former special assistant to the president.

Funded by / Ownership
The website does not explicitly state its funding sources, but it is organized by The Heritage Foundation, a well-known conservative think-tank. This connection suggests that Project 2025 is likely funded and supported by The Heritage Foundation and its network.
[Over 90 conservative organizations](https://www.project2025.org/about/advisory-board/) form a broad coalition supporting this project, such as [ALEC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-legislative-exchange-council-alec/), [Competitive Enterprise Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/competitive-enterprise-institute/), [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/), and [Moms for Liberty](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/moms-for-liberty-bias/).
Analysis / Bias
Project 2025 is a political advocacy organization that exhibits a pronounced conservative bias in its content and objectives. This is particularly evident in the
[“Policy”](https://www.project2025.org/policy/) and [“Playbook”](https://www.project2025.org/playbook/) sections of their website.
The “Policy” section, contributed to by over 400 conservative scholars, former officials, and policy experts, clearly articulates a conservative policy agenda aimed at deconstructing the Administrative State and preparing for a conservative administration. This section lacks political neutrality, overtly targeting conservative readers and actions.
Similarly, the “Playbook” section outlines a strategic plan for the first 180 days of a conservative administration, further demonstrating the right-wing political alignment of the project. While these sections are
[ideologically driven](https://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf), they do not overtly promote conspiracy theories or pseudoscience, although they present climate change skepticism in their policies throughout the document.
While there are hundreds of proposals throughout the 900+ page document, we will highlight the key policy initiatives supported by Project 2025:
- Immigration and Border Security: Proposals include permitting programs similar to the Prompt Asylum Claim Review and Humanitarian Asylum Review Process, reasserting control of employment authorization, permanently authorizing and mandating E-Verify, and authorizing state and local law enforcement to participate in immigration and border security actions.
- Education and Student Loans: Proposals include overhauling the federal student loan program with options like privatizing all lending programs, treating taxpayers like investors in federal student aid, safeguarding civil rights by rejecting gender ideology and critical race theory, and amending FERPA and PPRA to provide parents and students with a private right of action against violations.
- Process Policy and Addressing China: Suggestions include re-establishing in-person pandemic-related verifications, especially regarding China, implementing advanced analytics and AI for system integrity, and working with Customs and Border Protection to address circumvention and duty evasion.
- Employment Authorization and Executive Orders: Proposals include transforming the H-1B visa program to attract the “best and brightest” and ensuring that U.S. workers are not disadvantaged, along with regulatory actions to limit classes of aliens eligible for work authorization.
- Asylum and Parole Reform: Suggested reforms include raising the standard for a credible fear of persecution, codifying former asylum bars, and reforming parole to limit its use.
- Justice Department Review and Regulation: Proposals include ending politically motivated prosecutions, terminating outdated consent decrees, and enacting policies to prohibit settlement payments to third parties.
- Educational Accreditation and Transparency: The document recommends expanding the list of allowable accreditors and issuing executive orders for transparency around federal programs and grants, and reports on school safety and department consolidation.
- Investigation into the Origins of COVID-19: A proposal to establish a presidential commission or congressional committee to investigate the origins of COVID-19 and its economic and human costs and explore means of collecting damages from China.
- Reforming the Office of Federal Student Aid: Proposals include ending the abuse of loan forgiveness programs and commencing rulemaking to rescind or modify previous administration’s regulations.
- Department of Energy Loan Programs: Suggested policies include strengthening due diligence, increasing transparency, and limiting the use of new loan authority to specific projects.
- Parental Rights in Education: Proposals include prioritizing legislation that advances parental rights in education and issuing reports on the influence of certain educational approaches and expenditures.
- Counter-China Initiatives at USAID: The document recommends restoring and building on counter-China infrastructure at USAID, assessing bilateral aid through a U.S. national security lens, and financing programs to counter Chinese efforts in strategically important countries.
In general, Project 2025 simply advocates for policy changes with a hypothetical new conservative administration. However, the website also publishes news stories from conservative and conspiracy sources like
[Bannon’s War Room](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/war-room-steve-bannon-bias/) and credible sources that fit its agenda. The organization holds a strong conservative bias and may not always be factual based on its reliance on poor sources and affiliation with groups that promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
