Analysis / Bias
In review, The Last Refuge (Conservative Treehouse) reports news with a strong conservative bias, with all stories favoring the right and denigrating the left. There is considerable use of loaded language in headlines like
[Sketchy Business: Grassley Releases Original Ford Letter to Feinstein…](https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/09/23/sketchy-business-grassley-releases-original-ford-letter-to-feinstein/) Although this article is written well and utilizes sourcing, it ends in big, bold letters LIES!, conveying strong support for Judge Kavanaugh without evidence. They also list a blogroll of favorite/similar media sources that come straight from our right bias and questionable sources list. Here are a few examples: [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) (questionable), [Geller Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geller-report/) (questionable), [Jihad Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jihad-watch/) (questionable), and [Truth Revolt](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-revolt/) (questionable). In general, the Conservative TreeHouse promotes strongly right-biased propaganda and is often not factual.
