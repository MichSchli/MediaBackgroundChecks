Analysis / Bias
Israel365news.com reports news on Israel and the Middle East from an Israeli Biblical perspective. Articles and headlines contain emotionally loaded wording such as this
[‘THE LOS ANGELES TIMES’ AND ITS ABSURD ABU AKLEH CONSPIRACY THEORY](https://www.israel365news.com/270539/the-los-angeles-times-and-its-absurd-abu-akleh-conspiracy-theory-opinion/). When it comes to sourcing information, they sometimes do not provide hyperlinks, such as in this supposed scientific article [ISRAELI PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHERS TEST HOW BRAIN RESPONDS TO EMOTIONS THAT DEVIATE FROM SOCIAL NORMS](https://www.israel365news.com/270549/israeli-psychology-researchers-test-how-brain-responds-to-emotions-that-deviate-from-social-norms/).
Editorially, all opinion pieces support Israel and a conservative perspective. Many op-eds are opposed to the left with articles such as this
[CANCEL CULTURE ISN’T JUST FOR ACADEMICS ANYMORE](https://www.israel365news.com/270337/cancel-culture-isnt-just-for-academics-anymore-opinion/) and [KNESSET MEMBER WARNS: BIDEN VISITING ISRAEL TO MEDDLE IN ELECTIONS](https://www.israel365news.com/270542/knesset-member-warns-biden-visiting-israel-to-meddle-in-elections/). This article is rife with conspiracy theories, such as in this quote “Maoz’s warning is firmly based on past experiences, as meddling in Israeli politics is a tradition in the Democratic party.”
The website also promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy related to Covid-19
[ISRAELI STUDY LINKS COVID VACCINES TO 25% INCREASE IN CARDIAC ARREST](https://www.israel365news.com/269952/israeli-study-links-covid-vaccines-to-25-increase-in-cardiac-arrest/). Further, they promote [Christian Zionism](https://www.israel365news.com/category/christian-zionism/) and often use the Bible as a source of factual information. In general, Israel365 News is a moderate conspiracy and pseudoscience website with a strong conservative bias that promotes Israeli Government propaganda.
