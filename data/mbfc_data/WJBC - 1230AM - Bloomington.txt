Analysis / Bias
WJBC – 1230AM – Bloomington publishes local news stories that utilize minimally loaded language, such as this:
[Chenoa officer involved in crash near Towanda.](https://www.wjbc.com/2023/08/29/chenoa-officer-involved-in-crash-near-towanda/) This story, like all other local stories, did not provide hyperlinked sourcing to the information.
The radio station and website broadcasts a daily lineup of news radio hosts and shows that generally hold moderate conservative perspectives.
Editorially, the majority of radio hosts hold moderate conservative viewpoints. While they do not publish op-eds, political news reporting is low biased, such as this
[Illinois Republican react to conviction of Tim Mapes](https://www.wjbc.com/2023/08/25/illinois-republican-react-to-conviction-of-tim-mapes/). Again, this story lacks hyperlinks to credible sources. In general, WJBC -1230AM – Bloomington holds slightly right-leaning biases and is mostly fact-based.
