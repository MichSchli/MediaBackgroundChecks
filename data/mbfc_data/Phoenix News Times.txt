Analysis / Bias
In review, Phoenix New Times reports news with minimal bias using credible media sources such as
[Indianapolis Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/indianapolis-star/), [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), and [Guttmacher Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/alan-guttmacher-institute/). However, they do use left leaning loaded language both in their headlines and articles when discussing social issues, such as “ [Birth-Control Advocates: Trump’s Policy Restricts Women, Not Religion”](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/birth-control-advocates-trump-policy-hurts-women-religion-9767805) and “ [Healing the Wounds of Transgender Wars at the VA Hospital in Tucson.](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/transgender-veterans-cope-with-help-from-va-hospital-9747269)
