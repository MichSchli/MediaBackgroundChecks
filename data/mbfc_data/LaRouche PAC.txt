History
The
[LaRouche PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaRouche_movement) is loosely based on the LaRouche movement, which is a political and cultural network promoting Lyndon LaRouche and his ideas. The LaRouche movement used to be considered a left-wing group. However, since the 1970’s, it has moved to the right and is currently anti-climate change calling for support for [Green Fascism](https://indypendent.org/2019/09/green-fascism-a-far-right-ecology-movement-is-on-the-rise-in-germany-and-its-spreading-here/). It also promotes fear of world war 3 through videos and questionable news.
The LaRouche movement is seen as a fringe political cult. In the summer of 2009, LaRouche’s followers came under criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for comparing President Barack Obama to Hitler. Media figures as politically diverse as
[Rush Limbaugh](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/) and Jon Stewart criticized the comparison. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
