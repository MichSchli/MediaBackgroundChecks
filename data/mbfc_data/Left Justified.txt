Analysis / Bias
In review, Left Justified does not produce original news reporting but rather summarizes or provides commentary on existing news stories. Articles and headlines favor the left and sometimes contain moderately loaded emotional wording such as this
[Texas Pols on the Hot Seat as State Warms Up](http://www.leftjustified.com/texas-pols-on-the-hot-seat-as-state-warms-up/). This story, like most, is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Texas Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/texas-tribune/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, most stories favor the left but do not overtly denigrate the right. In general, the news is reported mostly factually, however, there is a lack of transparency, which reduces their factual rating to Mixed.
