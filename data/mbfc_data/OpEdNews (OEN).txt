Analysis / Bias
In review, because each individual author is wholly responsible for the content she or he submits, veracity varies with the individual writer, and it’s entirely up to readers to assess journalistic quality and bias. There is no firewall between biased opinions and well-sourced analytical reporting. Volunteer editors moderate the posts for bad taste and seek to discourage libelous and slanderous content. Posts the editors like get headlined on the front page. Frequent contributors may earn the trust of the publisher and bypass editor pre-screening to post directly. Spirited and thought-provoking discussions often follow articles as comments. In general, the news is factual and left-leaning; however, sometimes information is unsourced.
