Analysis / Bias
The Arizona Mirror(AzMirror) publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Arizona. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects Arizonians. Articles and headlines promote liberal perspectives through minimally loaded language
[“Arizona leaders join others at White House for forum on federal funds” ](https://www.azmirror.com/2022/10/10/arizona-leaders-join-others-at-white-house-for-forum-on-federal-funds/)They properly source, linking to the Arizona Legislature and credible sources such as [whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) sister publications Colorado Newsline, Kansas Reflector, [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), Rutgers.edu, Marist National, and bls.gov (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)
Editorially, opinion pieces favor the left, such as this “
[The battle for control of Congress: Abortion, inflation, crime, and Biden](https://www.azmirror.com/2022/10/10/the-battle-for-control-of-congress-abortion-inflation-crime-and-biden/).” A quote from the article reads, “GOP candidates are attempting to tie Democrats to inflation, crime, fears about immigration, and an unpopular president. But they’re shying away from talking about a national abortion ban.”
On the issues, the Arizona Mirror promotes LGBT equality,
[“Anti-LGBTQ’ hatred bills’ are dangerous to Arizonans — and bad for business.”](https://www.azmirror.com/2022/02/08/anti-lgbtq-hatred-bills-are-dangerous-to-arizonans-and-bad-for-business/) Finally, they frequently report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [“Paul Gosar promoted appearing at a white nationalist social gathering on Hitler’s birthday, but his campaign says he isn’t”](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/paul-gosar-to-attend-white-nationalist-social-gathering-on-hitlers-birthday/) and [“What was good for David Schweikert in the time of Trump might not be after redistricting”](https://www.azmirror.com/2021/12/03/what-was-good-for-david-schweikert-in-the-time-of-trump-might-not-be-after-redistricting/) In general, the Arizona Mirror reports news factually; however, story selection and op-eds strongly favor a liberal perspective.
