Analysis / Bias
The stories on FFD run the gamut from factual and moderate, such as the article regarding Philadelphia’s
[lawsuit](http://firstinfreedomdaily.com/philadelphia-sues-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-effort-end-sanctuary-cities/) against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to extreme right-wing in nature, such as the [story](http://firstinfreedomdaily.com/sit-planned-protest-liberal-charlotte-officials-ridiculous-call-city-shun-trump-supporters/) regarding Charlotte City Councilwoman Dimple Ajmera. There are no bylines for the stories on FFD other than “THE WIRE,” which appears to be a collection of right-wing articles from various sources.
Stories published via “The Wire” often contain loaded emotional language that favors the right such as this
[NC Legislature Passes Anti-Woke Indoctrination Bill](https://firstinfreedomdaily.com/nc-legislature-passes-anti-woke-indoctrination-bill/). Stories published by FFD are also emotional such as this [WATCH: Wimpy State Senator Attempts to Smear Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson/FACTS Task Force, Gets SMACKED DOWN](https://firstinfreedomdaily.com/watch-wimpy-state-senator-attempts-to-smear-lt-gov-mark-robinson-facts-task-force-gets-smacked-down/). While FFD did not directly state there was election fraud in the 2020 presidential election, they did share stories by those who promoted baseless conspiracy theories such as this [WATCH: Attorney Sidney Powell Tells Lou Dobbs ‘We Have Staggering Statistical Evidence’ Showing Electoral Fraud with Corrupt Election Software](https://firstinfreedomdaily.com/watch-attorney-sidney-powell-tells-lou-dobbs-we-have-staggering-statistical-evidence-showing-electoral-fraud-with-corrupt-election-software/). In general, FFD promotes a right-wing narrative that is not always factual.
