History
According to their
[about page](https://www.resilience.org/about-resilience/) “Resilience.org aims to support building community resilience in a world of multiple emerging challenges: the decline of cheap energy, the depletion of critical resources like water, complex environmental crises like [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and biodiversity loss, and the social and economic issues which are linked to these.” They are affiliated with the [Post Carbon Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Carbon_Institute), which is a “think tank that provides information and analysis on climate change, energy scarcity, and other issues related to sustainability and long term social resilience.” Post Carbon Institute was founded by [Julian Darley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Darley) (President) and Celine Rich (Executive Director) in 2003.

Analysis / Bias
Resilience mostly republishes environmental news stories from other sources, as well as a few original stories. Republished stories come from a wide variety of
[known media sources](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-07-17/the-trump-era-wont-last-for-ever-but-we-must-do-our-part-to-end-it/) to [obscure blogs](http://theclimatelemon.com/government-kill-rooftop-solar/) that have not been checked for factual reporting. While Resilience occasionally reports on news from a right-leaning perspective, almost all come from the left, with the general theme of striving for the Post Carbon Institute’s goal of a 100% reduction of carbon dioxide. Resilience also publishes an occasional political article that typically favors the left, such as this: [Between Trump and a Devastated Place.](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-04-25/between-trump-and-a-devastated-place/)
The Resilience
[also reports on GMO’s](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2016-07-24/are-you-anti-science-if-you-don-t-like-gmos/) and rejects the notion that they will provide food sustainability in the future and [questions their safety](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), which is opposed to the current consensus of science.
