Analysis / Bias
While there are a few credible bits of information on this website, most falls within the realm of pseudoscience. There are articles about
[oils](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-essential-oils/) and [herbs](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/teenager-dying-of-cancer-try-cannabis/) that [create magical cures](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/oil-can-cure-migraines-depression-anxiety/) and promote the idea of [Alien mega-structures](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/nasas-kepler-telescope-discovered-an-artificial-megastructure-built-by-an-advanced-alien-civilization/) being found in space. Many stories focus on pseudosciences such as [astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/), which has zero groundings in science or evidence.
In another story,
[Strong Immunity and Health is the Key to Beating Coronavirus](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/strong-immunity-and-health-is-the-key-to-beating-coronavirus/); they promote that [Moringa oleifera](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/moringa-oleifera) may boost immunity enough to fight Covid-19. While Moringa oleifera does have some effect on immunity, there is zero evidence to support it may be beneficial in the prevention of Covid-19. Curious Mind Magazine is a quackerly level pseudoscience website.
