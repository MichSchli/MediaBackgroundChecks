[The V-type ATPase enhances photosynthesis in marine phytoplankton and further links phagocytosis to symbiogenesis](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00615-2).

[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Current Biology Journal is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, Cell Press has been criticized for [retracting some studies.](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cell/)
