Analysis / Bias
Currently, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands is
[Mark Rutte,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/netherlands-media-profile/) who leans center-right (Conservative Liberalism is the equivalent of Center-Right in the USA), and he is also the leader of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VDV). [NRC](https://voxeurop.eu/en/source/nrc-handelsblad-2/) is known to be liberal by tradition.
In review, NRC reports news with balance. NRC publishes articles critical of the current prime minister, such as
[“Man of the week: Mark Rutte.”](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/10/01/man-van-de-week-mark-rutte-a4143751) A quote from the article reads, “The longest-serving prime minister of the Netherlands watches visionless and invisible as the Netherlands declines due to the many crises.” NRC also publishes articles critical of far-right populist parties such as Forum for Democracy (FVD): [“The digital thug of Forum for Democracy.”](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/01/21/de-digitale-knokploeg-van-forum-voor-democratie-a4081361) FVD supporters organize with Telegram (messaging app), to spread misinformation, and threaten politicians they oppose.
Editorially, NRC has a favorable tone for the opposition leader of the left-wing labor party Attje Kuiken:
[”The fight against poverty is personal for Kuiken.”](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/04/22/de-strijd-tegen-armoede-is-voor-kuiken-persoonlijk-a4117076) On political issues such as immigration, they report favorably with emotionally loaded language, such as [“I thank God and the UN for my return to Nigeria.”](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/11/24/ik-dank-god-en-de-vn-voor-mijn-terugkeer-naar-nigeria-a4149384#/krant/2022/11/25/#101)
Regarding sourcing, NRC often hyperlinks to itself and credible sources such as
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and government agencies. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Biden administration with a neutral tone while reporting negatively on former President Trump, such as in this article. [”How Joe Biden lost ground — and still won.”](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/11/11/hoe-joe-biden-terrein-verloor-en-toch-won-a4147949) NRC generally reports news factually and with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
