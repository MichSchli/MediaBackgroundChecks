America Rising PAC does not provide information regarding revenue on the website.
[Desmogblog](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/desmog/) [reports](https://www.desmogblog.com/america-rising-llc-pac-america-rising-squared-definers-public-affairs#Hiding%20Donors%20and%20Running%20Attack%20Ads), “America Rising PAC had a budget of $8 million for 2014.” This revenue comes from donations, and due to their 501(c)4 nonprofit status, they do not have to disclose their donors. The HuffPost [reports](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oppo-groups-america-rising-american-bridge_n_4564780?guccounter=1), “Most of its operating revenue will come from clients -– federal party committees, state parties, candidate campaigns, super PACs -– that want the group’s information and are willing to pay for it. America Rising has set itself up to be run like a private enterprise.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, America Rising publishes research on Democratic candidates and politicians. This research tends to be republished articles from other sources. For instance, under the “Research” tab, they published this story from the strongly right biased
[RedState](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/): [Joe Biden’s Past Abortion Comments Draw Devastating Headlines and Fury from the Left](https://americarisingpac.org/joe-bidens-abortion-comments-draw-devastating-headlines-and-fury-from-the-left/). Under the “Take Action” tab displays voting surveys and petitions that favor the right. Under the “news” tab, they republish news articles that are unfavorable to Democrats. They use a wide range of sources such as the left-leaning [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and right-leaning [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/).
In 2017, America Rising, through its lawyer, sought e-mails of career employees of the
[Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/politics/epa-pruitt-media-monitoring.html) who criticized President Donald Trump or EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The e-mail requests provoked fears of political retribution and were described by critics as a “witch hunt.”
