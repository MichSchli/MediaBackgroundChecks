Analysis / Bias
Chattanooga typically focuses on community news, including crime and breaking news, such as
[“Man And Teenager Arrested After Assault, Auto Theft, And 2 Pursuits.”](https://www.chattanoogan.com/2023/7/21/472159/Man-And-Teenager-Arrested-After.aspx) The information is presented as a summary of the incident without hyperlinking to any external sources, which raises questions about the transparency and reliability of the information they publish.
Regarding political bias, they mainly publish commentary pieces; for example, the article
[“Roy Exum: What Biden Has Done”](https://www.chattanoogan.com/2022/5/4/448517/Roy-Exum-What-Biden-Has-Done.aspx) is a commentary piece that criticizes President Biden’s policies and actions. The author, Victor Davis Hanson, is a known conservative commentator whose perspective is right-leaning. The article criticizes Biden’s handling of the border crisis, inflation, energy policies, and the Afghanistan withdrawal. The language used is loaded and biased against Biden. For example, the author states, “Biden knows he inherited a stable, prosperous America and has nearly ruined it.” This statement is a clear example of loaded language that shows a bias against Biden.
Another article,
[“Double Standard? – And Response,”](https://www.chattanoogan.com/2023/6/2/469956/Double-Standard---And-Response.aspx) critiques perceived double standards in media coverage of President Biden and former President Trump. The author suggests that the media is propping up Biden despite his age and physical mishaps, a perspective that leans right. However, there is a rebuttal under the article titled “And Response,” which provides an opposing viewpoint to the original article’s claims of media bias. The presence of a rebuttal provides some balance to the article’s initial claims of media bias. As for the sources, the articles do not provide hyperlinks to their sources. The authors mention several events and policies but do not provide direct sources for these claims. This lack of sourcing makes it difficult for readers to verify the information presented.
Failed Fact Checks

In conclusion, we rate Chattanoogan.com Right-Center Biased based on story selection favorable to the right, and we also rate them as Mostly Factual rather than High due to poor sourcing techniques. (M. Huitsing 07/22/2023)
