Analysis / Bias
InfoGalactic’s newsfeed does not contain original content but rather curated news stories. On their news page, they also link to a host of websites and writers so that readers may view their news. Some notable names on the list that fall within our Questionable or Conspiracy categories are:
[Mike Cernovich](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cerno-cernovich-com/), [Milo Yiannopoulos](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/milo-news/), [Taki’s Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/takis-magazine/), [Return of Kings](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/return-of-kings/), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), and [Roosh V](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stares-at-the-world/). Many of these sources have been labeled White Nationalist, and some appear on the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) website for hate. In reviewing their Wiki pages, they are very similar in content to Wikipedia regarding political figures. InfoGalactic sources all information and typically uses credible sources.
