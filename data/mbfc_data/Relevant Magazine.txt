History
Relevant Magazine is a bimonthly
[Christian lifestyle magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevant_(magazine)) exploring the intersection of faith and pop culture. According to their [about page](https://www.relevantmagazine.com/about/), “We publish ideas that break stereotypes, challenge the status quo, and spur a generation to know God and change their worlds. We want to engage our generation in a deeper conversation about faith, challenging people to see God outside the box they’ve put Him in. We believe in the importance of the Church and want to be catalysts for change rather than part of the mass exodus of our generation leaving it.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Relevant Magazine covers a wide variety of topics but is heavily focused on pop culture. Politically, they support moderate Christian causes; however, they are never overt and do not make firm statements of support. In general, they cover
[both sides](https://relevantmagazine.com/slices/research-more-evangelicals-believe-climate-change-evolution) of political issues, and they always source their information. Relevant Magazine does not rely on loaded words to convey emotion, and we have found zero evidence of failed fact checks.
A sourcing review shows that they utilize credible sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/). Editorially, they focus on left-leaning issues such as [social justice](https://www.relevantmagazine.com/category/justice/social-justice/) and the [environment](https://www.relevantmagazine.com/justice/environment/how-becoming-a-tree-hugger-can-change-your-faith/) but balance this with somewhat conservative viewpoints. Finally, they often report negatively on former President Trump and criticize people who believe he won the 2020 Presidential Election, such as this [Most White Evangelicals Still Believe the 2020 Election Was Stolen](https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/church/most-white-evangelicals-still-believe-the-2020-election-was-stolen/). In general, they report news factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
