History

[about page](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/about-2/), “CDN runs an open editorial policy. No articles are censored just because they don’t toe a certain editorial line. As long as opinion posts are something Conservative readers might be interested in, they get published.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Conservative Daily News publishes conservative news stories from other sources, such as the
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), as well as original summarized reports and commentary. Articles and headlines feature emotionally loaded language, such as this [Greatest Magic Trick: The Most Fraudulent Election In History!](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2021/01/greatest-magic-trick-the-most-fraudulent-election-in-history/) Regarding election fraud, they have consistently promoted misinformation such as this [Exposing Illegal Democrat Voter Fraud Shenanigans](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/11/exposing-illegal-democrat-voter-fraud-shenanigans/), where they state that Wisconsin had more people vote than registered voters, [which is false](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-wisconsin-more-votes-regist/fact-checkwisconsin-did-not-have-more-votes-than-people-registered-idUSKBN27K2WU).
Further, during the Coronavirus outbreak, they frequently downplayed the virus. They promoted conspiracy theories about
[mask-wearing](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/), such as this, [Is Not Wearing a Face Mask the New ‘Yellow Star’](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/12/is-not-wearing-a-face-mask-the-new-yellow-star/). Finally, they have also promoted the [false claim](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/31/facebook-posts/no-cdc-did-not-quietly-adjust-us-coronavirus-death/) that death totals are inflated, such as [The Media Spun The Gateway Pundit’s ‘6% of COVID-19 Deaths’ Article’s Narrative](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/09/op-ed-the-media-spun-the-gateway-pundits-6-of-covid-19-deaths-articles-narrative/). It should be pointed out that the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) is not a reliable or credible news source as they have failed numerous fact checks.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, particularly former
[President Donald Trump](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/?s=trump). Generally, the news is not always reported factually and often with an extreme right-leaning bias that amounts to propaganda for conservatives.
Failed Fact Check
- We cannot find a record of them being fact-checked; however, we point out three examples above, and they use poor sources who frequently failed fact checks.
