Analysis / Bias
In review, End Time Headlines publishes news stories from other sources and sometimes provides a summary of stories. Many stories are not about End Times, such as this from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) [Rare snow blankets Acropolis in Greece](https://endtimeheadlines.org/2021/02/rare-snow-blankets-acropolis-in-greece/) (removed). They generally use credible sources such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) and [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/).
Since our last review, End Times Headlines has stopped promoting conspiracy theories and are reporting straight news from credible sources such as this
[Wall Street’s biggest investors continue to sound the alarm regarding something coming “worse than recession.”](https://endtimeheadlines.org/2022/09/wall-streets-biggest-investors-continue-to-sound-the-alarm-regarding-something-coming-worse-than-recession/) The story comes from [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/).
Editorially, they report negative on former President Trump, such as this from
[NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/): [Trump accused of sharing barrage of QAnon content and other conspiracy theories on his social media platform](https://endtimeheadlines.org/2022/08/trump-accused-of-sharing-barrage-of-qanon-content-and-other-conspiracy-theories-on-his-social-media-platform/). They report factually on abortion issues but use sources that [minimize climate change](https://endtimeheadlines.org/2021/02/bill-gates-unveils-his-master-plan-for-battling-climate-change/), such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). Finally, when writing on Covid-19, they tend to be fact-based. In general, they hold a right-leaning bias and have improved factual reporting.
