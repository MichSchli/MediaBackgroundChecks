Analysis / Bias
The Repustar website features three services. The first is Repustar IQ which is currently in development that examines how much misinformation a person or source generates. Next is FactSparrow, a Chrome Extension and Twitter Bot that tells the user the factual rating of the source. Of note, they use Media Bias Fact Check’s ratings to power FactSparrow. Further, they have a stand-alone website at factsparrow.repustar.com that features a system to upvote claims that need to be fact-checked, such as, “
[Have recent Russian missile strikes targeted civilians?](https://factsparrow.repustar.com/)” The FactSparrow website also features the ability to search for claims that have been fact-checked.
Finally, the website offers
[fact briefs](https://repustar.com/contributor/all) that are published on [Gigafact](https://gigafact.org/). Per the website, “Fact briefs are short, credibly sourced summaries that offer “yes/no” answers in response to claims found online. They rely on publicly available, often primary source data and documents.”
Fact Briefs are derived from various sources, including
[Lead Stories](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lead-stories/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Econofact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/econofact/). An example fact-brief is as follows: [Have 14 members of Adam Laxalt’s family endorsed his opponent Catherine Cortez Masto in the Nevada Senate race?](https://repustar.com/fact-briefs/have-14-members-of-adam-laxalts-family-endorsed-his-opponent-catherine-cortez-masto-in-the-nevada-senate-race) The answer to this question is “Yes,” provided by [The Nevada Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-nevada-independent/), citing credible sources such as [The Reno Gazette-Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reno-journal-gazette-left-center-bias-credible/) and [Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/las-vegas-review-journal/).
In general, Repustar is fact-based and presents a minimal bias in reporting.
