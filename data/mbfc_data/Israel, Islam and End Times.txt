Analysis / Bias
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, many articles come from questionable sources, such as
[David Horowitz](http://www.israelislamandendtimes.com/root-cause-disasters-middle-east/), who is known as the [Grandfather of Islamophobia](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/godfather).
Editorially, they hold strong anti-immigrant bias, especially regarding Muslims, such as this
[Biden Rescinds Trump’s “Muslim Travel Ban” as “Inconsistent with American Values,”](https://www.israelislamandendtimes.com/biden-rescinds-trumps-muslim-travel-ban-as-inconsistent-with-american-values/) and this [Trump Exposes the ‘Great Disparity’: Islam Good; Christianity and Israel Bad](https://www.israelislamandendtimes.com/trump-exposes-the-great-disparity-islam-good-christianity-and-israel-bad/). In general, Israel, Islam, and End Times promote a far-right anti-Islam perspective that relies on unproven and unfounded biblical prophecies.
