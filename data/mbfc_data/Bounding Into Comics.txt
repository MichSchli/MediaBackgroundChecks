History
[Founded in 2014](https://mavenroundtable.io/theloftusparty/groove-on/bounding-into-comics-provides-a-different-perspective-for-a-changing-industry-V03KISTcq0CvG_NjKlWi6g/) by John F. Trent, Bounding Into Comics is a website that reports on comic culture, comic books, and entertainment in general. According to their [about page](https://boundingintocomics.com/meet-the-author/) “What started as a destination for comic book news and reviews has grown into a comprehensive hub for nerd culture. Bounding’s team of comic/anime/gaming/movie/television aficionados leverage their network of press contacts, industry insiders, and content creators to deliver exclusive news, commentary, and insights.” John F. Trent is the Editor-in-Chief.
Bounding into Comics has been accused of promoting hate through their association with
[Comicsgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comicsgate), which rejects progressive themes in comic books. The movement has been described as part of the [alt-right movement](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/leonard-pitts-jr/article223686400.html) and as a harassment, campaign that “targets women, people of color, and LGBT folk in the comic book industry.” Bounding into Comics denies any connection to hate [here](https://boundingintocomics.com/2018/10/25/bounding-into-comics-becomes-the-latest-target-of-industry-professionals/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Bounding Into Comics generally covers news and information related to the comic industry and entertainment news and reviews. Headlines and articles use moderately emotional wording such as this:
[Crazed Star Trek: Discovery Fans Threaten Anas Abdin’s Life](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/10/21/crazed-star-trek-discovery-fans-threaten-anas-abdins-life/). This story is primarily sourced from tweets. The website also provides interviews such as this: [Interview: Howling at the Moon with Brett R. Smith](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/02/19/interview-howling-at-the-moon-with-brett-r-smith/).
Bounding Into Comics does not directly solicit political opinions, but they do report political news when it relates to celebrities or the comics genre, such as this:
[James Bond and Rumored Batman Actor Jeffrey Wright: “Impeach This Corrupt Lowlife Clown](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/10/02/james-bond-and-rumor-batman-actor-jeffrey-wright-impeachment-this-corrupt-lowlife-clown/).” Some articles lean right through reporting such as this claiming supposed conservative censorship: [Wikipedia Editors Attempt Alleged Politically Motivated Deletions of Conservative Sci-Fi Authors’ Entries](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/07/25/wikipedia-editors-attempt-alleged-politically-motivated-deletions-of-conservative-sci-fi-authors-entries/). Although there is a right-leaning bias, this does not represent a significant portion of the content on the website.
Editorially, we have found evidence that they frequently report negatively on Feminism, such as this:
[Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Attacked By Feminists](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/07/31/quentin-tarantinos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-attacked-by-feminists/). In another story, they report negatively on diversity when a Marvel character was petitioned to be portrayed by a gay women of color: [Petition Demands Captain Marvel Be Played By Gay Woman of Color – Not Brie Larson](https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/05/01/petition-demands-captain-marvel-be-played-by-gay-woman-of-color-not-brie-larson/). In general, the information presented is rooted in fact; however, the content context often aligns loosely with the Alt-Right.
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=bounding%20into%20comics&gsc.sort=) reveals they have not failed a fact check. However, further investigation shows that Bounding into Comics had to retract a story that was based on a [fake tweet](https://www.themarysue.com/alyssa-wong-right-wing-attacks-why/), which resulted in the harassment of Alyssa Wong. In an article by The Mary Sue, titled [Right-Wingers Tried to Take Down Author Alyssa Wong With a Fake Tweet. Why?](https://www.themarysue.com/alyssa-wong-right-wing-attacks-why/) They state, “Bounding into Comics regularly runs news stories designed to promote its right-wing agenda in an overt, unsubtle manner. They regularly target and direct hate toward diverse voices.” [According](https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/comicsgate-a-comic-book-harassment-campaign-is-growing.html) to [Vulture](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vulture/), “A Comicsgate news-hub called Bounding Into Comics emerged, where progressive creators and critics are regularly accused of harassing or silencing conservatives.”
