Analysis / Bias
Censored.News does not produce original content but links to other sources through news feeds. The sources they promote read like a who’s who of far-right conspiracy, pseudoscience, and fake news. Some of the sources they promote are
[The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/) (Questionable), [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) (Tin-Foil Hat Conspiracy), [National File](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-file/) (Conspiracy), [Newstarget](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-target/) (Quackery Pseudoscience), and [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/) (Quack anti-Vaxx propaganda). For news aggregation sites such as this, our rating is based on the sources they use. In this case, Censored.News is extremely right-biased and 100% lacking in credibility.
