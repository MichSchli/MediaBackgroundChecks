Analysis / Bias
In review, Breaking News House does not publish original news, but rather takes snippets from existing news stories and offers highly biased right wing opinions to frame the story. There is frequent use of highly emotional language that always favors the right such as this:

Some of the sources utilized are [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), and [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/). Other articles are simply plagiarized such as this: [Reporter Behind Thanksgiving Trump Lie Just Got Worst News](https://breakingnewshouse.com/2019/12/02/reporter-behind-thanksgiving-trump-lie-just-got-worst-news/). This story appears to be [copied and pasted](https://www.westernjournal.com/commentary/) from The Questionable Western Journal without attribution. In general, this is an extreme right wing website that has zero credibility.
