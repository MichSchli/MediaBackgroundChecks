Analysis / Bias
In review, American News 24/7 utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“CNN Anchor Claims He Didn’t Vote For Hillary, Kellyanne Conway Flattens Him”](https://americanewscentral.com/2018/05/20/cnn-anchor-claims-didnt-vote-hillary-kellyanne-conway-flattens/) and “ [John Kerry Attacks Trump: ‘America First’ Won’t Work”](https://americanewscentral.com/2018/05/21/john-kerry-attacks-trump-america-first-wont-work/)
American News 24/7 typically utilizes sources through large blocks of quotes from factually mixed sources such as the
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). American News 24/7’s word choices are pro-Trump, for example [this quote](https://americanewscentral.com/2018/05/21/trump-orders-justice-dept-get-bottom-obama-spying-campaign/) from a recent article: “Man, how times have changed. It’s now a 100% certainty that the Obama Admin. was surveilling Trump looking for some made up Russia collusion nonsense.” This article also quotes factually mixed sources [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), [Breitbart ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/)as well as a credible right-center biased site, the [Washington Examiner.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/)
Essentially, this website looks exactly like the American News Hub, which has previously
[failed fact checks](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/false-stories-roy-moore-accusers/) and has the same owners.
