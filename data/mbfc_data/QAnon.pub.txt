History
[Founded in 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/qanon.pub), QAnon.pub is a website for far-right QAnon conspiracy theorists. QAnon is a collective of anonymous conspiracy theorists who believe the deep state and media conspire against President Trump. “ [The theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon) began with an October 2017 post on the anonymous 4chan by someone using the tripcode Q, a [presumably American individual](http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/12/qanon-4chan-the-storm-conspiracy-explained.html) that may have later grown to include multiple individuals, claiming to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States.”
QAnon adherents began appearing at
[Trump rallies](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-qanon-conspiracy-book-climbs-charts-algorithmic-push-n979181) during the summer of 2018 and have continued to increase.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the QAnon.pub website posts anonymous messages that are signed off as simply Q. A random message looks like this: “Threat to Controlled Narrative. Other than POTUS, can you name a group more attacked than ‘Q’ by the FAKE NEWS media? Multiple tactics deployed, including framing for crimes (think bridge, mob boss, etc.). DESPERATION. Reconcile using logic. THINK FOR YOURSELF. DIVIDERS will FAIL.” This message links into
[8chan](https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/5967167.html#5967783), which has been kicked out of [Google Search](https://observer.com/2015/08/google-blocks-8chan-from-search/). In examining several posts on the QAnon website, virtually all of them support former President Trump and harshly denigrate the left, such as this: “WELCOME TO THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. The Party of threats, violence, intimidation, name-calling, racism, fascism, division, …..#WALKAWAY #VOTEREPUBLICAN Q.” This also links back to the disreputable [8chan](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/8chan).
QAnon promotes some conspiracies: the debunked
[Pizzagate theory](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump), [the Seth Rich murder](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/399801-trump-rally-attendee-holds-up-sign-linked-to-infamous-conspiracy), and most notably, the [Deep State](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-apocalypse-in-america-the-smell-of-fascism-in-the-pro-trump-qanon-conspiracy-1.6809655). They also promote [chemtrails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71oLxDyA3fY) which some [claim](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) Trump has stopped. Lastly, they have been accused of [antisemitism](https://forward.com/news/national/407121/explained-what-s-anti-semitic-about-qanon-the-trump-base-s-latest-pet-theory/).
According to a
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=qanon&gsc.sort=), QAnon has failed numerous fact checks.
