Analysis / Bias
In review, the website covers pseudoscience such as anti-vaccination propaganda
[Aborted Human Remains Used in the Production and Testing of Vaccines — Charisma News](https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2020/12/aborted-human-remains-used-in-the-production-and-testing-of-vaccines-charisma-news/) as well as covid-19 disinformation such as this [How To Avoid Mask Mandates & Vaccine Mandates At Work](https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2020/12/how-to-avoid-mask-mandates-vaccine-mandates-at-work/). There is zero evidence to refute [masks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) as a means of protection from Covid and most airborne diseases. Further, during the election of 2020, they have promoted election fraud conspiracies that have never been proven in the court of law such as this: [Michigan’s Matt Sealy Explains How President Trump Has SEVERAL Paths To Victory…”Never Count Donald Trump Out!” [VIDEO]](https://stillnessinthestorm.com/2020/12/michigans-matt-sealy-explains-how-president-trump-has-several-paths-to-victorynever-count-donald-trump-out-video/). In general, this is an extreme right biased conspiracy site that is rarely factual.
