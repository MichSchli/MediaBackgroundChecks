History
Founded in 1982 by physicist
[Armory Lovins](https://rmi.org/people/amory-lovins/), The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) is a nonprofit organization focusing on profitable innovations for energy and resource efficiency, conducting research, writing books, consulting, and giving lectures on sustainability. According to their [about page](https://rmi.org/our-work/), “RMI is tackling the climate crisis by focusing on its main contributor: energy production and use, which represents 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.”
RMI publishes the website

Funded by / Ownership
[The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)](https://rmi.org/about/history/) is a nonprofit focused on reducing carbon emissions through natural capitalism (market-driven) and government solutions. [According](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/rocky-mountain-institute/#:~:text=RMI%20receives%20substantial%20grants%20from,from%20wealthy%20left%2Dwing%20foundations.) to the right-leaning [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/), “RMI receives substantial grants from the [ClimateWorks Foundation](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/climateworks-foundation/), a left-of-center “pass-through” funding entity that takes donations from wealthy left-wing foundations.” Other notable donors include the Bloomberg Family Foundation, the Sierra Club, and the Oak Foundation.
RMI generates revenue through donations and grants.
Analysis / Bias
The Rocky Mountain Institute advocates carbon reduction to avert a “climate crisis.” The website publishes research and analysis on climate solutions that do not use loaded emotional wording such as this
[Five Key Climate Solutions](https://rmi.org/five-key-climate-solutions/). This story, like most, relies on government sources such as energy.gov.
Editorially, most stories and information covers climate solutions with minimal bias; however, under “
[our impact](https://rmi.org/impact/climate/),” they use emotional wording such as this quote:
Today, we are in the race of our lifetimes: a race against the climate clock that ticks faster with every ton of carbon dioxide emitted into our atmosphere, but fortunately, also a race to a clean, prosperous, and secure low-carbon future.
In general, the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) is fact-based and holds a left-leaning bias regarding climate change and climate solutions.
