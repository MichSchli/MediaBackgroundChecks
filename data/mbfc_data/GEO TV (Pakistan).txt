Analysis / Bias
The owner of Jang Group of Newspapers, which includes Geo TV, Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman,
[has been critical of the government](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-television-media-arrests-tax-evasion-bd3de999a9d5501a85016a8e81fdd68d), and in 2020, he was arrested. In May 2021, Geo News TV [suspended](https://cpj.org/2021/05/pakistani-talk-show-host-hamid-mir-suspended-after-critical-comments-on-the-military/) its talk show host Hamid Mir for [criticizing](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-entertainment-talk-shows-business-cf9d32ca123a987cb2f1224344801cd0) the military during his talk show. As a result, there is a significant limitation to press freedom as criticism of the government has consequences.
In review, GEO TV reports national news with minimally emotionally loaded headlines:
[“PM Imran Khan says considering reaching out to insurgent groups in Balochistan.”](https://www.geo.tv/latest/358486-pm-imran-khan-undertakes-important-visit-to-gwadar-today) The wording of the articles is also relatively neutral. Geo TV publishes articles covering the opposition party with emotionally loaded headlines such as [“PPP wants PM Imran Khan to apologise for comments on why rape cases are increasing.”](https://www.geo.tv/latest/344499-ppp-wants-pm-imran-khan-to-apologise-for-comments-on-why-rape-cases-are-increasing) They typically source information from themselves or their sister papers such as [The News International](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-news-international/). Geo TV reports international news sourcing through large quotes; however, they do not provide [hyperlinking](https://www.geo.tv/latest/359137-us-military-mission-in-afghanistan-will-end-on-aug-31-biden).
Editorially, they have little choice other than to favor the right-leaning government of Pakistan.
