Analysis / Bias
In review, Patheos is difficult to classify by bias because they cover a wide variety of opinions from Christian Conservatism to Atheism. Since the website is essentially a blog broken down into channels the bias level and factual level vary between channels. Patheos is primarily opinion-based, with opinions derived from individual bloggers that may swing right or left. Many of the channels contain pro-science information that debunks pseudoscience and for the most part bloggers responsibly source their information. However, some of the articles reviewed did not offer proper sourcing.
