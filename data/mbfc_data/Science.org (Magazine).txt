Analysis / Bias
In review, the site publishes original news and coverage of space, biology, tech, and politics. Articles related to scientific studies do not contain loaded languages such as this,
[Translating genetic risk of Alzheimer’s disease into mechanistic insight and drug targets](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6512/61). The majority of content on this website and the magazine are peer-reviewed. When it comes to politics, they report only when it relates to science, such as this [Trump’s nominee for USDA science post calls new U.S. climate report ‘genuine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/usda-science-nominee-calls-new-us-climate-report-genuine).’ While this story is negative toward Trump, it does so on a scientific basis and not political.
