History
[Launched in 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business), Fox Business is a cable news channel and website that focuses on business and financial news. Kevin Magee, executive vice president of [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/); [Neil Cavuto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Cavuto) manages content and business news coverage.
The news channel features several shows and hosts that generally report in a balanced neutral tone; however,
[Lou Dobbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Dobbs) is the exception due to consistently endorsing President Trump and espousing [anti-immigrant conspiracy theories.](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/nov/16/lou-dobbs/no-evidence-many-illegal-immigrants-voted-midterm-/)
On 2/5/2021, Fox Business announced they are canceling Lou Dobbs show
[Fox News cancels ‘Lou Dobbs Tonight,’ is expected to part ways with pro-Trump host.](https://newsfactsnetwork.com/2021/02/05/fox-news-cancels-lou-dobbs-tonight-is-expected-to-part-ways-with-pro-trump-host/) [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Fox Business is owned by the
[Fox News Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News) division of [Fox Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Corporation). The Fox Corporation was formed from the 2019 acquisition of [21st Century Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox) by [The Walt Disney Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company). Fox Corp. was spun off from 21st Century Fox, and its stock began trading on March 19, 2019. The Murdoch family owns it via a family trust with 39% interest; [Rupert Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch) is co-executive chairman, while his son [Lachlan Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachlan_Murdoch) is chairman and CEO. Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Fox Business website covers business news, financial news, and politics related to economic matters. Headlines and wording range from minimally to moderately loaded, such as this:
[Dow drops 100 points as Trump blows a hole in trade war hopes](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/us-stocks-to-begin-week-in-the-red-on-trade-concerns). Most headlines, however, are low-biased such as this: [25,000 University of California workers to strike Wednesday](https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/strike-november-2019-university-california). This story is appropriately sourced to the [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) and [Mercury News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-jose-mercury-news/). Further, the website publishes news from wire services such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). They also publish [AP Fact Checks](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ap-fact-check-trump-overstates-the-lethality-of-fentanyl), a [signatory](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories) of the International Fact-Checking Network. (IFCN)
Editorially, Fox Business leans right in economic coverage and sometimes reports negatively on liberal policies such as this:
[The realities of socialist policies](https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6036600895001/#sp=show-clips). They also frequently report positively on the former Trump administration: [Pence touts ‘soaring’ Trump economy](https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6101269116001/#sp=show-clips). In general, the website does not over editorialize and strays from the extremes. TV programming tends to feature hosts that lean slightly right, but again, it is not extreme and mostly covers both sides of issues.
The exception is the former show Lou Dobbs Tonight, which features Dobbs serving as a propaganda mouthpiece for the President, similar to
[Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sean-hannity-bias-rating/) on the Fox News Channel. In fact, Lou Dobbs has [proclaimed](https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6100512937001/#sp=show-clips) Donald Trump the “Greatest President Ever.” The network currently features [Maria Bartiromo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/maria-bartiromo-bias-rating/) as TV host. She frequently made false claims regarding the 2020 elections and has promoted misinformation regarding Covid-19.
