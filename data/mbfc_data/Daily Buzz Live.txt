Analysis / Bias
Daily Buzz Live does not disclaim that this is a satire website; therefore, we must assume it is a fake news website. A sample story is this:
[Real Mermaid Infant Washes Ashore In The Caribbean](http://dailybuzzlive.com/real-mermaid-infant-washes-ashore-caribbean/) or [Kanye Scores 106 Points Against Junior Wheelchair Basketball Team, Makes Kids Cry.](http://dailybuzzlive.com/kanye-scores-against-wheelchair-basketball-team/) This must be a satire site, but they do not state it.
