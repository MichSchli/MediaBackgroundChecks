Arianna Huffington was named president and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group, including AOL properties, [Engadget](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/engadget/), and MapQuest. In 2015, [Verizon bought AOL](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/23/verizon-aol-acquisition_n_7644796.html), and The Huffington Post became part of Verizon. Then, in 2016, [Arianna Huffington resigned](https://www.thedailybeast.com/arianna-huffington-resigns-from-huffpost) as editor-in-chief, and former [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) Johannesburg Bureau Chief [Lydia Polgreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Polgreen) became editor-in-chief.

Politico
[reports](https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/11/the-huffington-post-ending-its-editors-note-about-donald-trump-231044) that during the 2016 presidential elections, every article related to Donald Trump included a note at the bottom indicating Trump as being “racist,” “xenophobe,” “Misogynist”; however, after the election, HuffPost [dropped](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/note-to-readers-why-were-dropping-our-donald-trump-editors-note_us_5822b734e4b0aac624883e87) the note.
In review, HuffPost publishes stories with strong, emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Comey Flips: ‘Vote for Democrats This Fall’”](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-vote-democrat-november_us_5b4ea2ede4b0b15aba89c148) and [“Trump Calls Female Reporter ‘So Obnoxious,’ Tells Her To Be Quiet.”](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-female-reporter-obnoxious-quiet_us_5b23e06ae4b0a0a5277b1c1e) They utilize credible sources such as [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politico,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) and blogs unknown to us, such as [queensjewelvault.blogspot.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queen-elizabeth-trump-brooches_us_5b4f0b24e4b0fd5c73c09eff). Furthermore, HuffPost sources the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) when covering world news, such as [“Mass Graves Suggest Systematic Killing Of Rohingya In Myanmar.”](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rohingya-mass-graves-myanmar_us_5a734e7ae4b0905433b21a6e) Finally, [Science-Based Medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/science-based-medicine/) has [criticized](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/huffington-post-is-at-it-again/) HuffPost for promoting dangerous, implausible pseudo-medicine.
A
[Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/huffington-post/) found that 59% of HuffPost’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 23% Mixed, and 17% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers HuffPost. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) Institute survey found that 36% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 36% do not, ranking them #10 in trust of the major USA news providers. In general, a review of articles shows that more favor the left than the right. While HuffPost primarily relies on credible sources of information, they have failed fact checks and promoted pseudoscience, earning a Mixed factual reporting rating.
