History
[Kialo](https://www.kialo-edu.com/about) was established in 2011 by Errikos Pitsos as a research project to improve public discussions through structured debate. With headquarters in Berlin and New York, Kialo’s primary mission is to create a more thoughtful world by facilitating civil and structured debates.
The platform became publicly accessible in 2017 with the launch of
[Kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com/about), an argument-mapping tool designed to enhance the quality of online debates. In 2019, Kialo expanded into the educational sector with [Kialo-edu.com](https://www.kialo-edu.com/?utm_source=kialo-footer), intended for educators and students [(13 years old and older)](https://www.kialo.com/terms) to enhance critical thinking and argumentation skills in an academic setting.

Analysis / Bias
Kialo organizes debates starting with a central
[thesis statement,](https://www.kialo.com/tour) splitting arguments into supporting (Pro) and opposing (Con) sections. Participants can add their views to either side, and their contributions are ranked by their impact on the thesis statement. The platform’s design encourages constructive participation and filters out irrelevant comments. Using [“claims”](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-promote-enlightened-debate-online/) as debate currency and encouraging counterpoints, Kialo promotes [self-reflection](https://blog.kialo-edu.com/critical-thinking/kialo-edu-pedagogical-framework-argument-mapping/) and a balanced discussion, considering multiple viewpoints. Kialo aims for reasoned discourse and positions itself as an educational tool for developing critical thinking; the diversity of its user base and represented viewpoints ultimately influences its neutrality. The platform hosts various topics, from historical evaluations to contemporary issues.
For instance, debates on Kialo range from historical assessments of the British Empire, such as
[“The British Empire did more harm than good to the people it ruled over” ](https://www.kialo.com/did-the-british-empire-do-more-harm-than-good-to-the-people-it-ruled-over-38709?path=38709.0~38709.3&active=~38709.3) to the impact of AI on democracy, such as [“Is Artificial Intelligence a threat to democratic governance?”](https://www.kialo.com/is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-democratic-governance-62944), illustrating the platform’s capacity for nuanced discussions that weigh various perspectives. In these debates, participants are urged to cite credible sources, enhancing the critical evaluation of information. Examples of the cited sources are [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/), [Amnesty USA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/amnesty-international/), the Arms Control Center [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [Brennan Center for Justice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brennan-center-for-justice/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [The Economist, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economist/) [GZERO Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gzero-media-bias/), [Wikipedia, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/)a piece from Built In, and data from Google Trends and Twitter’s API. The varying credibility of these sources introduces a mix of factual accuracies into the discussions.
In general, they present balanced viewpoints but sometimes rely on factually mixed sources that can impact the factuality of information.
