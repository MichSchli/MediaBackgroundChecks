Analysis / Bias
In review, U.S. News and World Report primarily cover politics, finance, health, and education. They provide original content that uses minimally loaded language such as this:
[Measles Exposure Possible at Chicago Airport](https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-03-01/measles-exposure-possible-at-chicago-midway-airport). Like all others on the website, this story is properly sourced to credible media and organizations such as [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/), the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), and various .gov sites. At this point, US News is best known for its best-of series, such as best states, best countries, best colleges, etc.
Editorially, US News tends to lean slightly left through topic selection. They generally report the news accurately and with a slight left-leaning bias.
