Analysis / Bias
[According](https://thewire.in/media/india-big-media-paid-news) to [The Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-wire-india/), “most newspapers in India would be completely unprofitable were it not for government advertising and other rent that they can collect. [Bloomberg ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/here-s-what-modi-spent-to-sell-the-india-story-around-the-world), “India’s government spent $640 million on advertisements.” Therefore, the media must be close to the ruling government.
In review, Catch News publishes articles with emotionally loaded language and with a
[critical Narendra Modi tone](http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/mr-narendra-modi-here-s-an-open-letter-to-you-and-your-government-asking-you-to-stop-this-politics-of-religion-138547.html) (Current Prime Minister and right-wing nationalist party [BJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) leader) such as [“Narendra Modi’s Republic of Fear”](http://www.catchnews.com/politics-news/narendra-modi-s-republic-of-fear-1463328420.html) and [“Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Statue Of Unity: Modi Ji, instead upon the statue, here’s how you could have used Rs 3000 crore.”](http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/sardar-vallabhbhai-patel-statue-of-unity-modi-ji-instead-upon-the-statue-here-s-how-you-could-have-used-rs-3000-crore-139115.html)
The
[Economic Times India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economic-times/) reports that due to its political ideology (The group that owns Catch News as well as its sister publication, Rajasthan Patrika), [Patrika claimed](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sc-nudges-vasundhara-raje-govt-to-address-rajasthan-patrikas-ad-worries/articleshow/53988291.cms) a sharp decline in government advertisements with a quote that reads, “both display and classified ads issued by the state had dipped to all-time lows, and this was affecting its circulation too.”
Recently, however, the tone has been more neutral towards PM Modi, such as this republished story from
[ANI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/asian-news-international-ani/) news agency [“PM Modi plants saplings in Parliament as part of plantation drive.”](http://www.catchnews.com/national-news/pm-modi-plants-saplings-in-parliament-as-part-of-plantation-drive-168133.html)
When it comes to sourcing, Catch News often hyperlinks to itself. It republishes articles from Indian news agencies such as ANI news agency and PTI (The Press Trust of India Ltd.). Further, they occasionally publish sensational stories under the section “Bizarre news,” which is poorly sourced and consists of clickbait headlines:
[“Believe it or not! Watch how raw chicken jumps out of dish prepared at restaurant; netizens left shocked!”](http://www.catchnews.com/bizarre-news/believe-it-or-not-watch-how-raw-chicken-jumps-out-of-dish-prepared-at-restaurant-netizens-left-shocked-168466.html)
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a relatively neutral tone, such as this:
[“US President Donald Trump presents Pakistan PM Imran Khan a cricket bat at White House.”](http://www.catchnews.com/cricket-news/us-president-donald-trump-presents-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-a-cricket-bat-at-white-house-167818.html)
