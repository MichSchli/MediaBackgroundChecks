History
World Press Review (Worldpress.org) is an independent, nonpartisan New York-based magazine founded in 1974. Worldpress.org publishes originally written articles and analyses various world issues, from environment and human rights to regional politics and armed conflicts. According to its editorial guideline, Worldpress.org mostly focuses on the issues which are barely reflected in the mainstream press, translating, reprinting, analyzing, and contextualizing what it evaluates as “the best of the international press” from more than 20 languages. World Press relies on its web of freelancers from approximately 40 countries for its originally written material.
