History
Founded in 1970,
[NPR](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/192827079/overview-and-history) (National Public Radio) is a nonprofit organization that produces and distributes news, talk, cultural programming, music, and entertainment programs, including the premier news magazines Morning Edition and All Things Considered across broadcast and digital platforms. NPR is based in Washington, D.C.
NPR was established after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the
[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967](https://www.byrdcenter.org/byrd-center-blog/the-passage-of-the-public-broadcasting-act-of-1967). The act created the [Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB)](https://www.cpb.org/faq#1-2), [the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), and National Public Radio (NPR).
The first program broadcast on
[NPR](https://www.poynter.org/news/today-media-history-npr-began-45-years-ago) was live coverage of the U.S. Senate deliberations on the Vietnam War in April 1971. NPR has also [won numerous awards](https://www.npr.org/about/press/NPR_Fact_Sheet.pdf) since its launch. Currently, [Jarl Mohn](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/05/09/310715871/npr-names-jarl-mohn-as-its-new-ceo-and-president) is the NPR CEO, and the Ombudsman/Public Editor is [Elizabeth Jensen.](https://www.npr.org/people/384352444/elizabeth-jensen) A list of NPR’s Board of Directors can be found [here.](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/182676957/npr-board-of-directors) [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis
In 2000, the conservative pro-Israel media watchdog group CAMERA
[accused NPR](https://www.momentmag.com/is-npr-anti-israel/) of being biased against Israel. In 2001, [FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/), a progressive media watchdog group, criticized NPR for [favoring Israel](https://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/for-npr-violence-is-calm-if-it8217s-violence-against-palestinians/). FAIR also [states](https://fair.org/press-release/npr-responds-to-fairs-npr-study/), “NPR is definitely skewing right.” Tim Groseclose, a professor in the Economics and Political Science Department at UCLA, and Jeff Milyo, an economics professor at the University of Missouri, [report](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/06/16/book-liberal-media-distorts-news-bias) NPR has a liberal bias. According to a [Pew Research survey](http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/npr/), 67% of NPR listeners identify as left of center, with 41% being consistently liberal. Finally, According to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), NPR CEO Jarl Mohn has [contributed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/npr-taps-jarl-mohn-as-new-ceo/2014/05/09/37382d9c-d78c-11e3-95d3-3bcd77cd4e11_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e2d3e9c205d5) to Democratic candidates in statewide races, including Robert Reich’s campaign, President Bill Clinton’s secretary of labor.
Bias
In review, NPR (National Public Radio) uses moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[“President Trump’s Description of What’s ‘Fake’ Is Expanding.”](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/02/643761979/president-trumps-description-of-whats-fake-is-expanding) Generally, story selection favors the Left with stories such as these: [“Rise Of LGBTQ Candidates Could Usher In A ‘Rainbow Wave’ In 2018,”](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/03/643686397/rise-of-lgbtq-candidates-could-usher-in-a-rainbow-wave-in-2018) and [Majority Of Americans Don’t Want Roe v. Wade Overturned](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/25/632267000/majority-dont-want-roe-v-wade-overturned). They also report right-leaning opinion pieces such as this: [A Free-Market Economy Keeps Capitalism Ticking.](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114206592)
NPR reports world news with neutral headlines such as “
[In Bangladeshi Camps, Rohingya Refugees Try To Move Forward With Their Lives.](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/30/643008438/in-bangladeshi-camps-rohingya-refugees-try-to-move-forward-with-their-lives) NPR typically sources their information to credible sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), maristpoll.marist.edu, ohchr.org, [The Economist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economist/), UNICEF, [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), etc. NPR’s news reporting is consistently low-biased, factual, and covers both sides of issues.
However, taken on a whole, NPR is favored by a liberal audience, which indicates programming and story selection tends to lean left to appeal to their core listeners. For example, A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/npr/) found that 67% of NPR’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 21% Mixed, and 12% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience strongly prefers NPR. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 44% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 31% do not, ranking them #7 in trust of the major USA news providers.
