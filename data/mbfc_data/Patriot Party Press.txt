Analysis / Bias
In review, Patriot Party Press is a satirical website that mocks conservatives with stories they might share. The website displays on their
[about page](https://bustatroll.org/about-us/) that they are satire: “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie, and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental, and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you’re still having an issue with that satire thing.”
In general, stories are designed to outrage conservatives into sharing on social media, such as this:
[Pelosi Expansion of Section 230 to Force Shut Down of Fox News, OAN](https://patriotpartypress.com/screw-fox-and-oan/).
Although this site and all of Christopher Blair’s properties disclaim they are satire, they are still frequently fact-checked by fact-checkers because his stories are often shared on social media as real.
