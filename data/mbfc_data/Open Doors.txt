History
[Founded in 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Doors), Open Doors is a non-denominational mission supporting persecuted Christians in over 70 countries where Christianity is socially or legally discouraged or oppressed. The organization also publishes an annual [World Watch List](https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/world-watch-list/) which ranks countries by the severity of the persecution that Christians face for actively pursuing their faith. The WWL is based on the research and comparison of field researchers, external experts, academics, and publicly available research documents.
The founder is
[Andrew van der Bijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_van_der_Bijl), who is more widely known as [Brother Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother_Andrew) when he decided to smuggle Bibles to discriminated Christians in Communist Poland. In 2015, Open Doors (including its affiliates) delivered 3 million Bibles and literature and delivered relief and aid to 239,164 people.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Open Doors’
[primary mission](https://www.opendoorsusa.org/about-us/) is to empower Christians who are persecuted for their beliefs. They do this by providing financial help and Bibles to those in countries with significant Christian minorities. They also report news about Christian persecutions around the world. For example, in this article: [A DARK REALITY—CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN 73 COUNTRIES FACE HIDDEN PERSECUTION EVERY DAY,](https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/stories/christian-women-73-countries-hidden-persecution-every-day/) they write a detailed and compelling account of the persecution of Christians, but they do not provide a single link or source to validate these claims. Sadly, these claims may be true, but the reader has no way of knowing without further unnecessary research. In another article that you can view here, they again do not provide linked evidence, but rather offer prayers.
Open Doors has rarely been criticized for not delivering donated to money to their causes, but according to the
[Orange County Register](https://www.ocregister.com/2015/03/10/watchdog-when-donating-to-charity-do-you-know-how-much-is-going-to-the-actual-cause/) “A campaign for Open Doors With Brother Andrew of Santa Ana raised $7,753 – of which the charity got $7.75.”
In general, Open Doors is considered a reputable charity with an 88% rating from
[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4264). While they obviously hold pro-Christian views, they do not publish politics on their website but rather focus on Christian Persecution and the establishment of Christianity in places that are currently hostile.
