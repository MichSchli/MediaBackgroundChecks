The President of CNI is Alison Weir, a former journalist and the founder of
[If Americans Knew](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/if-america-knew/), a nonprofit organization that focuses on the Israel-Palestine conflict, specializing in statistical analysis. If America Knew has been criticized by the [Anti-Defamation League (ADL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) for what they deemed anti-Semitic statements, which [Alison Weir characterizes](http://alisonweir.org/journal/2009/2/13/anti-defamation-league-defames-me-my-letter-to-the-adl.html) as defamation. On the other hand, [Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/) has called If Americans Knew “ [Valuable](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215202806/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=22&media_view_id=5437). “ [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The CNI has a long history of opposing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and generally favors the Palestinian position. They frequently oppose the funding Israel receives from the United States such as
[Despite coronavirus-caused cutbacks, Israel expects to get full $3.8 billion](https://councilforthenationalinterest.org/despite-coronavirus-caused-cutbacks-israel-expects-to-get-full-3-8-billion/). In fact, they have an entire section of the website dedicated to this [Cost of Israel to the US](https://councilforthenationalinterest.org/cost/).
Editorially, CNI is completely one-sided in its opposition to Israel’s government, and its actions with commentary such as this
[Tucker Carlson Exposes Zionist Hypocrisy on Immigration](https://councilforthenationalinterest.org/tucker-carlson-exposes-zionist-hypocrisy-on-immigration/). Although it has not been classified as a hate group, some of its staff, including the President, have been [cited by](https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/alison-weir) the [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) for employing “anti-Semitic imagery and portraying Israel and its agents as ruthless forces that control American policy; through brutal intimidation and deception.” When it comes to politics, they generally do not support President Biden [Another Zionist Joins the Biden Team](https://councilforthenationalinterest.org/another-zionist-joins-the-biden-team/) or former President Trump [Trump Dances to Israel’s Tune](https://councilforthenationalinterest.org/trump-dances-to-israels-tune/).
Rating CNI on a left-right scale is difficult. The bottom line is they oppose Israel. For that, we rate them Questionable and perhaps left of center in bias.
