Analysis / Bias
Boundless is an informational website focusing on legal immigration matters. It features a dedicated section on immigration news to inform readers about the latest U.S. immigration policies. While generally focusing on immigration-related topics, the website’s content shows some leanings in its portrayal of certain policies.
For example, an article titled
[“USCIS Reverses Trump-Era Policy Denying Certain Immigrant Visa Applications”](https://www.boundless.com/blog/uscis-reverses-trump-era-policy-denying-immigrant-visa-applications/) presents the policy changes positively. This article aligns with the [Biden administration’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) efforts to ease barriers to legal Immigration and focuses on the factual aspects of the policy changes. They cite sources such as official statements and policies from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Department of Homeland Security. It includes direct quotes from Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Acting USCIS Director Tracy Renaud.
On the other hand, the article
[“A Detailed Guide to Trump’s Immigration Policies”](https://www.boundless.com/blog/trump-immigration-policies/) uses more emotionally loaded language to describe immigration policies from [President Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) administration. Terms like ‘bombastic rhetoric’ and phrases implying a lack of support from the Trump administration for certain programs convey a subjective viewpoint. The tone is somewhat critical of Trump’s policies, describing them as efforts to make it “far harder for people to settle in America. The site references a diverse range of sources, including the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Chicago Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/chicago-tribune/), [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/), [Migration Policy Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/migration-policy-institute/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/), [Times of India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-india/), [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/#google_vignette), [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/#google_vignette), [ACLU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-civil-liberties-union-aclu/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [The Economic Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economic-times/#google_vignette), and [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/).
In general, Boundless Immigration is fact-based but displays a slight left-leaning bias. It offers detailed information on immigration policies, but the emotional language in some articles may frame certain political stances in a critical light.
