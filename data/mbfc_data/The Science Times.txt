Analysis / Bias
In review, The Science Times publishes news and information related to science in medicine, space, AI, and the environment. Articles and headlines do not use loaded language such as this
[COVID-19: Children Might Carry Up to 100 Times More Viral Genetic Material Than Adults](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/26696/20200731/covid-19-children-carry-up-100-times-viral-genetic.htm). This story is sourced to JAMA Pediatrics. In fact, most articles on the website are sourced from credible scientific journals and research studies such as [The Lancet](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-lancet/), [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), and the [National Academy of Sciences](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-academy-of-sciences-nas/).
While most information is credible science, they also occasionally run sensational stories like this:
[An Unknown 15-Foot Creature Washed up on Merseyside, UK Beach](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/26708/20200802/unknown-15-foot-creature-washed-up-merseyside-uk-beach.htm). This story is sourced to the Questionable [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), which frequently publishes false and misleading information.
Further, they have also published
[misinformation](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25885/20200601/yale-epidemiologist-hydroxychloroquine-used-standard-covid-19-treatment-despite-being-harmful.htm) regarding the [Coronavirus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/). The Science Times is not a credible pro-science source as they lack transparency, occasionally utilize poor sources, and have failed fact checks.
