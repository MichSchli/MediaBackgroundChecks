[City, MPCA looking into YMCA pool dump](https://www.austindailyherald.com/2020/01/city-mpca-looking-into-ymca-pool-dump/). National and international news is typically served by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and, occasionally, [Minnesota Public Radio](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/).
Editorially, the Austin Daily Herald labels their opinion section appropriately with more editorials favoring the left, such as this:
[Workforce Immigrants, refugees key to economic growth](https://www.austindailyherald.com/2020/01/others-opinion-workforce-immigrants-refugees-key-to-economic-growth/).
