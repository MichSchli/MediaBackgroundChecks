Analysis / Bias
In review, Patriots for Truth publishes news stories that are often conspiratorial and false. For example, they reported that Vice Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris is not a USA citizen
[U. S. Senator Kamala Harris is not a United States citizen. Demand her deportation immediately.](https://patriots4truth.org/2020/08/11/kamala-harris-is-not-a-united-states-citizen/) In this story, they post a variety of documents trying to prove she is a citizen of Jamaica and not the USA. Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, and is a natural citizen through birthright.
When not promoting birtherism they conjure up conspiracy theories regarding 5G serving as a weapon
[227 Million Americans GONE by 2025!](https://patriots4truth.org/2018/05/26/227-million-americans-gone-by-2025/) as well as wild conspiracies regarding the Coronavirus [Definitive proof that Coronavirus is a globalist bioweapons](https://patriots4truth.org/2020/01/28/corona-virus-is-a-globalist-bioweapon/). Besides conspiracies, they also promote pseudoscience such as [anti-vaccine propaganda](https://patriots4truth.org/2020/03/03/rn-discovers-vaccines-are-injecting-cancer/). In general, virtually everything on this website is either fake, false, or misleading.
