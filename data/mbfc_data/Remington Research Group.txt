Analysis / Bias
Remington Research Group uses a
[sound methodology](https://remingtonresearchgroup.com/about/) that has produced accurate polls. For example, they were one of only three polls that saw [Donald Trump winning](http://fortune.com/2016/11/11/pollster-brandseye-donald-trump-brexit-social-media/) the 2016 Presidential election. The website also publishes reasonably balanced news, but on the whole more favor the right such as this [New poll shows Sarah Huckabee Sanders with a 57-point lead in Arkansas GOP primary](https://remingtonresearchgroup.com/new-poll-shows-sarah-huckabee-sanders-with-57-point-lead-in-arkansas-gop-primary/). [FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/), an expert on measuring and rating pollster performance, has evaluated 53 polls by RRG, indicating they are accurate 72% of the time or Mostly Factual. They also conclude that their polling favors the left with a score of +1.2, which equates to a Left-Center bias in polling. In general, RRG is a reasonably accurate pollster that slightly favors the left (Democratic Candidates).
Although Remington’s may skew right with their news selection, their polling leans left, therefore we consider Remington a least biased source.
