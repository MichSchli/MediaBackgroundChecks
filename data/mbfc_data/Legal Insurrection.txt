History
Founded in 2008, Legal Insurrection is a conservative blog by William A. Jacobson, an American lawyer and professor. According to their
[about page](https://legalinsurrection.com/about/) “Our work has been highlighted by top conservative radio personalities, and virtually every major conservative publication and many mainstream media publications.”
The website lacks transparency as some authors use pseudonyms rather than their names, such as Fuzzy Slippers and New Neo.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Legal Insurrection is a conservative blog that frequently uses loaded language in articles and headlines such as this:
[Pitting Americans against each other in the “Climate Change” debate](https://legalinsurrection.com/2019/05/pitting-americans-against-each-other-in-the-climate-change-debate/). This story uses proper sources such as [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the factually mixed [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). Other articles are unfavorable to the left, such as this: [Croissant-gate: Ocasio-Cortez outraged by the inhumane cost of capitalist croissants at LaGuardia Airport.](https://legalinsurrection.com/2019/04/croissant-gate-ocasio-cortez-outraged-by-inhumane-cost-of-capitalist-croissants-at-laguardia-airport/) This article is primarily soured to Twitter posts. The Legal Insurrection frequently reports on [climate change](https://legalinsurrection.com/?s=climate+change&image.x=0&image.y=0); though they do not outright deny human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they do sow doubt and tend to favor free-market solutions. In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left.
