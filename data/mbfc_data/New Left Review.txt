Analysis / Bias
In review, New Left Review is a socialist-leaning magazine that presents in-depth, well-sourced reporting. Headlines and articles contain moderately biased wording such as this:
[RED FLAG OVER THE WHITE HOUSE?](https://newleftreview.org/issues/II119/articles/benjamin-kunkel-red-flag-over-the-white-house) The website also promotes [feminism](https://newleftreview.org/issues/II119/articles/susan-watkins-beating-the-beadles) and equal rights, which aligns with the political left. They further promote [pro-science points](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) of view when it comes to [climate change](https://newleftreview.org/issues/II116/articles/mary-mellor-an-eco-feminist-proposal), which also has been associated with the left. Editorially, this publication has never been a fan of conservatives such as this: [CONSERVATIVES AND CORPORATISM](https://newleftreview.org/issues/I166/articles/bill-schwarz-conservatives-and-corporatism). In general, this is a left-leaning website that endorses socialism and denigrates conservatism. Information, however, is well-sourced.
