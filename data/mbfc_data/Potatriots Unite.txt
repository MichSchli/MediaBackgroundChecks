Analysis / Bias
In review, Potatriots clearly disclaims in their logo they are “for satire and mockery”. In other words, they are transparent in their disclosure. Satire on this website often denigrates the right such as this,
[Hannity Reveals the Real Reason Shep Smith was Fired From Fox News](https://potatriotsunite.com/hannity-reveals-hes-a-total-turd/) and this [Hillary Confesses:’I Am The Greatest Criminal Mastermind The World Has Ever Known. I’m Untouchable. I’m A Genius’](https://bebest.website/hillary-rules-the-universe/). In general, this is a satire website that pokes fun at conservatives who believe these stories.
