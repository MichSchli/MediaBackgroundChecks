Funded by / Ownership
The website does not indicate who owns them; however, it lists the M.E.O.W.I.E. Foundation as an owner when you click on the donation link. The
[M.E.O.W.I.E Foundation Inc](https://www.bizapedia.com/hi/meowie-foundation-inc.html). is a registered nonprofit under the category “NONPROFIT PET RESCUE AND BROADCASTING.” Carol Hall is listed as the CEO. The company’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/meowie.org/) claims they seek “Justice for abused and abandoned cats.” Advertising, donations, and a store that sells pro-Trump merchandise generate revenue.
In researching the foundation, they
[filed a lawsuit](https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3453&context=historical) against Google/YouTube for censorship and terminating their channel based on hate speech, resulting in lost advertising revenue. On line 26. of the court filing, they state, “YOUTUBE began a censorship campaign against Plaintiff shortly after Plaintiff posted a video showing proof that George Floyd, Sandy Hook, and El Paso shootings were planned events using paid actors. YOUTUBE responded by taking down this video and labeled Plaintiff’s YouTube channel “hate speech.” M.E.O.W.I.E. seeks $50k in damages.
Analysis / Bias
Beach Broadcast News publishes videos to Rumble, Spotify Radio programming, and news stories on the website. The content holds a far-right perspective that utilizes emotional language such as this
[PART 2 – BACK FIRE!! Let’s Goooo!! Colin Powell leaves earth!](https://www.beachbroadcastnews.com/post/part-2-back-fire-let-s-goooo-colin-powell-leaves-earth) The website also publishes false conspiracy-related information such as this [50,000 Secret USA Troops – Deputized! Just getting started!](https://www.beachbroadcastnews.com/post/50-000-secret-usa-troops-deputized-just-getting-started) This is a QANON-related conspiracy where they [imagine](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/10/fact-check-no-evidence-trump-commands-50000-secret-troops-and-deputized-them-as-us-marshals.html) the former President is still in charge or coming back to power.
Editorially, Beach Broadcast News holds far-right opinions and near worship of former President Donald Trump,
[Trump Weaponized the American People! Sheriff deputize civilians!](https://www.beachbroadcastnews.com/post/trump-weaponized-the-american-people-sheriff-deputize-civilians) This is sourced from the low credibility [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which fails fact checks nearly daily. As seen above in their lawsuit claim, they make unsubstantiated claims involving false flags in which actors are used to stage gun violence or to change the narrative in situations they disagree with. In general, they are extreme right-biased, frequently publish misinformation, and lack credibility through a lack of transparency, poor sources, and promotion of conspiracy theories.
