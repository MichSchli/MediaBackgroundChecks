Analysis / Bias
[On The Issues](https://www.ontheissues.org/Recent.htm) provides a platform to inform voters about politicians’ stances on various issues. They rely heavily on direct quotes and their [voting records](https://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Richard_Shelby.htm); For instance, they quote Republican Presidential Candidate [Perry Johnson](https://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2024_Hopefuls_Perry_Johnson.htm) “saying, “Number three, you may not like this, but I’m getting rid of the Department of Education.” However, the selection of quotes and the framing of issues can introduce subtle biases. For example, emphasizing certain issues over others or choosing specific quotes can influence readers’ perceptions. But overall, the site generally maintains a balanced presentation. They attribute sources, as seen with the quote from Johnson from the [Iowa Capital Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/iowa-capital-dispatch/). However, it’s worth noting that some of the internal links provided for further information are broken.
In general, On The Issues is fact-based and presents information with minimal bias.
