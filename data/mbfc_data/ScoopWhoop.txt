Analysis / Bias
In review, The website creates and curates India specific stories. Scoopwhoop features many stories on social issues with little focus on USA news unless it’s viral, similar to
[Buzzfeed](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/buzzfeed/). The articles about the USA tend to link to credible sources such as [Reuters](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), however, the stories are often misleading due to the use of emotional words or outright false claims. For example, in an article titled “ [Russia Vows ‘Adequate Response’ After US Expels 35 Russian Diplomats For ‘Spying’](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Russia-Vows-Adequate-Response-After-US-Expels-35-Russian-Diplomats-For-Spying#.xppmxmh8t),” Scoopwhoop claims in a quote, that according to the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), Russia will “cause the US government [‘significant destruction’](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/rd?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-us-canada-38464612)“. This simply is not true as Putin never said this and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38464612) never reported it. Further, according to Logically ScoopWhoop was one of [17 media outlets in India agreed to push polarising stories for money](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/37b58b17). In general, there is a left-leaning editorial bias, and the news is not always reported factually.
