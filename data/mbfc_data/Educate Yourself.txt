Analysis / Bias
In review, the website appears to have the same design as it did in 1998. We are not criticizing it, as our website has been called outdated as well. Just pointing out the design. Content-wise, this source frequently rails against perceived Jewish Supremacists, such as this
[Jewish Insider Described Child Sacrifice](https://www.henrymakow.com/incest_survivor_lifted_veil_on.html). They also frequently host audio of White nationalist David Duke, [Dr. David Duke ~ Facts Surrounding the Tyranny of Jewish Control & Domination of American Media](https://tinyurl.com/yavu4sga).
When not promoting antisemitic material, they frequently promote conspiracy theories such as
[chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), [forbidden cures](https://educate-yourself.org/fc/), [anti-vax propaganda](https://educate-yourself.org/vcd/index.shtml#top), [mind control](https://educate-yourself.org/mc/), [climate change as a hoax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), etc, etc. Finally, they have an entire section called [9-11, The Greatest Act of Treason in American History](https://educate-yourself.org/cn/missinglinksvideo31aug08.shtml). Words really can’t describe the content of this website. They take crackpottery to a whole new level.
