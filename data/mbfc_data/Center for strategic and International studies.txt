History
Established over 50 years ago, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is a Washington DC-based think tank, nonprofit policy research organization dedicated to providing strategic insights and policy solutions to help decision-makers chart a course toward a better world.
The think tank is known for inviting well-known foreign policy and public service officials from the U.S. Congress and the executive branch, including those affiliated with either the Democratic or the Republican Party and foreign officials of varying political backgrounds. It has been labeled a “centrist” think tank by U.S. News & World Report.

Analysis / Bias
In review, CSIS regularly publishes books, reports, newsletters, and commentaries targeted at decision-makers in policy, government, business, and academia. Their flagship publication is the Washington Quarterly. CSIS publishes in-depth factual and low-biased reports such as this Civil Society in the North Caucasus. They also publish well-sourced opinion commentary that is factual and minimally biased as well: Hope for the Climate. Finally, the website offers several blogs covering different topics that are less formal than their research and, again, minimally biased in the presentation. In general, this is a highly factual low biased source of information.
