In review, the Government Accountability Project is an organization that investigates allegations of government corruption and whistleblower cases. They operate as an advocate for whistleblowers of both government and corporations. For example, in 2013, they worked with whistleblower
[Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), who began working with journalists to reveal widespread mass surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency. In early 2007, Government Accountability Project was responsible for [exposing fraud and abuse](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032701953.html) at the highest levels of the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank). In May 2007, World Bank President [Paul Wolfowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wolfowitz) left the international organization in the wake of wide-ranging [scandals](https://www.ft.com/content/023bffd4-03cb-11dc-a931-000b5df10621) based on multiple releases of documents over the previous two months by the Government Accountability Project. In general, GAP provides [Education & Partnerships](https://whistleblower.org/education-partnerships-2), [Legislative Initiatives](https://whistleblower.org/methodology/#LegislativeInitiatives), [Litigation](https://whistleblower.org/methodology/#Litigation), and [Investigations](https://whistleblower.org/methodology/#Investigations).
The website also features news that generally republishes stories that feature GAP, such as this from
[Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/): [GOP Push to Reform FISA Gains Momentum in Wake of Horowitz Report](https://whistleblower.org/in-the-news/fox-news-gop-push-to-reform-fisa-gains-momentum-in-wake-of-horowitz-report/). This story is very well sourced to credible media outlets. Editorially, GAP reports negatively on former President Trump, especially as it relates to the Ukrainian Phone Call Whistleblower: [Law and Crime: GOP Rep Calling Whistleblower a Liar Was Trump’s First Choice for Job of Withholding Whistleblower Complaint](https://whistleblower.org/in-the-news/law-and-crime-gop-rep-calling-whistleblower-a-liar-was-trumps-first-choice-for-job-of-withholding-whistleblower-complaint/). In general, news reporting is factual with a left-leaning bias.
