[editors](https://www.unitedvoice.com/about-us/) reviewing hundreds of stories daily. However, the editors are not named.

Analysis / Bias
United Voice states that its goals are to stimulate critical thinking around today’s most important issues and to cut through the noise by summarizing key issues and presenting alternative viewpoints as well as in-depth analysis. The website also states that it supports “traditional family values,” aims to protect the military, and focuses on disaster preparedness and constitutional rights. These statements, particularly the emphasis on “traditional family values” and protecting the military, suggest a right-leaning bias.
Upon reviewing the content of United Voice, several articles and headlines suggest a right-leaning bias. Here are some examples:
[Johnson Marries Ukraine Aid to Border Security](https://www.unitedvoice.com/johnson-marries-ukraine-aid-to-border-security/) [House Passes Resolution Opening Possibility of Conflict With Iran](https://www.unitedvoice.com/house-passes-resolution-opening-possibility-of-conflict-with-iran/) [Ilhan Omar Slammed by Challenger: “We Are Not Like Her”](https://www.unitedvoice.com/ilhan-omar-slammed-by-challenger-we-are-not-like-her/)
These articles, along with the website’s emphasis on “traditional family values” and protecting the military, further confirm its right-leaning stance. Further, the website sometimes relies on poor sources such as
