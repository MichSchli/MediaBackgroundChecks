Analysis / Bias
The Voice publishes news, opinions, entertainment, and lifestyle information for the African-Caribbean community in the UK. Articles and headlines do not contain loaded emotional wording like this:
[Taking care of your mental health from the ‘Inside Out](https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/community/2022/05/12/taking-care-of-your-mental-health-from-the-inside-out/).’ Articles are properly sourced via hyperlinks to credible sources. The website also features original world news reporting, such as this [Caribbean countries are the least polluted in world](https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/world-news/2022/07/14/caribbean-countries-are-the-least-polluted-in-world%ef%bf%bc/).
Editorially, The Voice properly labels opinion content that moderately favors the left
[Lee Jasper: Surviving Boris Johnson](https://www.voice-online.co.uk/opinion/comment/2022/07/11/lee-jasper-surviving-boris-johnson/). A quote from the article reads, “HE’S GONE. Well, sort of. I’ve written extensively on Boris’s unprincipled character and lack of ethics and moral backbone over the last 14 years.” Politically, they favor the Labour Party [Black voters won it for Labour](https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/uk-news/2022/05/06/black-voters-won-it-for-labour/). The Voice generally reports news mostly factual and holds a moderate left-leaning editorial bias.
