History
Launched on April 19, 2021, Frank Speech, also known as (Frank), is a new social media network by Mike “my pillow guy” Lindell. Mike Lindell is a strong supporter of former President Trump and, after the 2020 election, has promoted a series of false election fraud conspiracies, claiming Trump won the election.
In January 2021, Mike Lindell and his company website My Pillow were
[banned from Twitter](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-has-permanently-banned-the-corporate-my-pillow-account-after-founder-mike-lindell-posted-from-it-11612286764) due to the promotion of false election fraud conspiracies. Furthermore, his videos alleging election fraud were taken down by Youtube. In February 2021, Dominion Voting Systems filed a [1.3 billion dollar defamation lawsuit](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/970117188/dominion-voting-systems-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-mypillow-ceo-mike-linde) against Lindell for publishing false information regarding their voting system.

Funded by / Ownership
It has been reported that Mike Lindell invested
[millions of dollars](https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-lindell-access-social-media-frank-block-swearing-porn-blasphemy-2021-4) into this social media network, and therefore he is the presumed owner. At this point, there does not appear to be a source of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
As stated above, at this time, none of the social media features are available on Frank. The two videos on the website link to his new website
[Lindell TV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lindell-tv/) and a link to his debunked election conspiracy video, [Absolute Interference](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/mypillow-ceos-video-rehashes-debunked-election-fraud-claims/).
Mike Lindell describes his new social media network as a combination of Twitter and Youtube with free speech. Interestingly, speech is only free if Mike Lindell approves.
[He said](https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-lindell-access-social-media-frank-block-swearing-porn-blasphemy-2021-4), “Although the site supports free speech, people won’t be able to post swear words, porn, or death threats.”
This review only looks at the content on the website at the time of review. Currently, the content consists of extreme-right conspiracy videos that are not factual.
