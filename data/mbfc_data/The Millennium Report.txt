Analysis / Bias
In review, The Millennium Report is an extreme right biased website that promotes pro-Russia and
[pro-Assad propaganda](http://themillenniumreport.com/2018/05/how-one-mans-courage-triggered-the-collapse-of-the-british-american-empire/). Throughout the website, there is significant anti-Clinton rhetoric with the term “Lock Her Up” used frequently. There is significant use of loaded words in headlines and articles such as this: “ [Here’s the proven Deep State conspiracy that will hang ’em all!](http://themillenniumreport.com/2018/05/heres-the-proven-deep-state-conspiracy-that-will-hang-em-all/)”
The primary source of information for this website is
[State of the Nation 2012](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/state-of-the-union-2012/), which is another extreme-right conspiracy site that occasionally publishes fake news. Mostly the Millennium Report is a tin foil hat conspiracy website with themes running from Pizzagate, the New World Order to the [Deep State](http://themillenniumreport.com/2018/05/heres-the-proven-deep-state-conspiracy-that-will-hang-em-all/) conspiracy.
During Covid-19, they frequently promoted pseudoscience and conspiracy theories and as of this date 01/25/2023 they have not updated the website in over one year.
