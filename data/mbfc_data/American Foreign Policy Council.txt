Analysis / Bias
In review, AFPC publishes strategic reports and other reports monitoring the policy progress of other countries from a conservative standpoint (particularly Russia, China, countries in the Middle East, and Asia). The website features a section called “publications,” which shows articles published in other publications by AFPC members. Some of the sources they are published in are
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and [The Diplomat](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-diplomat-magazine/). Another section is entitled news and events, which highlight AFPC events.
Editorially, AFPC leans conservative. For example, while they don’t deny
[human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they advocate for free-market approaches for the solutions. When reporting on former President Trump, they offer mixed opinions: [Why the Trump Administration’s Central Asia Strategy Improves Over Its Predecessors](https://www.afpc.org/publications/articles/why-the-trump-administrations-central-asia-strategy-improves-over-its-predecessors), and this critical article [Trump is missing an opportunity in Hong Kong.](https://www.afpc.org/publications/articles/trump-is-missing-an-opportunity-in-hong-kong)
