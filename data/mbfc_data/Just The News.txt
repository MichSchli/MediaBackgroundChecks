History
Founded in February 2020 by
[John Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator)), Just the News is a conservative website that reports political news through podcasts, videos, and textual content. According to their [about page](https://justthenews.com/about-us), “JusttheNews.com is committed to just reporting facts from journalists with a long record of public trust and excellence.”
John Solomon serves as the Editor-in-Chief. Solomon was formerly a journalist with
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), leaving the paper in October 2019. Solomon’s reporting has been described as [conspiratorial](https://www.mediaite.com/news/john-solomon-who-helped-spread-conspiracy-theories-about-ukraine-launching-a-site-devoted-to-facts/) and pro-Trump. Another notable staff is [Sharyl Attkisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharyl_Attkisson), the host of the TV show Full Measure, and David Brody from [CBN News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-broadcasting-network-cbn/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Just the News publishes videos, podcasts, and journalism from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines typically do not utilize emotional language such as this:
[Trump’s campaign sues Wisconsin TV station for airing ‘defamatory’ ad](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/all-things-trump/trump-campaign-sues-wisconsin-tv-station-airing-defamatory-ad). This story is appropriately sourced to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and Priorities.org. Another properly sourced story with little bias is this: [Pentagon invokes the Defense Production Act to make 40 million masks](https://justthenews.com/government/federal-agencies/department-defense-enacting-first-defense-production-act-response-covid).
Editorially, Just the News does not label opinion content, and actually, they don’t produce op-eds; however, in examining story selection, they routinely favor President Trump such as this:
[Trump campaign slaps New York Times with libel suit](https://justthenews.com/government/white-house/trump-campaign-hits-new-york-times-libel-suit) while reporting negatively on Democrats such as this: [Cruz decries ‘dangerous’ Schumer threats against justices, seeks censure](https://justthenews.com/government/congress/cruz-calls-schumers-attack-justices-reprehensible-joins-calls-censure). They have published misinformation during the CoronaVirus outbreak of 2020, as seen below in our failed fact checks section. In general, news reporting is not always factual and holds a moderately strong right-leaning bias.
