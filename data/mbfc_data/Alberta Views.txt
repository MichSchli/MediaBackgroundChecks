Analysis / Bias
In review, Alberta Views publishes long-form journalism with minimal bias, such as this:
[Taking Back the Neighbourhood When sheriffs shut down drug houses](https://albertaviews.ca/taking-back-neighbourhood/). This article is featured in their print publication and, therefore, does not source with hyperlinks; however, information is cited and quoted. For the most part, there is minimal use of loaded language, and the content is well-written. Editorially, Alberta Views does not endorse a political party; however, opinion pieces and story selection tend to lean left, such as this: [Oil Sucks](https://albertaviews.ca/oil-sucks/). This piece promotes environmentalism over the for-profit business of the oil industry.
According to
[The Ryerson Review of Journalism](https://rrj.ca/a-different-alberta-view/), Ezra Levant, founder of [Rebel Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-rebel/), an Alberta-based conservative media company, refers to Alberta Views as an “artsy liberal magazine.”
