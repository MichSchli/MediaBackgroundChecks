In review, Richmond Hill Liberal uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Police make 6th arrest in connection with attack on Elnaz Hajtamiri in Richmond Hill](https://www.therecord.com/local-richmond-hill/news/crime/2023/04/20/police-make-6th-arrest-in-connection-with-attack-on-elnaz-hajtamiri-in-richmond-hill.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
