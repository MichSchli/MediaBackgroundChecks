Analysis / Bias
The current editor of The Dorchester Review is
[C. P. (Chris) Champion;](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-champion-162a5011b/?originalSubdomain=ca) he has previously worked for Premier [Jason Kenney](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-social-studies-curriculum-adviser-calls-inclusion-of-first-nations-perspectives-a-fad-1.5690187) and was also associated with the Right-wing Canadian Alliance party. Champion has been involved in controversies, such as criticizing the inclusion of First Nations perspectives in Alberta classrooms.
Of the dozens reviewed, we focus on two articles. The first article is
[“Update on the Ryerson Fiasco.”](https://www.dorchesterreview.ca/blogs/news/update-on-the-ryerson-fiasco) This piece concerns the recent controversy surrounding the renaming of Ryerson University in Toronto. The article presents a one-sided view of the Ryerson controversy. It strongly defends Egerton Ryerson without adequately addressing the concerns of Indigenous communities and the broader context of reconciliation in Canada. The lack of direct citations further weakens the article’s arguments.
For background,
[Egerton Ryerson](https://foundations.ed.brocku.ca/week07/2/) is a notable figure who played a role in creating the Canadian Indian residential school system. From 1883 to 1996, this system aimed to separate Indigenous children from their culture and religion to assimilate them into Canadian society. The discovery of [unidentified graves](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/post-secondary-names-history-reevaluation-1.6436291) at former residential school locations has sparked new conversations about Ryerson’s legacy and his involvement in establishing this system. In response, Ryerson University has changed its name to Toronto Metropolitan University.
In summary, while the article raises points in defense of Egerton Ryerson, it does so with a notably emotional tone, using emotionally loaded phrases such as “imbecile attack” and “unserious Ryerson discussion” without providing comprehensive evidence or addressing the broader issues at play.
The second article,
[“Keep the ‘British’ in British Columbia,”](https://www.dorchesterreview.ca/blogs/news/h1-class-entry-title-keep-the-british-in-british-columbia-h1-h3-h3) presents a perspective that defends the retention of the term “British” in “British Columbia.” The tone of the article is assertive and, at times, aggressive. The article also makes claims about the motivations and actions of Indigenous activists without providing direct evidence or quotes. For instance, the claim that “Haida Gwaii” was “invented by indigenous activists in the 1980s” is presented without a source. Finally, the piece leans towards a conservative perspective, emphasizing the importance of British heritage in British Columbia and critiquing movements to rename or recontextualize historical names and symbols. The [Toronto Sun ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-sun/)and [The Walrus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-walrus/) are cited as references.
In general, The Dorchester Review presents a conservative perspective on historical and cultural issues, often without providing comprehensive evidence or adequately addressing opposing viewpoints.
