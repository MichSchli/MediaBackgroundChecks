Analysis / Bias
Unity News Network’s primary mission is to promote nationalism and support for Brexit. Story selection often favors the political right and uses strongly loaded words such as this:
[SHOCK REPORTS that Nigel Farage has been BANNED from meeting President TRUMP!](https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk/amp-shock-reports-that-nigel-farage-has-been-banned-from-meeting-president-trump/) and this [Macron RAGES as he BLAMES British people for DESTROYING hopes of United States of Europe!](https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk/macron-rages-as-he-blames-british-people-for-destroying-hopes-of-united-states-of-europe/) When it comes to sourcing, they primarily use quotes and occasionally hyperlinks to media sources. Some of the media sources utilized are [The Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/), [Bloomberg News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and local papers such as Devon Live.
In general, news almost always favors the right, with many articles being
[anti-immigrant](https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk//?s=immigrant) that focuses on their crimes, but not others. The primary theme of this website is Nationalism and British separation from the European Union, with many stories that denigrate the left with loaded emotional wording such as this: [Nicola Sturgeon now PLOTTING with Corbyn, Soubry, Cable & others to SABOTAGE Brexit!](https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk/nicola-sturgeon-now-plotting-with-corbyn-soubry-cable-others-to-sabotage-brexit/)
Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they promoted misleading information such as this
[MHRA Contract for artificial intelligence tool to log cases of Covid 19 ‘adverse drug reactions’](http://web.archive.org/web/20210126192846/https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk/mhra-contract-for-artificial-intelligence/). This story is [misleading](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-side-effects/fact-check-technology-will-be-used-to-support-proactive-vigilance-of-covid-19-vaccination-idUSKBN2862EO). Finally, they also promoted baseless election fraud conspiracies about the 2020 USA Presidential Election [Allegations of US Election Fraud – The Italian Job](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125181025/https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk/allegations-of-us-election-fraud-the-italian-job/). This is not true. They have also reported that the January 6th, 2021, insurrection of the US Capitol was a [false flag](http://web.archive.org/web/20221125181336/https://unitynewsnetwork.co.uk/events-at-the-us-capitol-building-failed-insurrection-plot-or-false-flag/).
