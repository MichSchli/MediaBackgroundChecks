Analysis / Bias
In review, CJR is a magazine and website that covers the news profession and journalism/media. The website typically provides criticism and analysis on the media, including our very own
[website](https://www.cjr.org/innovations/measure-media-bias-partisan.php). CJR typically does not use loaded language in their headlines such as this: [Tracking journalist stoppages at the US border](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/border-journalists-cbp.php). This story is appropriately sourced to the Press Freedom Tracker as well as NBC San Diego.
The website has an entire section dedicated to how the media reports on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) with articles such as this: [As California burns again, news outlets neglect climate change again](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/california_wildfires_2019_climate_change.php). CJR takes the pro-science position that climate change is greatly influenced by humans and is being under-reported, which today has become associated with a left-leaning position. When it comes to politics, they often do not report favorably on former President Donald Trump, such as this: [Six rare images that capture Trump’s TV addiction](https://www.cjr.org/politics/trump-tv-addiction.php). In general, CJR reports factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
