History
The Investor Times is a financial news and information site with a domain registered in
[Andorra](https://whois.domaintools.com/investortimes.com). The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership or provide an about page. However, at the bottom of the website, they describe themselves as “InvestorTimes.com is a privately funded financial publication particularly created for professional and personal investors and intellectually restless individuals.”
Currently, the freedomoutpost.com domain forwards to the Investor Times. The
[Freedom Outpost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-outpost/) was a conservative website that MBFC rated far-right biased in the past.

Analysis / Bias
Investor Times provides stock and bitcoin tickers and financial-related news. Articles and headlines do not contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[U.S. Treasury, and banks discuss regulation of stable cryptocurrencies](https://investortimes.com/u-s-treasury-and-banks-discuss-regulation-of-stable-cryptocurrencies/). This story, like most reviewed, is properly sourced to credible outlets such as the US treasury and [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/).
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they report on politics related to finance, such as this
[Biden’s approval rating in the U.S. falls to lowest since he became president](https://investortimes.com/bidens-approval-rating-in-the-u-s-falls-to-lowest-since-he-became-president/). The article is sourced from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) but features a negative tone toward Joe Biden and his policies “Biden against big corporations.” Investor Times generally holds a right-leaning bias in story selection and produces fact-based content; however, the lack of transparency results in a mostly factual rating.
