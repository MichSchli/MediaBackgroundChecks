Analysis / Bias
In review, Upworthy publishes a wide range of news that they feel is click or upworthy. The primary purpose is to produce content that will go viral. An example of a popular story is this:
[Man pulls off elaborate scheme involving body double to get his overweight cat on an airplane](https://www.upworthy.com/cat-body-double-airplane). While politics is not their main coverage, they do report on political news with a solid left-leaning bias, such as this, [Trump’s unprecedented refugee policy is a huge economic mistake. Here’s why](https://www.upworthy.com/trumps-unprecedented-refugee-policy-is-a-huge-economic-mistake-heres-why) and this [Elizabeth Warren sent dinner to Bernie Sanders’ team and shared some very kind words after his heart surgery](https://www.upworthy.com/elizabeth-warren-sent-dinner-to-bernies-staff-and-had-some-very-kind-words-to-the-senator-after-his-surgery). As can be easily seen, there is a significant difference in wording and tone when covering the right through the use of loaded negative wording, while the left receives “purr words” (kind, praising). Generally, story and editorial selection always favors the left and is reasonably sourced.
