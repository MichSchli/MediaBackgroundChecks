Analysis / Bias
ConsumerLab conducts tests on health, wellness, and nutrition products and reports the results. For example, in 2012, a ConsumerLab.com study on 5-hour Energy drink reported the tested sample contained about 207 mg of caffeine. This is considerably higher than advertising “about as much caffeine as a cup of the leading premium coffee,”
[[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConsumerLab.com#cite_note-51)as the FDA states a cup of coffee usually contains 80–100 mg of caffeine. Further, in 2000, they determined that some ginseng products had pesticides.
The website features an A-Z list of products and supplements that tell the testing results. For example, you can select a supplement such as
[Creatine](https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/review-creatine-bcaas/creatine/) and then browse the product reviews to view the results and efficacy of testing. In general, they are a pro-science website that relies on scientific evidence.
