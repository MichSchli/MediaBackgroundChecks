Analysis / Bias
In review, Faith Panda is a health and homeopathic news blog that occasionally promotes pseudoscience. Many articles detail
[miracle cures](http://www.faithpanda.com/drink-this-miracle-japanese-tea-daily-to-burn-fat-4x-faster-boost-energy-fight-cancer-so-much-more/) through foods and incredible preventative properties that are [not supported by science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/). They also have stories of [miracle cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-faith-healing/) through [prayer](http://www.faithpanda.com/power-of-prayers-doctors-cant-explain-how-woman-regained-her-lost-eyesight-after-praying/). Faith Panda [spreads fear](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) of [GMOs ](http://www.faithpanda.com/we-are-eating-poison-heres-how-to-identify-gmo-tomatoes-in-2-easy-steps/)that is not supported by the consensus of scientists. While there are many articles that contain sound information, such as [advocating for vaccinating children](http://www.faithpanda.com/mom-shares-this-picture-of-her-baby-to-warn-parents-of-the-underlying-danger-they-may-not-be-aware-of/), there are many more that are not scientifically based.
