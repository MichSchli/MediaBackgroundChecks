Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsday publishes a combination of sensationalized local news as well as credible, in-depth journalism. Local headlines are generally mild to moderate in loaded language such as this:
[MTA inspector general investigating ‘smashed’ time clock](https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/mta-time-clocks-1.39478148). National and International news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, Newsday has only
[endorsed](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/) a Republican Presidential candidate one time since 1988. A review of editorials reveals somewhat of a balance between right and left; however, more favor the left in total. In general, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
