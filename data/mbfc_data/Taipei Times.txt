History
[Established on June 15, 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_Times), The Taipei Times is the only printed daily English-language newspaper in Taiwan. [Read our profile on Taiwan media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/taiwan-roc-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Taipei Times is owned by Liberty Times Group, which also publishes a Chinese-language newspaper, the
[Liberty Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/liberty-times-taiwan-bias/), Taiwan’s biggest newspaper by circulation, with a pro– [Taiwan independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_independence_movement) editorial line.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Taipei Times publishes Taiwan News, World News, Business, and Editorials. According to
[Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/taiwan), media independence in Taiwan is on hold as they claim the main threat to media freedom comes from [China](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/), which has been exerting growing economic and political pressure on the Taiwanese media. However, [freedomhouse.org](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/taiwan) indicates Taiwan’s media environment as one of the freest in Asia.
Articles and headlines often use minimally loaded language such as this
[Three alleged Chinese cyberagents held](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2020/12/12/2003748568). However, in this story, like most reviewed, there is a lack of hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, they favor the pro-independence
[Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)](https://www.dpp.org.tw/) while reporting negatively on China such as this [Hong Kongers need help, not pity](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2020/12/12/2003748563).
For example, in this editorial piece,
[The Liberty Times Editorial: Core values lead to the top job](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2023/07/15/2003803198) they openly endorse the DPP with this quote:
The DPP is no longer only a party intent on ushering in reform, but a competitive one. To find the balance between the public will and the party’s core values and push for reform and actualize one’s vision by riding on the public’s support is a lesson that an innovative party seeking to embrace the people cannot afford to forget.
When reporting on the USA, they often rely on the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and report neutrally on USA politics [Biden chooses retired army general Lloyd Austin as secretary of defense](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2020/12/09/2003748414). In general, the Taipei Times holds a left-leaning editorial bias, and news reporting appears to be factual; however, without hyperlinks, it is difficult to verify the sources of information.
