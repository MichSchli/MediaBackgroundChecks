History
Founded in 2004, Discover the Networks (originally Discover the Network) is a website run by the
[David Horowitz Freedom Center](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/david-horowitz-freedom-center/) that focuses on the individuals, groups, and history of groups alleged to be politically left-wing. The David Horowitz Freedom Center is also labeled as an [anti-Islamist propaganda source](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/03/08/searching-sharia-anti-muslim-propaganda-ranks-high-google-search) by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The current editor is David Horowitz and is related to the Questionable [FrontPage Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontpage-magazine/).
According to their
[about page](https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/about), “This website is a “Guide to the Political Left.” It identifies the individuals and organizations that make up the left and also the institutions that fund and sustain the left; it maps the paths through which the left exerts its influence on the larger body politic; it defines the left’s (often hidden) programmatic agendas, and it provides an understanding of the left’s history and ideas.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Discover the Networks is comprised of a search engine for profiles of individuals, organizations, and institutions. The search engine also scans for articles related to their primary causes, such as anti-immigration, anti-socialism, and communism, as well as pro-capitalist and anti-labor unions. Put another way; they support strong Paleoconservatism. Most information focuses on Islam negatively, such as profiling those they believe support terrorism or antisemitism, even US politicians such as
[Keith Ellison](https://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individuals/keith-ellison). The website also features an “In the News” section, which reports negatively on liberals such as this, which links to the questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) [Rev. Al: Dangerous Trump ‘Cult Worshippers’ Running the Govt](https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/08/28/sharpton-its-dangerous-trump-cult-worshippers-are-running-the-government/).
Editorially, Discover the Networks editor David Horowitz has been
[described](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-horowitz) as a driving force of the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and anti-black movements.
