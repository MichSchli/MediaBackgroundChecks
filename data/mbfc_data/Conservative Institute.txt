History
Founded in 2017, The Conservative Institute is Right-leaning news and opinion website. According to its
[mission statement](https://www.conservativeinstitute.org/mission-statement), “The Conservative, Institute exists to provide a platform for well-reasoned, well-written, and well-distributed articles and columns defending conservative values.” They further state, “In a world of endless propaganda, misleading headlines, and shallow content, finding quality news sources is nearly impossible. This problem is especially severe for readers of the conservative persuasion.”
This website also lacks transparency as they do not name authors, and they do not openly disclose ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Conservative Institute publishes news in three categories. First is Breaking News, which typically uses minimal to moderate loaded language in headlines such as this
[Democrats offer to repeal Obamacare tax as spending talks continue: Report](https://www.conservativeinstitute.org/conservative-news/democrats-offer-obamacare-tax.htm). This story is appropriately sourced from [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/). The second category is Political Analysis, which features op-eds from prominent conservatives such as David Limbaugh, [Ben Shapiro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ben-shapiro-bias-rating/), and Michelle Malkin, some of which do not have positive records with fact-checkers. The third category is CI Digest, which appears to be op-eds written by Daniel Vaughan, who is listed as a [columnist](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Daniel-Vaughan/-853553642) for CI, though not on the actual website. Regarding sourcing, we found instances of links to the questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), which has failed numerous fact checks.
When reporting on the science of
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), the CI does not deny human impacts on climate change, but some articles question government-based solutions. In general, the Conservative Institute reports mostly factual with a strong right conservative bias in story selection and editorial positions.
