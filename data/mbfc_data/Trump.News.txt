History
Like most Questionable sources, Trump.News does not have an about page, and the contact page returns a 404 error.
[Whois](http://whois.domaintools.com/trump.news) lists the domain as being purchased in 2015, and all other information is redacted for privacy. News posts on this blog link to either JD Heyes, Mike Adams, or News Editors, and none of them have biographical information listed on the website.
A Google search shows that
[JD Heyers](https://twitter.com/JDHeyes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is the Sr. Correspondent with the Conspiracy/Pseudoscience website [News Target](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-target/). Mike Adams is the founder and owner of [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), which promotes right-wing conspiracies and quackery-level pseudoscience.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Trump.News states on the bottom of their homepage that “Trump.News is a fact-based public education website.” In reviewing the news stories on the website, it would appear they are being ironic.
Trump.News frequently utilizes very strong loaded headlines that always favor the right such as this:
[BOMBSHELL: Hillary Clinton ran weapons into Libya for the Obama administration, while Michael Flynn was targeted because he knew the details](http://trump.news/2019-01-11-bombshell-hillary-clinton-ran-weapons-into-libya-for-the-obama-administration.html). The sources for this story come from the Questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and right-wing conspiracy website Natural News, both of which have terrible track records with [fact-checkers](https://factualsearch.news/#/&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=natural%20news&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact-check).
Another example of the extreme right use of loaded emotional language is this:
[IQ-challenged Democrat Ocasio-Cortez says FACTS don’t matter, only whatever narratives make Leftists feel good](http://trump.news/2019-01-08-democrat-ocasio-cortez-says-facts-dont-matter.html). Again, this is primarily sourced to Natural News.
When not denigrating the left and offering
[praise for former President Trump](http://trump.news/2019-01-11-left-wing-media-tries-to-fact-check-trump-speech-ends-up-confirming-hes-right.html), Trump.News promotes quackery-level [anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) propaganda such as this: [Democrats claim compassion for illegal immigrant children ravaged by sexual predators but do NOTHING to protect American children from vaccine predators](http://trump.news/2019-01-14-democrats-do-nothing-for-american-children-vaccine-predators.html). Trump.News also features a search bar, which leads to the [Good Gopher](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/goodgopher/) search engine, that displays results exclusively from conspiracy, pseudoscience, and highly questionable sources. A search of [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) using Good Gopher directs to News Target with multiple denial articles, such as this: [“Climate change” hoax starting to crumble as scientists admit doom projections were totally wrong.](https://www.newstarget.com/2018-04-28-climate-change-hoax-starting-to-crumble-as-scientists-admit-doom-projections-were-totally-wrong.html)
