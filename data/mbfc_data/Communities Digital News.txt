Analysis / Bias
In review, Communities Digital News (CDN) reports on a variety of news including world and political news. CDN frequently uses very strong emotionally loaded words that denigrate the left, such as this:
[Saving the Republic from the lunatic left.](https://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/saving-republic-from-lunatic-left-108451/) This article does not offer a single source to back any of its many right biased claims, such as “Hillary Clinton, of all the criminally unhinged hypocrites”, and “Two years into his Presidency he is the most successful President of my lifetime.” While this is clearly a highly biased opinion piece it is not labeled as such and instead placed in their world news category. In another article, they promote the conspiracy theory that the Clinton’s are mass murderers: [Clinton body count expands, MSM largely ignores death of Jen Moore](https://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/clinton-body-count-jen-moore-105226/). In this article, they point to the Clinton’s “ [mounting pile of corpses](https://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/politics-deadly-six-degrees-of-clinton-separation-103183/) littering the path to power and riches trod by Bill and Hillary Clinton.” Again, this highly charged conspiracy piece is very light on sourcing and there is zero evidence to support this claim.
In general, all stories favor the right and harshly denigrate the left with very poor sourcing techniques.
