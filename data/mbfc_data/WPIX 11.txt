[5 men injured in shooting outside Brownsville deli: NYPD](https://pix11.com/news/local-news/brooklyn/multiple-people-injured-in-brownsville-shooting-nypd/). Many stories also contain videos from the TV Station.

[A closer look at Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul](https://pix11.com/news/a-closer-look-at-lt-gov-kathy-hochul/). Political reporting is reasonably balanced, covering both sides and avoids using emotional language. In general, they report news factually and with minimal bias.
