Analysis / Bias
The Chronicle Herald has a right-center bias in reporting as many stories
[slightly favor the right](http://thechronicleherald.ca/editorials/1433473-editorial-trudeau-on-tour-makes-for-foggy-ways). When reporting world news, they typically use [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and with national news, they use [Postmedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ottawa-sun/) publications, which lean right.
Opinion and editorial pieces also slightly favor the right and typically are light on sourcing. The Chronicle Herald also had to

Despite that news, reporting is usually accurate and holds a slight conservative bias.
