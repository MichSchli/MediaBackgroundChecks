Analysis / Bias
In examining IndustryWeek’s coverage of manufacturing and reshoring policies under the Biden and Trump administrations, the articles offer a detailed comparison and analysis. The article “
[Biden Tax Credits, Trump Tariffs Together Boost US Manufacturing”](https://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/competitiveness/article/21265596/biden-tax-credits-trump-tariffs-together-boost-us-manufacturing) provides a balanced view, recognizing the impact of Trump’s tariffs, with statements like “The Trump administration’s Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports have reduced America’s dependence on China.” It also highlights Biden’s initiatives, notably the CHIPS Act, which allocated $39 billion in tax credits over ten years, leading to about $150 billion in investments and the creation of 20,000 direct jobs.
Another piece,
[“Biden vs. Trump on Reshoring: A Review, and a Critique,”](https://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/trade/article/21154656/biden-vs-trump-on-reshoring-a-review-and-a-critique) acknowledges Trump’s early successes in reshoring, with a significant increase in reshoring and FDI jobs from 75,000 in 2015 to 193,000 in 2017. However, it critiques his reliance on unpredictable tariffs. Biden’s strategies are also examined, especially the Made in America tax credit, which faces criticism for its complexity, potentially benefiting legal and accounting sectors. Despite a slightly more critical tone towards Biden’s strategies, IndustryWeek maintains a balanced perspective, acknowledging the merits of both administrations’ policies.
