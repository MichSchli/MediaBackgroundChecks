Analysis / Bias
In review, Carolina Public Press conducts investigative journalism on state government and reports on local and state interest news. Reporting is original that often does not use loaded emotional language such as this
[Walmart closure, pandemic worsen struggles in Anson County](https://carolinapublicpress.org/40937/walmart-closure-pandemic-worsen-struggles-in-anson-county-2/). This story like most is properly sourced to local media outlets such as newspapers and government records. They do not typically report on national politics unless it involves NC.
Editorially, Carolina Public Press moderately favors the left such as this
[NC environmental advocates: Trump changes ‘eviscerating’ protections](https://carolinapublicpress.org/37041/nc-environmental-advocates-trump-changes-eviscerating-protections/) and [NC House votes to override budget veto as surprised Democrats cry foul](https://carolinapublicpress.org/29297/nc-house-votes-to-override-budget-veto-as-surprised-democrats-cry-foul/). In general, the news is reported factually and with moderate left-leaning bias.
