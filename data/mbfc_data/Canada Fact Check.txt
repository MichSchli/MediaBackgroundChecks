Analysis / Bias
In review, Canada Fact Check is not a fact-checking website but rather a blog in which Ethan Phillips publishes progressive left editorials. Story selection almost always favors the left and utilizes loaded emotional wording to sway the reader, such as this:
[The dangers of an Andrew Scheer Conservative federal government](https://canadafactcheck.ca/2019/08/04/the-dangers-of-an-andrew-scheer-conservative-federal-government/). This story contains a lot of data, but only one hyperlinked source that does not cover the numerous stats cited.
Editorially, the website is opposed to conservative populism with many articles critical of conservatives, such as this:
[The Ford government’s war against children and women](https://canadafactcheck.ca/2018/10/23/the-ford-governments-war-against-children-and-women/). This story, however, is properly sourced to many credible media outlets. Finally, Ethan Phillips frequently reports favorably on progressive political candidates such as this: [Why Canada needs its own Elizabeth Warren to make corporate power the central issue in the coming federal election](https://canadafactcheck.ca/2019/07/31/why-canada-needs-its-own-elizabeth-warren-to-make-corporate-power-the-central-issue-in-the-coming-federal-election/). In general, Canada Fact Check holds a strong progressive left bias through editorial positions and sometimes does not source information properly.
