Analysis / Bias
The Straits Times, according to its
[WikiPage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times), is sometimes referred to as “the mouthpiece” of the ruling party or at least “mostly pro-government” and “close to the government.” According to [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/singapore), “The government’s Media Development Authority (MDA) compels online news websites covering domestic political issues to register under the Broadcasting Act.” The MDA removes anything it deems to be against “public interest, public order or national harmony” or to offend “good taste or decency.” In other words, there is significant pro-state bias.
