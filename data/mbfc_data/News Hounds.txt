History
Founded in 2004, NewsHounds is a website dedicated to exposing
[Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) in lies and misreporting. According to their [about page](https://www.newshounds.us/about) “Rather than serve as the public’s eyes and ears, Fox and other media conglomerates have become echo chambers for the rich and powerful with whom they have become all too cozy. This blog is an attempt to counter that alarming condition. We believe that a viable democracy depends upon viable media.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Newshounds watches Fox News, follows the website, and then attempts to debunk their claims or point out bias and misinformation. Articles and headlines utilize moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Hegseth And Keane Ignore Trump’s Previous Disrespect For Soldiers To Defend Him Over Atlantic Report](https://www.newshounds.us/hegseth_and_keane_ignore_trump_disrespect_for_soldiers_defend_him_over_atlantic_090420). In the report, they rely on credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and of course, the Fox News video they are reporting on. In general, all reporting favors the left and denigrates the right (Fox News); however, the information is properly sourced but one-sided.
