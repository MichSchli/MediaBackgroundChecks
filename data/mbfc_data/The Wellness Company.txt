Analysis / Bias
Dr. Peter McCullough is listed as part of the Chief Medical Team.
[Dr. McCullough](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vaccine-safety-research-foundation-bias/) has been a controversial figure, particularly in relation to his stance on COVID-19 and vaccines. He has been known for promoting early alternative treatments for COVID-19 and has expressed skepticism about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. [His views have been disputed](https://www.factcheck.org/person/peter-mccullough/) by many in the medical community and have led to criticism and controversy.
In analyzing The Wellness Company (TWC Health), the content strongly focuses on alternative medicine approaches, which can be seen in their promotion of products and services such as the “COVID Vaccine Detox” program. This, along with other offerings like child wellness and heart health solutions, suggests a deviation from mainstream medical practices. They also market a “Z-Stack Formula” while advocating for “medical freedom,” which might indicate a stance that challenges conventional healthcare methods. The involvement of medical professionals like Dr. Peter A. McCullough hurts the credibility of this website.
There is significant evidence that the website promotes disinformation such as this related to vaccine shedding (not real)
[BREAKING: Study confirms the vast majority of Americans have gotten the COVID vaccine via “shedding,” whether they wanted it or not ](https://www.twc.health/blogs/news/breaking-study-confirms-the-vast-majority-of-americans-have-gotten-the-covid-vaccine-via-shedding-whether-they-wanted-it-or-not-1?_pos=4&_sid=cfc467727&_ss=r) (see failed fact check below). The website also claims the conspiracy theory that [Covid-19 is a bioweapon](https://www.twc.health/blogs/news/dr-mccullough-chinas-latest-bioweapon-how-you-can-stay-safe?_pos=5&_psq=mccullough&_ss=e&_v=1.0) and that healthy people who received the vaccine are dying from [Myocarditis](https://www.twc.health/blogs/news/dr-mccullough-healthy-people-are-dying-of-myocarditis?_pos=2&_psq=mccullough&_ss=e&_v=1.0). There is no evidence for either.
In general, The Wellness Company promotes pseudoscientific disinformation often as a way to promote alternative health products. Realistically, this site does not promote wellness but rather pseudoscience that can be harmful to health if proper medical treatments are not sought.
