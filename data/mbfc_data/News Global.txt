History
News Global is a conservative-leaning news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://newsglobal.com/about-us/), “Our team believes that every American deserves access to neutral [news coverage](https://newsglobal.com/category/breaking-news/) that delivers the facts and doesn’t try to sway opinions one way or another. So if you’re a reader who values that kind of fairness in your [news](https://newsglobal.com/category/360-review/) coverage, know that we aim to report with integrity.”
The website lacks transparency as it does not disclose its conservative leanings or name authors, editors, and ownership. The domain is registered with information redacted for privacy.

Funded by / Ownership
News Global lacks transparency as they do not provide ownership information. However, the contact page provides a physical mailing address @
[1985 Henderson Rd STE 1156 Columbus, OH 43220](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pak+Mail/@40.0545541,-83.0736699,56m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88388d84b97e5c39:0xa3e179426055c5b3!8m2!3d40.0545979!4d-83.0736413). This address leads to a strip mall and a company called [Pak Mail](https://www.pakmail.com/mailbox-rental), which provides shipping services and personal and business mailbox rentals. It appears Patriotic Post has rented a mailbox with Pak Mail.
Further, when searching the mailing address, we found several other conservative websites linked to this mailbox rental. This is what we have discovered thus far:
These websites have the same design and appear to be owned by the same company/person. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
News Global does not conduct original reporting. Instead, they curate news from other sources and add conservative commentary. Articles and headlines feature loaded emotional wording such as this
[Biden Begins Slurring During Public Speech](https://newsglobal.com/biden-begins-slurring-during-public-speech/). A biased quote from the article reads: “For whatever reason, Joe Biden organized a rally. A group of idiots was bused in to stand behind him and applaud the fall of the United States.” This story does not provide a source.
Regarding sourcing, most articles do not utilize hyperlinked sourcing which is unacceptable for a web-only publication. In reviewing numerous articles, we found they generally rely on questionable right biased sources such as
[American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/).
Editorially, most stories strongly favor the right, and former President Donald Trump, such as this
[Trump Reportedly Helped Rudy Giuliani During A Breakdown At Mar-A-Lago](https://newsglobal.com/trump-reportedly-helped-rudy-giuliani-during-a-breakdown-at-mar-a-lago/). Our review also found instances of promoting debunked conspiracy theories, such as this [FBI Head Who Led Fake Governor Whitmer Kidnapping Plot Involved In Trump Raid](https://newsglobal.com/fbi-head-who-led-fake-governor-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-involved-in-trump-raid/). In this article, they repeat the claim that the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer was fake because an FBI agent had infiltrated the group and stopped it. [This is false](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/04/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-conspiracy-theory-about-fbi-and-ja/).
Finally, News Global has promoted
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://newsglobal.com/doctors-are-asking-police-to-investigate-mysterious-covid-deaths/). In general, the Patriotic Post is a far-right biased source that promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience that are not rooted in fact.
