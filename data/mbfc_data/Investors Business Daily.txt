History
Founded in 1984 by entrepreneur and stockbroker
[William O’Neil,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O%27Neil) Investors Business Daily (IBD) is a conservative American newspaper and website covering the stock market, international business, finance, and economics. In March 2016, IBD became a weekly publication that focuses more on digital operations. The publication continues to use the Investor’s Business Daily name to publish daily on its website. Although IBD mostly reports economics and finance, they also allow lobbyists and PR reps for right-wing think tanks like the [Heartland Institute](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/) and the [Competitive Enterprise Institute](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/competitive-enterprise-institute/) to write [pseudo-scientific propaganda.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Investors Business Daily primarily reports on economics, markets, and investing. They also report on politics, especially through their
[editorial section](https://www.investors.com/category/politics/editorials/) with an extreme right-wing bias. There is the moderate use of loaded language in their articles that significantly favors the right, such as this: [Democratic Socialism: Who Knew That ‘Free’ Could Cost So Much?](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/democratic-socialism-free/) For the most part, IBD sources its market information from credible mainstream and government websites.
