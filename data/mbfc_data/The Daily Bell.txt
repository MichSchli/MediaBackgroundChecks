Analysis / Bias
In review, the stories on the site are a mixed bag of misleading headlines, rambling writing, and thinly disguised ads. Long on hyperbole, but short on supporting links. TDB also seems to have a personal issue with Mark Zuckerberg, as three out of the ten stories on their main page were about him. Of the stories I read for the review, two stand out as examples of the issues with TDB noted above.
- The story under the headline “Slavery Is Freedom: Submit To The State And Be Free From Terrorism” the authors, simply credited as The Daily Bell staff, begin by briefly discussing the recent terrorist attack in London, then switch a long rant regarding TV licensing in the UK. They then switch to praising Czech President Milo Zeman for his extreme views on gun ownership. While any of these could have been used as a topic by themselves, putting all three in one story made it confusing and hard to follow.
- The story under the headline “Why The Money In Your Bank Account Is Not As Safe As You May Think” the authors, again credited only as The Daily Bell Staff, begin by making several unsubstantiated claims regarding government seizure of people’s bank accounts. The story then switches to a thinly disguised ad for offshore banking in general, and Sovereign Man in particular, a group that offers services for those wishing to move their money into offshore accounts.
The lone standout compared to the other stories on TDB was a personal account by Michael Demas of his time working in Nepal through All Hands Volunteers after the 2015 earthquake. It was well written, thought-provoking, uplifting, and poignant. This diamond among the quartz, however, is the exception on TDB, not the norm.
Overall, for the lack of focus in its stories, the advertising disguised as news, and the nearly nonexistent sourcing, TDB earns a Questionable rating. (D. Kelley 6/11/2017) Updated (04/09/2023)
