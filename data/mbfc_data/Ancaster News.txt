[Ancaster Fair holding gala to celebrate new Agriculture Event Centre](https://www.thespec.com/local-ancaster/news/2022/04/08/ancaster-fair-holding-gala-to-celebrate-new-agriculture-event-centre.html?originator=hamiltonnews.com&showmsg=1). National news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
