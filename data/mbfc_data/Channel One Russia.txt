Analysis / Bias
[1TV](https://www.1tv.ru/about/channel) promotes Russian state interests and, according to Reuters [Channel One, ](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/diplomacy-efforts-step-up-after-russian-strike-ukraine-base-2022-03-14/)“closely follows the Kremlin line.”
The headlines are emotionally loaded in favor of the Kremlin and negative towards the United States. Such as here,
[“Volodymyr Zelensky will send a list of the next weapons needed by Ukraine to the United States”](https://www.1tv.ru/news/2023-02-26/448022-vladimir_zelenskiy_otpravit_v_ssha_spisok_ocherednyh_neobhodimyh_ukraine_vooruzheniy) and [ “Joe Biden and Vladimir Zelensky in St. Michael’s Cathedral talked about new batches of weapons.”](https://www.1tv.ru/news/2023-02-20/447743-dzho_bayden_i_vladimir_zelenskiy_v_mihaylovskom_sobore_govorili_o_novyh_partiyah_vooruzheniy) The article discusses the new arms aid package between Zelensky and Biden. It draws a negative comparison between Biden and former president Trump stating that Trump favors the American people at home and not Ukraine: “Meanwhile, Donald Trump went to Ohio to the site of a large-scale environmental disaster after a train crash with highly toxic chemicals.”
On March 2022, Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel 1,
[interrupted](https://www.businessinsider.com/protestor-interrupts-russian-state-broadcast-shouting-no-war-2022-3) her network’s live broadcast with an Anti-War Sign protesting the war; on the banner, she wrote: “No War” and “They are lying to you here.”
According to
[RFE/RL](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-europe-radio-liberty/), Russia’s media regulator, [Roskomnadzor,](https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-tv-hacked-ukraine-anonymous/31740663.html) forbade media organizations from describing Russia’s unprovoked actions as an invasion or a war, instead insisting they are called “special military operations.” For example, in this article, they glorify the success of the “so called’ Special Operation “ [New examples of the courage of the Russian military who are fighting in the special operation zone.](https://www.1tv.ru/news/issue/2023-02-27/21:00#6)“
In general, Channel One Russia publishes right-leaning pro-government propaganda (censorship) that features conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and false claims, by the government, as evidenced below in failed fact checks.
