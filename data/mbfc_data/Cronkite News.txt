Analysis / Bias
The article “
[Kari Lake, Katie Hobbs and the Incivility of Arizona’s Governor Race”](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/10/21/kari-lake-katie-hobbs-arizona-governor-race-incivility-polarization/) discusses the governor race in Arizona and the rising political polarization. It suggests that Republicans are becoming more conservative and are less willing to reach across the aisle, as supported by data from the [Pew Research Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/) and comments from Lara Schwartz, director of the Project on Civil Discourse at American University in Washington, D.C. The article frames the Republican party as more radical by highlighting the denial of the 2020 election results by significant portions of the party, including notable figures. While the facts may be accurate, the framing and emphasis on certain narratives could influence readers’ perceptions, indicating a slight bias against Republicans. The article cites reputable sources such as [FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/), [PolitiFact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), and Pew Research Center.
The second article, “
[GAO: Rush to build border wall caused harm, damages continued after pause](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/09/07/gao-rush-to-build-border-wall-caused-harm-damages-continued-after-pause/),” is critical of the border wall construction initiated during the [Trump administration](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). The report was prepared at the request of U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona. It focuses on the negative impacts on the environment, wildlife, and cultural sites, as highlighted by the [Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/us-government-accountability-office-gao/) report. The tone and content suggest that the rush to build the wall had detrimental effects that continued even after construction was paused.
In general, Cronkite News is fact-based and holds slightly left-leaning editorial biases.
