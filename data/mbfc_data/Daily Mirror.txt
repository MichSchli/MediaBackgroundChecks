History
[The Daily Mirror](https://www.historic-newspapers.co.uk/old-newspapers/daily-mirror/) is a British Tabloid founded by [Alfred Harmsworth](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095921726) (Lord Northcliffe) in 1903. Initially, the primary audience was women. It was described as a newspaper for [gentlewomen](https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c3cfcd69-517d-3277-bb2d-d8b72afad537); however, it was unsuccessful; therefore, it moved to a broader focus. Its new editor [Hamilton Fyfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Fyfe) converted the paper into a photo-rich format using photojournalism. The paper’s next owner was Alfred Harmsworth’s brother [Harold Sidney Harmsworth](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), 1st Viscount Rothermere, who is also known to be an admirer of Mussolini and supporter of Nazi Germany.
In 1935, Lord Rothermere sold his shares in the newspaper to H. G. Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp, with the paper becoming a left-wing working-class newspaper. In 1951,
[Cecil King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Harmsworth_King) replaced Bartholomew as chairman; however, he was [sacked in 1968](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-1.1165298), when he began using the newspaper to attack the head of the Labour Party, Harold Wilson. Currently, Reach plc is the owner, and [Alison Phillips](https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/alison-phillips/) is the current Editor.

Analysis / Bias
The Daily Mirror uses pictures as the main feature of the story, with the pages mainly covered by photographs. However, they are also known to use
[fake photographs](https://web.archive.org/web/20041012123314/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/14/iraq.abuse.uk/), which caused its editor Piers Morgan to resign. [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) has also revealed that The Daily Mirror used a [misleading stock photo](https://www.theguardian.com/media/photography-blog/2014/apr/17/mirror-weeping-child-picture-lie-lazy-journalism) that misrepresented the story.
In review, The Mirror uses emotionally loaded sensational headlines and oversimplified content such as
[“School sends girl, 5, home in different outfit and asks her to ‘cover her body.”](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/school-sends-girl-5-home-14446913) The source for this story is a Facebook post. Further, the paper has a section called “mums” that also presents sensational headlines such as this: [“Woman goes on romantic holiday with boyfriend – and returns with lesbian love.”](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gran-fell-love-woman-romantic-14438258) When it comes to world news about the USA, they publish articles with emotionally loaded anti-Trump-toned headlines such as [“Donald Trump WON’T be allowed to stay at Buckingham Palace during UK state visit.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-wont-allowed-stay-14512697)” Generally, articles are poorly sourced and written in a “gossip” style. When it comes to British news, again, The Mirror rarely uses hyperlinks to source others.
Politically, The Mirror publishes anti-Brexit articles such as
[“The Brexit Zombies are going to eat this country alive.”](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-zombies-going-eat-country-14554308) While they do [criticize](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-must-back-second-brexit-14440457) the Labor Party, they did endorse them in the last election. Lastly, according to [YouGov.com](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/03/07/how-left-or-right-wing-are-uks-newspapers), its political stance in the UK is known as left of center. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 23% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 44% do not, ranking them #13 in trust of the major UK news providers.
