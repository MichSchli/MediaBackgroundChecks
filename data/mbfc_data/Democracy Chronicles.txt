Analysis / Bias
In review, Democracy Chronicles use emotionally loaded words in their headlines such as
[“Is Trump’s Tax Bill Just Corporate 3 Card Monte?”](https://democracychronicles.org/trumps-tax-bill/) and also in the body of the article “GOP Members of Congress gathered with the ‘Dictator In Chief’ on the White House’s South Lawn, to take a victory lap & ‘Kiss the Ring.’ However, Everyone is mum about the $500B- $1.5T this Bill will cost over 10 years.” Democracy Chronicles’ stance on the [Middle East](https://democracychronicles.org/oh-no-jerusalem/) is [balanced](https://democracychronicles.org/gaza-strip-democracy/) as they portray from both perspectives. Story selection and the [issues](https://democracychronicles.org/american-democracy/) Democracy Chronicles support typically align with the [political left](https://democracychronicles.org/world-democracy-news/). Their articles are thoroughly sourced by utilizing credible sources such as [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [NY Daily News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-daily-news/), [Freedom House](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-house/)“. They generally hold a left-leaning editorial bias and report news mostly factually.
