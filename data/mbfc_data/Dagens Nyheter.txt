Analysis / Bias
Currently,
[Stefan Löfven](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sweden-media-profile/) is the Prime Minister of [Sweden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sweden-media-profile/) and the Center-Left Social Democratic Party leader.
Dagens Nyheter states its editorial position on its about page as
[“DN’s political stance is liberal.”](https://www.dn.se/nyheter/om-dagens-nyheter/) However, [Liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberals_(Sweden)) are considered center-right in Sweden.
In review, Dagens Nyheter’s front page features articles in a flashy tabloid style. Articles are published with bold oversized text, big headlines, and large photos. DN frequently publishes articles with moderately loaded emotional language in their headlines, such as
[“Löfven demands support for the budget – otherwise, he resigns”](https://www.dn.se/sverige/lofven-kraver-stod-for-budgeten-annars-avgar-han/) and [“Swedish police featured in Fox News segment: Filmmaker is a madman](https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/nyheter/swedish-police-featured-in-fox-news-segment-filmmaker-is-a-madman/).” They are critical of the Populist Far-Right, The Sweden Democrats or Swedish Democrats (SD), a populist far-right political party: [“SD continues to portray newborn children as a threat to Sweden.”](https://www.dn.se/sverige/niklas-orrenius-sd-fortsatter-att-utmala-nyfodda-barn-som-hot-mot-sverige/)
Editorially, DN lightly promotes nationalism with stories such as this
[“Quota refugee Peter Wandeka’s first day in Sweden.”](https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kvotflyktingen-peter-wandekas-forsta-dag-i-sverige/) This story characterizes the immigrant experience positively by glorifying the benefits of Sweden. On issues such as climate change, they promote pro-science concern [“Swedish climate policy for forests must be updated.”](https://www.dn.se/debatt/svensk-klimatpolitik-for-skogen-maste-uppdateras/) However, according to [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/), more readership comes from those who identify as [leaning right](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/fact-sheet/news-media-and-political-attitudes-in-sweden/). In general, Dagens Nyheter publishes factual news with a slight right-leaning political bias.
