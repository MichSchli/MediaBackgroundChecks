History
Occupy Yourself is a left-leaning website that publishes credible straight news stories as well as those that would be deemed conspiracy and pseudoscience. According to a
[Whois](http://whois.domaintools.com/occupyyourself.org) search, the domain was purchased in 2011, however, the first articles appear on the website in March 2018. Occupy Yourself does not have an about page nor do they disclose ownership or authorship. In other words there is a complete lack of transparency. They do have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/OccupyYourselfNow/about/?ref=page_internal) that states “Fight Boredom … and Tyranny! Here’s how to occupy yourself. Stand with us in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street protesters and all who follow them.” [See our profile on USA media and ownership.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Occupy Yourself covers news with snippets of news articles that then lead to the full story from another source. They also have a
[Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVs03caOnc8cfzEaYv5u00A), in which they occasionally stream live. News articles on the website favor the progressive left with advocacy for Occupy Wall Street as well as support for Presidential Candidate [Bernie Sanders](https://occupyyourself.org/bernie-sanders-launches-hear-the-bern-podcast/), who describes himself as Democratic Socialist (not to be confused with Socialism).
Headlines and articles contain moderately loaded language such as this:
[Glyphosate Worse than We Could Imagine. “It’s Everywhere”](https://occupyyourself.org/glyphosate-worse-than-we-could-imagine-its-everywhere/). This article comes from the conspiracy site [Global Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-research/) and within the article, they source the conspiracy website [Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) for the scientific content. This is a pseudoscience article that does not align with the [consensus of science](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/08/glyphosate-cause-cancer/). When it comes to the sourcing of information Occupy Yourself utilizes credible sources such as [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and occasionally conspiracy sites such as [21st Century Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/21st-century-wire/). In general, most news stories are factual, though there are occasional stories that fall within the conspiracy and pseudoscience category.
