History
Founded in 1985,
[in response to](https://www.glaad.org/about) “New York Post’s grossly defamatory and sensationalized HIV and AIDS coverage,” GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) is a media advocacy and LGBTQ organization. They state their [mission](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0009215/) is to “amplify the voice of the LGBTQ community by empowering real people to share their stories, holding the media accountable for the words and images they present, and helping grassroots organizations communicate effectively.” GLAAD is based in New York, and [Sarah Kate Ellis](https://www.glaad.org/about/staff/sarahkateellis) is the President and CEO.

Analysis / Bias
In review, GLAAD focuses on improving media coverage of LGBTQ people. They promote global LGBTQ rights through projects such as the Commentator Accountability Project. Through the project, they document pundits who regularly express anti-LGBT bias. Here is an example of
[Tucker Carlson](https://www.glaad.org/gap/tucker-carlson) and Former [President Trump’s](https://www.glaad.org/gap/donald-trump) profiles.
The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association and LGBT activists criticized GLAAD for a close relationship with corporations. In 2011,
[Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) published an [article](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/06/glaad-not-off-the-hook-yet-057324) that states, “GLAAD was one of several liberal-leaning groups supporting AT&T’s bid that had received donations from the telecom giant — in GLAAD’s case $50,000.” As a result of pressure from LGBT media, the head of GLAAD [resigned](https://www.nlgja.org/blog/2011/06/how-the-lgbt-media-toppled-the-head-of-glaad/).
GLAAD’s reporting often contains loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this:
[”Tell Fox News To Stop Perpetuating Myths About Transgender People,”](https://www.glaad.org/action/foxmacys) and this [“Mike Huckabee uses Fox News platform to push ‘religious liberty’ lies.”](https://www.glaad.org/blog/mike-huckabee-uses-fox-news-platform-push-religious-liberty-lies) This story is properly sourced to the [LGBTQ Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lgbtq-nation/). Story selection always favors the left and often focuses on discrimination against LGBTQ, such as this [Message to Trans Youth as the Trans Military Ban Officially Lifts](https://www.glaad.org/blog/message-trans-youth-trans-military-ban-officially-lifts-0).
Editorially, GLAAD routinely denigrates the right and reports favorably on the left “
[GLAAD RESPONDS TO PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN’S NOMINATION OF PETE BUTTIGIEG TO BE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION.”](https://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-responds-president-elect-joe-bidens-nomination-pete-buttigieg-be-secretary) In general, information is presented factually and with a strong left-leaning bias.
