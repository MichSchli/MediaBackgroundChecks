History
[Reading the Pictures](http://www.readingthepictures.org/about/) is a web-based, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) educational and publishing organization dedicated to visual culture, visual literacy, and media literacy by analyzing news, documentary, and social media images. According to their [about page](https://www.readingthepictures.org/about/), “We examine news and media images for meaning, trends, context, and fairness, to impart that appreciation to media consumers and professionals.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Ownership and funding are not clear based on the website, and therefore they lack transparency. Sponsorships appear to generate revenue. Again, this is not made clear without additional effort.
Analysis / Bias
Reading the Pictures is always well-sourced; however, there is a strong use of loaded emotional language such as
[this](http://www.readingthepictures.org/2017/09/disasters-roundup/): “Trump’s hellfire and brimstone and his baiting of N. Korea didn’t play well at the annual meeting of the United Nation’s General Assembly; neither did his inordinate need for attention. Certainly, the photographers made him pay.”
Editorially they tend to capture images that favor a liberal perspective while denigrating conservatives, such as this
[Picturing Vaccination Reluctance Among Conservative Christians](https://www.readingthepictures.org/2021/06/vaccination-christians/). We cannot find any instances of failed fact checks, but there is a lack of transparency; therefore, we cannot rate high for factual reporting.
