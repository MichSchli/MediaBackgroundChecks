History
Founded in 2001 by
[Tom Feeley](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Information_Clearing_House), Information Clearing House is a website with a tagline that reads “News you won’t find on [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) or [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/).” ICH’s primary focus is on advocating for peace and exposing war crimes. The website features counters that show the number of Iraqis slaughtered due to the USA war, the number of USA military personnel sacrificed due to the war, the number of international forces slaughtered in Afghanistan, and a count of the total cost of these wars.
According to their
[about page](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/intent.htm), they freely admit that some of the content on the website may not be true with this disclaimer:
This website does not suggest that it contains the “truth”. The truth is a combination of all information and all facts relating to a topic. It is therefore unachievable (in my opinion) for anyone to say “I know the truth.” If you came to this site in search of “the truth” you will be disappointed. That is also true of CNN, FOX , ABC etc. If you came to gather information you may find it a useful resource.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Information Clearing House does not publish original content but republishes and links to 3rd party news outlets. The focus of the content is related to anti-war advocacy; however, many other topics are covered, some of which fall within the conspiracy or pseudoscience category. For example, they publish stories regarding the 9-11 conspiracy theory that the towers were brought down through a controlled demolition:
[Fire Did Not Cause 3rd Tower’s Collapse on 9/11, New Study Finds](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/52209.htm). This story comes from [Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/architects-engineers-for-9-11-truth/), which we have previously rated as a conspiracy website. Other conspiracy topics promoted are [False Flags](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article43428.htm), [New World Order](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article42908.htm), and [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/).
In general, story selection tends to favor the left, such as this story highlighting the dangers of
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/): [Climate Change Will Shrink US Economy and Kill Thousands, Government Report Warns](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/50659.htm) and this [Did the Marquis de Sade Write This Health Care Bill?](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/47006.htm) The Information Clearing House draws from a wide variety of sources, many of which are credible; however, some are not.
