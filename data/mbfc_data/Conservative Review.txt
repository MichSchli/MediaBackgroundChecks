History
Founded in 2014, Conservative Review claims on its website that they “provide best-in-class analysis and commentary on conservative political speech, votes, positions, and elections.”
[In October 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Review), Conservative Review launched [CRTV](https://get.crtv.com/subscribe/), an online television network with shows by [Mark Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Levin), [Michelle Malkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Malkin), [Steven Crowder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Crowder), [Mark Steyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steyn), [Gavin McInnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_McInnes), Steve Deace, and [Matt Kibbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kibbe). Steyn’s show was canceled in February 2017. Duck Dynasty star [Phil Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Robertson) joined the lineup in October 2017. [Eric Bolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bolling) joined the lineup in the summer of 2018. The Website’s Editor-in-Chief is Mark Levin, who has a poor track record with [facts](http://www.snopes.com/nytimes-wiretap-articles/).
As of 2021, Conservative Review is a news aggregation/curation website and no longer offers CRTV.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website no longer provides original news and opinion content but republishes or links to other media sources. Our review indicates that they relate to mostly right-leaning and questionable sources such as
[The Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/), [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), and [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). The sources they reference have failed numerous fact-checks.
Conservative Review is best known for its
[Liberty Score,](https://www.conservativereview.com/scorecard/) which rates politicians on their conservative voting records. The Liberty Score has been used widely and occasionally to aid in fact-checking.
Editorially, all stories reviewed favor the right, while some denigrate the left. Finally, during the Coronavirus pandemic, they frequently downplayed the virus using misleading wording, calling it a
[“Coronavirus Cult.”](https://www.conservativereview.com/news/horowitz-venezuela-america-cdc-confiscate-property-rights-new-anti-eviction-order/?fbclid=IwAR10NqrqBQ68if2d1nNv5wcyeBJ-sqBJNg0HZm11f58DaNbzv_WT-ZFRlOU) In general, the Liberty Score is a credible source of information referenced by fact-checkers; however, the curated news content usually links to poor sources with right-leaning bias.
