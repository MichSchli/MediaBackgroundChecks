Analysis / Bias
In review, iefimerida.gr publishes articles with minimally loaded emotional language such as
[“Summit: Mitsotakis insists on Greece’s positions in Brussels”](https://www.iefimerida.gr/politiki/tameio-anakampsis-epimenei-mitsotakis-synodo-koryfi) and publishes articles critical of the left opposition Syriza “ [Mr. Tsipras is in danger from… his associates!”](https://www.iefimerida.gr/politiki/o-k-tsipras-kindyneyei-apo-toys-synergates-toy). In comparison, the coverage of center-right PM Mitsotakis is positive in tone [“Mitsotakis from Corfu: Attracting foreign investments is a priority of the government](https://www.iefimerida.gr/politiki/mitsotakis-kerkyra-proteraiotita-xenon-ependyseon).” Iefimerida.gr generally sources through quotes and does not provide hyperlinks.
When covering the USA, such as the Trump Administration, they use a critical tone
[“Coronavirus: Cases rise, President Trump’s popularity plummets.”](https://www.iefimerida.gr/politiki/ipa-koronoios-ta-kroysmata-ayxanontai) They generally hold a right-leaning editorial bias and sometimes do not report news factually.
