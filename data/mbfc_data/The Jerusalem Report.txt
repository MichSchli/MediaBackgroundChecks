[Jerusalem Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-jerusalem-post/). The Jerusalem Post is an English-language daily newspaper based in Jerusalem, Israel. It was founded by Ukrainian-born American immigrant to Palestine, [Gershon Agron](https://www.jpost.com/features/in-thespotlight/this-week-in-history-the-palestine-post-is-established) in 1932, and originally published as the “Palestine Post” and in the British mandate of Palestine. In 1950 it changed its name to The Jerusalem Post.

Funded by / Ownership
The Jerusalem Report is published by the Jerusalem Post. In 1989, the paper was purchased by
[ Hollinger Inc.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conrad-black-through-the-years-1.868133#:~:text=1989,in%20Israel%2C%20for%20%2417%20million.) for $17-million, which Canadian-born British Conservative Conrad Black owned. Conrad Black later was [charged with](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/conrad-black-pardon.html) “swindling his company, Hollinger International, of $60 million.” He was serving a prison sentence; however, in 2019, he was pardoned by President Donald Trump.
Mirkaei Tikshoret Group Ltd, jointly with CanWest, purchased the Jerusalem Post from Hollinger International in 2004 for
[$13.2 million.](https://www.haaretz.com/1.4758288) Later, CanWest [lost](https://web.archive.org/web/20121025041543/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-124755737.html) its 50% share to Mirkaei Tikshoret Group Ltd. The Jerusalem Post is currently owned by [Eli Azur](https://www.jpost.com/israel/the-story-behind-the-headlines), an Israeli businessman through Mirkaei Tikshoret, a Tel Aviv-based media company. Revenue is derived from advertising and a paid [subscription](https://www.jpost.com/landedpages/subscribe.aspx).
Analysis / Bias
Until 1989, the Jerusalem Post’s political leaning was left-leaning as it supported the
[ruling Labor Party](https://www.jpost.com/israel/the-story-behind-the-headlines). After Conrad Black acquired the paper, its political position changed to right-leaning, when Black began hiring conservative journalists and editors. Eli Azur is the current owner of Jerusalem Post, and according to [Ynetnews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ynetnews/), and a [Haaretz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/haaretz/) article, [“Benjamin Netanyahu, the Editor in Chief”](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-benjamin-netanyahu-the-editor-in-chief-1.8537315) in 2017, [Azur gave testimony](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4942634,00.html) regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pressure. Current Editor Yaakov Katz was the former [senior policy advisor](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/yaakov-katz-named-new-post-editor-in-chief-451136) to [Naftali Bennett](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-defence/israels-netanyahu-appoints-far-right-bennett-as-defense-minister-idUSKBN1XI1VZ), the former prime minister and head of the far-right political party, “New Right (Yamina).”
In general, The Jerusalem Report is perhaps a bit more centrist editorially than the Jerusalem Post but still falls within the Right-Center category.
