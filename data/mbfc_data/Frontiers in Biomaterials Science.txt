History
Frontiers in Biomaterials Science is a peer-reviewed open-access journal that covers the field of Biomaterials Science. According to its
[about page](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/biomaterials-science/about), “Frontiers in Biomaterials Science publishes fundamental and applied research probing into the science of biomaterials. This interdisciplinary journal publishes high-impact research not of what is classically defined as biomaterials but of biomaterials science and biomaterials technology, and aims to publish studies which address the current lack of mechanisms and fundamental knowledge of old and new biomaterials at the interface of chemistry, physics, biology, materials science, and biomedical engineering.” [Read our profile on Switzerland’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/switzerland-media-profile/)

[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
However, Frontiers in Biomaterials Science is a credible scientific journal, as we have not found any controversy or significant retractions. Although, Frontiers Media has
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
