History
According to their former
[about page](https://icitizen.com/about-us/), “icitizen is an award-winning polling platform that connects people and decision-makers to do just that – make their community a better place.” Icitizen was originally founded in 2012 and then in January 2016, icitizen was relaunched with a broader vision to help citizens, elected officials, candidates, organizations, schools, and companies strengthen their relationships with one another.
At this time, they no longer have an about page and lack transparency.

Analysis / Bias
In review, iCitizen creates polls on its page to gauge the public on a variety of political issues. They also publish news articles that tend to favor the right such as this
[Republicans scramble to stamp out ‘woke’ political bias, cancel culture in the US military](https://icitizen.com/articles/7bae681a-48be-4d56-bc6d-cfa636b4bc45). This story is sourced from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), which we rate right biased and questionable.
Voting polls are published in community forums and genres. While polls cover a variety of topics, many polls are framed to favor the right such as this: “Based on the open letter from 49 former NASA scientists urging NASA to stop using ‘highly dubious’ claims of co2 causing the climate to warming are you . . .?” The top response confirms a mostly right-leaning audience who appear to reject the consensus of science on the cause of global warming: “No change in my belief that co2 does NOT cause global temp to rise.”
Generally, iCitizen is not a credible pollster as there is no information on the demographics, and anyone can vote in their polls.
