Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/), the media environment in India is threatened by increasing nationalism. India ranks 142th out of 180 countries (2021) on the World Press Freedom Index.
In review, OneIndia publishes stories with minimally loaded headlines such as
[“Want to deepen ties with China to get more leverage in dealings with India: Nepal PM](https://www.oneindia.com/international/want-to-deepen-ties-with-china-to-get-more-leverage-in-dealings-with-india-nepal-pm-2645209.html).” However, many of their articles are sourced through quotes and rarely linked to those sources. OneIndia also utilizes Press Trust of India (PTI) for its international coverage, the largest news agency in India. For National politics, they publish articles [criticizing](https://www.oneindia.com/india/from-maun-mohan-maun-modi-why-india-s-politics-silence-i-2644966.html) right-wing populist current PM Narendra Modi. A sample quote from the article reads: “PM Modi too often goes into a complete ‘silent mode,’ especially when the nation is in any crisis. Otherwise, he speaks a lot, mostly during election rallies.” USA news coverage mostly lean left, such as “ [Russian involvement in US elections: Probe looking at Kushner foreign business contacts](https://www.oneindia.com/international/russian-involvement-us-elections-probe-looking-at-kushner-foreign-business-contacts-2644910.html),” which uses [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) as a source.
