Analysis / Bias
GIS Reports provide analysis of geopolitics and geopolitical trends. Prince Michael of Liechtenstein, founder and Chairman of GIS, also writes articles on current affairs categorized as “Comment,” for example,
[“Making the Free World Prevail.”](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/free-world-prevail/) This article by Prince Michael of Liechtenstein emphasizes the strengths and challenges of free societies. It critiques the West’s internal weaknesses and stresses the importance of traditional Western values, reflecting a conservative and traditionalist bias. The piece combines factual accuracy with subjective interpretations and critiques of Western societies.
Other articles are categorized as “Reports.” We analyzed a report titled “
[The Future of U.S.-Turkey Relations.”](https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/u-s-turkey-relations/) In this report, James Jay Carafano discusses U.S.-Turkey relations under the Biden administration, combining factual reporting with expert opinion. The report leans toward a conservative perspective, evident in phrases like “mitigating malicious Chinese and Russian behavior,” reflecting a traditional Western stance. It also criticizes the Biden administration’s uneven promotion of democracy, aligning with conservative viewpoints. However, the absence of external sources and references impacts objectivity.
Regarding sourcing, we found that many articles link back to previous GIS Reports stories and some to credible outside sources, and some none at all. This inconsistent reliance on external sources reduces their credibility.
Based on our analysis, GIS leans towards a conservative and traditionalist viewpoint, focusing on geopolitical analysis from a perspective that values historical context and traditional Western norms.
