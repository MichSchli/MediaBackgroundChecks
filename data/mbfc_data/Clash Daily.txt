Analysis / Bias
In review, Clash Daily reports on other news stories and adds additional conservative opinions. Headlines often contain loaded emotional language that favors the right such as this
[WTF? Indiana High School Providing E-Learning Due To COVID Is Conducting A ‘Virtual Fire Drill](https://clashdaily.com/2020/08/wtf-indiana-high-school-providing-e-learning-due-to-covid-is-conducting-a-virtual-fire-drill/).’ They also frequently rely on questionable sources such as [Prager U](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/) [Prager U Asks: Would You Feel Safer At A Gun Rights Rally Or An Antifa Protest? (VIDEO)](https://clashdaily.com/2020/08/prager-u-asks-would-you-feel-safer-at-a-gun-rights-rally-or-an-antifa-protest-video/).
Editorially they always favor the right and often promote misinformation, especially concerning coronavirus. For example, Clash Daily has reported that coronavirus is less deadly than the flu despite Covid-19 killing 5 times the average of a typical flu year in only 6 months as of this writing. They also promote Donald Trump through positive reporting such as this:
[STILL WINNING: Trump Upstages DNC Snorefest With This BIG Symbolic Pardon](https://clashdaily.com/2020/08/still-winning-trump-upstages-dnc-snorefest-with-this-big-symbolic-pardon/). Generally, this is a pro-conservative site that is not concerned with evidence in any argument.
