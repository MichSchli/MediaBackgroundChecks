History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/19fortyfive.com), 19fortyfive.com or 1945 is a conservative-leaning website that focuses on defense and USA foreign policy news and analysis. According to their [about page](https://www.19fortyfive.com/about-us/), “We seek to hold no one ideology or opinion in favor. We are a non-partisan, non-factional publication. That means we publish a wide range of analysis, opinion, and reporting that is slanted to the left, right, and center. Accordingly, all of our writers and Contributing Editors come from very different backgrounds, many times disagreeing with one another vigorously.”
The website is
[transparent](https://www.19fortyfive.com/meet-the-team/) as they list writers and the editor as J. Beth Gorton. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
