Analysis / Bias
In review, The History News Network is a platform for historians to write about current events. Headlines often contain minimal bias and explain directly what is in the article to follow, such as this:
[The Myth of the First Thanksgiving is a Buttress of White Nationalism and Needs to Go](http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/173689). Story selection tends to lean left and often denigrates former President Trump, such as this article: [CURING OURSELVES WITH FRED ROGERS,](http://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/154283) which contains this quote “Instead of stressing about Trump’s latest idiocy or the decline of American politics, about which we can do very little, we could try to emulate Mr. Rogers.” In general, the History News Network is fact-based and sourced, with a historical perspective that leans left.
