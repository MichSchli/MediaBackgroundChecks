Founded in 2007 by Rick Bayan an author of three books The New Moderate is a website that purports to be centrist. According to their
[about page](https://newmoderate.com/about/) “I’ve created The New Moderate as a community for centrist thinkers who are fed up with extremist dogma… fed up with feeling excluded from the national debates on politics, culture, and religion… fed up with being fed up! In other words, I’ve created The New Moderate is a community for people like us.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The New Moderate is the blog of Rick Bayan who publishes news and opinions from guests as well as himself. He states in their
[mission](https://newmoderate.com/all-aboard/) “Both the right and the left tend to dismiss moderates as namby-pamby weaklings who can’t summon the courage to take a stand. We moderates must discard this tired stereotype once and for all: we know it takes reason, intellect and more than a little courage to formulate nonpartisan ideas that invariably draw fire from two camps.”
Blog posts and articles tend to favor the left in story selection with articles such as this
[Another Fine Mess: Trump, UkraineGate and the Specter of Impeachment](https://newmoderate.com/2019/10/01/another-fine-mess-trump-ukrainegate-and-the-specter-of-impeachment/). This article does not contain hyperlinked sources. They also report negatively on the progressive left such as this [Yes, We Have No Collusion](https://newmoderate.com/2019/03/27/yes-we-have-no-collusion/). This story is also unsourced. While the New Moderate does appear to be centrist, with a slight favoritism to the left, they poorly source their information which renders them Mixed for factual reporting as they do not produce a lot of content.
