[Hezbollah Mourns Tragic Loss of Explosive Material](https://www.themideastbeast.com/hezbollah-mourns-tragic-loss-of-explosive-material/). They also cover USA politics, poking fun at both sides, such as this against the Trump administration [Trump Promises Palestinians a State if they Attend his Inauguration](https://www.themideastbeast.com/trump-promises-palestinians-a-state-if-they-attend-his-inauguration/) and this against the Democrats [Ocasio-Cortez Admits She Had No Idea Israel Is a Country](https://www.themideastbeast.com/ocasio-cortez-admits-she-had-no-idea-israel-is-a-country/). In general, The Mideast Beast makes it very clear on every page that they are a satire site and, therefore, are not misleading.
