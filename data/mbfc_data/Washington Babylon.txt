Analysis / Bias
In review, while progressive in outlook, the site is
[critical of both Republicans and Democrats](http://washingtonbabylon.com/the-gasping-journalism-industry-clinton-hacks-regurgitate-dnc-lies-that-primary-wasnt-rigged/) alike such as in this [example](http://washingtonbabylon.com/get-smart-donald-trump-is-putins-agent-not-so-fast-hillary-clinton-is/) where the Washington Babylon criticizes both sides: “In short, Hillary was chasing a buck, not selling out her country — which is exactly what Donald Trump has been doing as a global businessman all these years (before becoming president, where he is seeking to maximize Trump family profits now and in the future). Neither is a spy or agent for Russia, Saudi Arabia or even Norway — they are just classic fraudsters, grifters and financial con artists.” The Washington Babylon uses loaded words in their headlines and more stories overall, favor the keft.
