Analysis / Bias
Foreign Policy Journal republishes articles, essays, viewpoints written by activists and academics from a progressive standpoint, such as the articles of Professor Richard A. Falk, American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University,
[“Renaming the 1948 War: Partition, Dispossession, and Fragmentation.”](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2018/03/26/renaming-the-1948-war-partition-dispossession-and-fragmentation/)
In review, their articles cover various topics that range from the environment,
[“Can Architecture Fix Our Health, Minds, Societies, Environment?](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2017/10/24/can-architecture-fix-our-health-minds-societies-environment/)“ to TV documentary critics, [“PBS’s Vietnam Acknowledges Nixon’s Treason.”](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2017/10/13/pbss-vietnam-acknowledges-nixons-treason/) When it comes to economic matters they are not highly critical of the [Trump Administration](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2018/03/24/chinese-investment-in-the-us-is-slumping-but-dont-blame-trump/), but instead are critical of the [overall system](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2018/03/14/more-non-existent-job-growth-reported/) as evidenced by this quote from the article “in the Great Western Democracies, economic policy only serves the hyper-rich and the hyper-powerful. Citizens simply do not count. They are as nothing.“ Foreign Policy Journal also publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience such as [anti-vaxx propaganda](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2018/06/19/how-the-cdc-uses-fear-marketing-to-increase-demand-for-flu-vaccines/) and [9-11 conspiracies](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2018/01/24/spy-court-finds-surveillance-operating-outside-the-law/).
Editorially, Foreign Policy Journal is progressive on international geopolitics, diplomacy, and military matters. When it comes to news analysis they use loaded language both in their headlines and the body of the article such as
[“The Myth of the U.N. Creation of Israel.”](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/10/26/the-myth-of-the-u-n-creation-of-israel/) However, they utilize credible sources such as un.org , avalon.law.yale.edu and [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/).
Overall, when covering political issues Foreign Policy Journal has a far left bias in story selection and we rate them factually Mixed due to promotion of conspiracy theories. (M. Huitsing 3/30/2018) Updated (10/12/2018)
