Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the content, Disntr publishes news articles and opinion pieces that lean conservative. For instance, the article
[“Man Who Co-pastors Megachurch With Wife Joins the Republican Race for President](https://disntr.com/2023/07/24/man-who-co-pastors-megachurch-with-wife-joins-the-republican-race-for-president/)” criticizes Ryan Binkley’s presidential candidacy, questioning his suitability based on his co-pastoring role with his wife. The language used in the article is loaded, and the source used is [The Christian Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-post/) A quote from the article reads, “As a pastor, he is expected to uphold and follow the Scriptures. However, his decision to co-pastor his church with his wife goes against the clearly outlined biblical requirements of pastoral authority.” The author uses loaded language, such as “If he can’t be trusted to lead his congregation with integrity, how can we expect him to lead a nation?”
Another article titled
[“Southern Baptist Leader, Ed Stetzer Marches in ANTIFA/Black Lives Matter Protest in Chicago”](https://disntr.com/2020/06/05/southern-baptist-leader-ed-stetzer-marches-in-antifa-black-lives-matter-protest-in-chicago/) criticizes Ed Stetzer’s participation in the Chicago protests, labeling them “riots brought about by lawless anarchists.” The language shows a clear bias against the protests. While Disntr cites brnow.org as its source, it interprets and presents the information differently, giving the protest a negative connotation.
The article
[“Does the Bible Prove a Young Earth?”](https://disntr.com/2023/04/27/does-the-bible-prove-a-young-earth/) presents a perspective that supports Young Earth Creationism, a belief that the Earth is approx. Six thousand years old, based on biblical genealogies, and supports a strict interpretation of the creation narrative, which contrasts with the [scientific consensus of a 4.54 billion-year-old Earth.](https://www.space.com/24854-how-old-is-earth.html) The article lacks scientific sources, relying instead on biblical interpretation and personal opinion.
The
[“False Teachers of the Day”](https://disntr.com/2023/01/05/false-teacher-of-the-day-55-david-hughes-church-by-the-glades/) section on Disntr critiques various religious leaders, comparing their teachings to the author’s interpretation of biblical teachings. For instance, “False Teacher of the Day #55: David Hughes, Church by the Glades” criticizes Pastor David Hughes for his worship approach and sermon content. The language is emotionally loaded, showing a clear bias against Hughes and his church. A quote from the article reads, “Church by the Glades has also worshiped to a song by a feminist LGBTQ activist who dresses her son as a girl. And recently, they sanitized a foul-mouthed rap song and presented it to God for worship.”
In terms of factuality, Disntr’s content is mixed. While some articles are based on factual events, the author’s personal beliefs and biases heavily influence the interpretation and presentation of these events. The website does not consistently provide hyperlinks to external sources to support the claims made, and when sources are provided, the interpretation of the source material can be biased.
Failed Fact Checks
- None by a third-party fact-checker. They routinely promote pseudo-science.
In conclusion, we rate Disntr as Right Biased and Questionable based on a lack of transparency, poor sourcing, and the promotion of pseudoscience. (M. Huitsing 07/26/2023)
