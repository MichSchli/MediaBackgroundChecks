Analysis / Bias
In review, Psyche provides long, and short-form journalism focused on science, philosophy, and culture. Psyche is organized into
[three sections.](https://psyche.co/therapeia) These are Therapeia, Eudaimonia, and Poiesis. Psyche also provides video documentaries.
Articles and headlines often are not political and do not use loaded language such as
[“What luck in war reveals about the role of chance in life”](https://psyche.co/ideas/what-luck-in-war-reveals-about-the-role-of-chance-in-life) and [“Homeless, delusional, and brave, Mrs A taught me a powerful lesson.”](https://psyche.co/ideas/homeless-delusional-and-brave-mrs-a-taught-me-a-powerful-lesson) However, a quote from the essay favors a progressive-liberal perspective, “Yet in 2020, the entrepreneur Elon Musk Tweeted …If you work hard enough, luck stops being a factor. But there are no guarantees.’” Another quote from the second article, “It is no longer breaking news that inequalities in healthcare for Black people are deeply entrenched in the US health system.” Both of these indicate a left-leaning bias.
When it comes to sourcing, Psyche references Aeon, as well as pro-science sources such as
[ScienceDirect](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sciencedirect/), and credible sources such as rintintin.colorado.edu, press.princeton.edu, and [pnas.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-of-the-united-states-of-america-pnas/). In general, Psyche is fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
