Analysis / Bias
The Huntsville Times covers local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this
[North Alabama man acquitted of capital murder in 2019 slaying](https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2022/12/north-alabama-man-acquitted-of-capital-murder-in-2019-slaying.html). National and international news is covered through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they have a slight right-leaning bias and employ known right-leaning columnists, such as Cameron Smith, Vice President of the
[R Street Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/r-street-institute/), a conservative and libertarian think tank based in Washington, D.C. They generally report the news factually and with a moderate conservative bias.
