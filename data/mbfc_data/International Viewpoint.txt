Analysis / Bias
In review, International Viewpoint publishes articles, debates, reports, and analyses from a Marxist perspective. They frequently use loaded language in their headlines and in the body of the article, such as
[“Empire and the Middle East in the age of Trump.”](http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article5298) International Viewpoint uses left-biased and other socialist sources such as [Counterpunch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/counterpunch/) and [International Socialist Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Socialist_Organization). However, some articles do not source at all or provide supporting links.
They have authors from
[several countries](http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?auteur1547), and they republish or translate articles from across the world written by activists from a progressive, anti-capitalist standpoint.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years
Overall, International Viewpoint has a far-left bias in story selection when covering political issues, and we rate them factually mixed due to extreme views and poor sourcing. (M. Huitsing 03/13/2018) Updated (01/14/2022)
