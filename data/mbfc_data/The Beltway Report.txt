Analysis / Bias
In review, The Beltway Report publishes news and opinions from a conservative perspective. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language in headlines such as this
[President Trump Crushes ‘Mini-Mike’ After Bloomberg Attacks Church Hero, Talks Down To American Citizens [Opinion]](https://www.thebeltwayreport.com/2020/01/president-trump-crushes-mini-mike-after-bloomberg-attacks-church-hero-talks-down-to-american-citizens-opinion/). This opinion piece is appropriately labeled as an opinion and sourced to outside links such as [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), and the questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
A review of several articles indicates the use of poor sources such as the
[Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and [Patriot Crier](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/patriot-crier/). While The Beltway Report uses credible sources, they often resort to poor sources, as indicated above.
Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left with stories such as this:
[Disgraced Pelosi Busted For Lying On The Floor Of The House About Transcript of President Trump’s Phone Call to Zelensky](https://www.thebeltwayreport.com/2020/01/disgraced-busted-for-lying-on-the-floor-of-the-house-about-transcript-of-president-trumps-phone-call-to-zelensky-video/). They also frequently glorify the former Trump administration with stories like this: [Opinion| ‘Trump Curse’ Strikes Again! After Red Sox Manager Trashes Trump, Alex Cora Gets Suspended](https://www.thebeltwayreport.com/2020/01/opinion-trump-curse-strikes-again-after-red-sox-manager-trashes-trump-alex-cora-gets-suspended/). In general, this far right-wing website promotes Pro-Trump propaganda and frequently utilizes poor sources who routinely fail fact checks.
