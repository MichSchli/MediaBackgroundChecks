Analysis / Bias
Throughout much of the last 90 years, the San Diego Union-Tribune has been a conservative paper that frequently endorsed Republican candidates or simply refused to cover Democratic candidates at all. When the paper was purchased by the
[Tribune Publishing Company](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tribune-news-service/) in 2015 the paper moved leftward toward the center. Then in 2018, when the paper was bought by [Patrick Soon-Shiong](https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/21/trump-soon-shiong/), who is a Democratic donor, the paper moved slightly left in editorial direction.
In review, The San Diego Union-Tribune does not use loaded language in news reporting, and all information is properly sourced. Editorially, there is a
[slight left-leaning bias](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/editorials/sd-mail-bomb-suspect-arrested-20181026-story.html); however, all perspectives are given a voice, and therefore, we classify this paper on the left side of least biased.
