[Mostaqbal Watn](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-election/pro-sisi-party-set-to-lock-in-control-as-egypt-heads-to-polls-idUSKBN277227) (Nations Future), known as “the party of the president,” is a big tent populist-nationalist-secularist militarist party that fully supports authoritarian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Reporters Without Borders has [reported](https://rsf.org/en/iran) Egypt as “One of the world’s biggest jailers of journalists” According to a Reporters Without Borders 2021 report, Egypt ranks 166 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
In review, MENA publishes news with neutral headlines such as
[“Presidential decree extends security measures in Sinai for 6 more months”](https://www.mena.org.eg/en/news/dbcall/table/textnews/id/9500796) and [“President Sisi meets with the leaders of the armed forces on the occasion of the anniversary of the victories of the tenth of Ramadan.”](https://www.mena.org.eg/ar/news/dbcall/table/webnews/id/9523608) They heavily quote or utilize factually mixed sources when it comes to sourcing. In general, Middle East News Agency (MENA) is a right-leaning pro-Government propaganda outlet that omits news not favorable to President al-Sisi but reports factually on the news they choose to report.
