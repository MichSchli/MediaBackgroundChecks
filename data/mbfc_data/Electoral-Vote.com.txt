Analysis / Bias
Electoral-Vote.com’s primary mission is to compile election polling data and combine them to create statistical averages through their methodology. They use a combination of local state polling and national polls to formulate their numbers.
Electoral-Vote.com also reports news with a strong left-wing bias. Most stories favor the left through wording and story selection, such as this:
[This Week’s Swamp News: Zinke Is in Trouble](http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Jun24.html#item-5). Electoral-Vote.com typically sources all of its information from credible sources such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), and the [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) Further, a [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=electoral-vote.com&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have never failed a fact check.
