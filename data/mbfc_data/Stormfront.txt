History
Founded in 1996, Stormfront is a forum, and blog that produces racist content. From their website: “We are a community of racial realists and idealists. We are White Nationalists who support true diversity and a homeland for all peoples. Thousands of organizations promote the interests, values, and heritage of non-White minorities. We promote ours. We are the voice of the new, embattled White minority!” We try to be objective in our reviews of sources, but in this case, it is not possible.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the forum promotes hate in many forms, from racism, antisemitism to Islamophobia. According to the
[Southern Poverty Law Center,](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/stormfront) “its registered users have been behind almost 100 murders.” This is perhaps the vilest website and organization in existence.
