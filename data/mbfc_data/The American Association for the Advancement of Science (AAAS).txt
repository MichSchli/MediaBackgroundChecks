AAAS always supports the consensus of science. For example, in 2006, they
[wrote](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/s3fs-public/aaas_climate_statement_0.pdf), “The scientific evidence is clear: global [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society…The pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years. The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.”
