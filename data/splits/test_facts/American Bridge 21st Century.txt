American Bridge 21st Century is a liberal American Super PAC that supports Democratic candidates and opposes Republican candidates. It was founded by David Brock in 2010 and is associated with Media Matters for America. It is an opposition research hub for the Democratic Party. The group physically tracks and monitors Republican candidates and officials and uses social media to deploy its findings. Democratic donors and labor unions fund American Bridge. During the 2012 and 2014 election cycles, Billionaire George Soros was the largest donor, donating more than 2 million dollars. The website also solicits donations from visitors. In review, the primary objective of American Bridge is to perform opposition research. This is done by having “trackers” follow and record Republican candidates across the country. These trackers employ high-tech recording gear in the hope of capturing Republicans in embarrassing moments. The website also reports news with moderately loaded language. Overall, we rate American Bridge 21st Century Left Biased based on advocacy and support for the Democratic Party and Mixed for factual reporting due to three failed fact checks. (D.
