History
[Founded](https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/nov/21/nikkei-japan) in 2013 by Japanese media corporation [Nikkei](http://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/about/), Nikkei Asian Review is an English language business journal and website which focuses on news, economy, business, markets, trends, and international affairs across the Asian region. Nikkei Asian Review is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Former [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/) editor [Gwen Robinson](https://www.global-nikkei.com/asia3hp/speakers/moderators03.html) is Chief Editor of the Nikkei Asian Review. In 2015, Nikkei purchased the Financial Times from Britain’s Pearson, a UK business newspaper, paying $1.3 billion. Thus Nikkei Asian Review became FT’s sister publication. According to their [about page](https://asia.nikkei.com/about), “As content partners, the Nikkei Asian Review and the FT share select articles with their respective audiences and collaborate editorially on joint projects.” [Read our profiles on Japan’s media and government](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/japan-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Nikkei is known for its
[conservative views](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/23/fts-new-owners-nikkei-are-cut-from-the-same-template). According to the [Japan Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/japan-times/), it is often [criticized](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/24/business/corporate-business/nikkei-buys-financial-times-1-3-billion-deal/#.XNrFu45KiUk) by “depending too much on leaks — apparently provided by corporate insiders — and the paper is often seen as reluctant to criticize Japanese firms bluntly.” Further, Niemanlab [quotes](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/newsonomics-eight-questions-and-answers-about-nikkeis-surprise-purchase-of-the-ft/) [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) reporter [Hiroko Tabuchi](https://twitter.com/hirokotabuchi/status/624228350958043137) after the Nikkei purchase the FT “Worrying. Nikkei is basically a PR machine for Japanese biz; it initially ignored the 2011 Olympus accounting scandal (which FT broke). Nikkei has also hardly covered the Takata airbag defect; almost no investigative work on that issue whatsoever. Nikkei is Japan Inc.”
When covering news geared towards Southeast Asian countries, Nikkei Asian Review utilizes minimally loaded emotional language such as this:
[“Prayuth close to securing Thai PM job as king backs senate”](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Thai-election/Prayuth-close-to-securing-Thai-PM-job-as-king-backs-senate) and [“Japan venture specialist to launch $27m fund for India startups”](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Japan-venture-specialist-to-launch-27m-fund-for-India-startups), however, information is not sourced through hyperlinking.
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they use loaded language such as this quote from an
[article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Trump-versus-Abe-the-trade-end-game) that reads, “The Abe-Trump summit in Washington in late April showed how Trump has driven U.S. trade policy into a dead end.” Once again, there is a lack of hyperlinked sourcing.
