Analysis / Bias
In review, Citizen Critics publishes articles with loaded headlines and content such as: “
[Betsy DeVos’s Educational Trumpism](https://citizencritics.org/2017/01/betsy-devoss-educational-trumpism/).” Citizen Critics utilizes mostly credible sources such as [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), [NY Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), and [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/), as well as less known sources such as freetochoose.tv and tandfonline.com. Story selection almost always favors the left, such as this: [Trump’s Rhetorical Stonewalling Strategy](https://citizencritics.org/2019/05/trumps-rhetorical-stonewalling-strategy/). This story is appropriately sourced to [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), and the [New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/). Generally, reporting is factual with a moderate left-leaning bias in story selection.
