History
According to their
[about page](https://www.lifesitenews.com/about), LifeSiteNews “is a non-profit Internet service dedicated to issues of culture, life, and family.” The [Campaign Life Coalition](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/campaign-life-coalition/) founded the website, a Canadian political lobbyist organization founded in 1978. From Toronto, the organization [advocates for socially conservative values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_Life_Coalition#LifeSiteNews). In addition to its initial goals of passing restrictions on abortion and euthanasia, Campaign Life Coalition advocates for what it describes as traditional family values, including opposition to same-sex marriage and age-inappropriate sex education.

Analysis / Bias
In review, LifeSiteNews primarily reports on
[anti-abortion](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pro-life-john-kasich-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-on-babies-with-beating-h), [anti-gay marriage](https://www.lifesitenews.com/tags/tag/same-sex+'marriage'), and pro-Evangelical Christian issues. An example of a pro-Christian story is why [ being Christian means traveling with Jesus from Bethlehem to Calvary.](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/why-being-christian-means-traveling-with-jesus-from-bethlehem-to-calvary) LifeSiteNews also has a favorable opinion of former President Trump, as evidenced by this piece: [How Trump brought Christmas back to America.](https://www.lifesitenews.com/archives/search) Editorially, every story is right-leaning, including [this story](https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/pro-abortion-mainstream-media-has-more-influence-on-american-voters-than-ru) that sources non-credible sources such as [Rush Limbaugh](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/) and [CNSNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/).
Scientifically, they often promote false or misleading information related to Planned Parenthood, abortion, and Covid-19 (see failed fact checks below). In general, story selection favors the Christian right and denigrates the left while consistently not being factual in reporting.
