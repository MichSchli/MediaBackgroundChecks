Analysis / Bias
TVN covers certain aspects of historical events or photos, with many about the entertainment industry. Articles and headlines use somewhat loaded wording to create interest in the topic, such as
[The Bizarre and Unappetizing Buddhist Monk Practice of Self-Mummification](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/04/25/selfmummification/?D2c=1). This story, like others, is light on sourcing information.
Editorially, they do not produce opinion pieces but cover historical politicians and events with minimal bias, such as this
[National Archives Releases 1500 Previously Classified Documents On The John F. Kennedy Assassination](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2021/12/16/national-archives-releases-1500-previously-classified-documents-on-the-john-f-kennedy-assassination/). In general, The Vintage News is low-biased but does not always source information, making verifying facts difficult. However, we cannot find any intentional misinformation on this site.
