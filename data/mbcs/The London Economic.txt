Analysis / Bias
In review, The London Economic has a strong left-wing bias in story selection that always favors the left. They consistently use loaded headlines such as
[Leaked list of Conservative Party sex pest sleaze published, shaming THIRTY SIX current Tory MPs](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/leaked-list-of-conservative-party-sex-pest-sleaze-published-shaming-thirty-six-current-tory-mps/30/10/) and this [Boris Johnson turns into The Joker in new artwork](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/boris-johnson-turns-into-the-joker-in-new-artwork/11/10/). While The London Economic mentions their source in articles, they do not provide hyperlinks for further verification of information, which leads to articles being spun and taken out of context.
Editorially, there is consistent liberal bias such as this
[The Conservatives are taking a sledge hammer to their voter base](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/opinion/the-conservatives-are-taking-a-sledge-hammer-to-their-voter-base/02/10/), and this [Labour is the only party treating both sides of the Brexit divide with respect](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/opinion/labour-is-the-only-party-treating-both-sides-of-the-brexit-divide-with-respect/17/09/). In general, news reporting is mostly factual, but lacks hyperlinked sourcing, while editorial positions always favor the left.
