History
[CNS News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNSNews.com), formerly known as Cybercast News Service, was founded in 1998 by [L. Brent Bozell III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Brent_Bozell_III), who is the nephew of [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/) founder William F. Buckley Jr. CNS News is owned by [Media Research Center (MRC](https://www.mrc.org/about)), which is a conservative content analysis organization based in Virginia, founded in 1987 by L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a conservative columnist and author of four books; however, according to a [Daily Beast ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) [article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-employees-of-conservative-figure-l-brent-bozell-say-he-didnt-write-his-books-or-columns), former employees claim that Bozell uses [Tim Graham](http://archive.mrc.org/bios/graham/welcome.asp), Director of Media Analysis, as his ghostwriter. As a result, according to a [Slate ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/) [article,](http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/02/18/newspaper_drops_brent_bozell_column_because_bozell_wasn_t_writing_it.html) the Quad-City Times (Iowa) dropped Bozell’s column.
Media Research Center (MRC) states its
[mission is ](https://www.mrc.org/about)“to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left.” [CNS News](https://www.cnsnews.com/about-us) describes itself as a news source “for individuals, news organizations and broadcasters who put a higher premium on balance than spin and seek news that’s ignored or under-reported as a result of media bias by omission.”
Terry Jeffery is Editor-In-Chief of CNS News, and a complete list of staff for their parent company MRC can be found
[here,](https://www.mrc.org/staff) though some names were left off. For example, the [Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/) states that [Rebekah Mercer](https://www.heritage.org/staff/rebekah-mercer) serves on the board of Media Research Center. Rebekah Mercer is the daughter of right-wing philanthropist Robert Mercer who heavily funded the Trump Campaign.

Funded by / Ownership
CNS News’ parent company is a conservative media watchdog called Media Research Center (MRC). According to
[charitynavigator.org](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4062) ratings, Media Research Center (MRC) was awarded an overall 2/4 star rating and a 1 Star financial rating. A [Politico ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) [article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/26/the-deep-roots-trumps-war-on-the-press-218105) states that Bozell keeps the wealthy donor that helped start up the Media Research Center secret. To this day, that donor is still unknown.
According to
[Sourcewatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Media_Research_Center#cite_note-8), Media Research Center’s top donors are “Exxon Mobil and The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Inc. The foundation donated $1.65 million to Media Research Center between 2001 and 2010.” Further, [Desmog Blog](https://www.desmogblog.com/media-research-center) reports that “according to publicly available 990 forms, the MRC has received over $4.1 million from the oil money-backed Scaife Family and $7,494,000 from the Mercer Family Foundation.” [Public Integrity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-public-integrity/) [reports](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/10/07/20307/reclusive-mega-donor-fueling-donald-trumps-white-house-hopes) that “Mercer has heavily funded ultra-conservative media outlets, such as [Breitbart News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and Brent Bozell’s [Media Research Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-research-center-mrc/).” The website is funded through donations and online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, CNS News consistently publishes news that favors the right and denigrates the left. Headlines and articles typically use moderately loaded wording such as this:
[Patrick Buchanan: Has the West the Will to Survive?](https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/patrick-j-buchanan/has-west-will-survive). Within this article, there is not a single link to an external source to support Mr. Buchanan’s commentary. Further, Pat Buchanan has a [mixed track record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/pat-buchanan/statements/?list=speaker) with fact-checkers.
In another article, they use questionable language when referring to liberals/welfare recipients as
[thugs](https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/michelle-malkin/stimulus-slush-fund-housing-entitlement-thugs). News stories also typically offer [limited sourcing](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/venezuela-says-un-human-rights-council-can-now-operate-without-us), with most hyperlinks directing back to older CNS stories. Editorially, CNS News advocates for a [free market](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/economists-say-bush-chucked-free-market-principles-long-financial-crisis) with limited regulations and the promotion of human-influenced [climate change denialism](https://www.cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/eric-scheiner/live-heartland-institutes-9th-international-conference-climate-change), as evidenced by their support for the [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/), a [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) think tank funded by the fossil fuel industry.
