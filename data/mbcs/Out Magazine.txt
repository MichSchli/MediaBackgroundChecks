Analysis / Bias
In review, Out publishes stories about gay culture and lifestyle and news and entertainment. The content is original, and often sourced from interviews and credible media outlets. Out clearly labels opinion pieces as Commentary and news by category, such as this in the Politics section:
[A Patchwork of Anti-Discrimination Laws Don’t Protect LGBTQ+ Workers](https://www.out.com/commentary/2019/8/28/patchwork-anti-discrimination-laws-dont-protect-lgbtq-workers), and this one from the fashion category: [Karl Lagerfeld, Designer of Chanel and Fendi, Dead at 85](https://www.out.com/fashion/2019/2/19/karl-lagerfeld-designer-chanel-and-fendi-dead-85). They also republish stories that are carried in The Advocate. A sourcing review demonstrates appropriate sources such as [Ballotpedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ballotpedia/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), and the [Human Rights Campaign](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-campaign/).
Editorially, Out advocates for LGBTQ rights as well as liberal politicians who support their cause, such as this:
[These Hate Groups Want the Supreme Court to Erase Trans People](https://www.out.com/commentary/2019/8/28/these-hate-groups-want-supreme-court-erase-trans-people), and: [Bernie Sanders Bravely Asks Us to Consider a Straight President](https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2019/2/19/bernie-sanders-bravely-asks-us-consider-straight-president). They also do not have a positive opinion regarding conservatives and former President Donald Trump: [SPLC’s Trump Report Shows ‘Profoundly Negative Impact’ on Students at Schools](https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2016/11/29/splcs-trump-report-shows-profoundly-negative-impact-students-schools). Generally, reporting is factual, with story selection heavily favoring the left.
