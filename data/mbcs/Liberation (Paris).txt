History
Launched in 1973, Libération or Libé is an iconic daily newspaper based in Paris, France. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and Journalist Serge July are the founders of the paper. The editorial stance was known as extreme
[left](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/business/media/liberation-covering-a-civil-war-its-own.html) in the paper’s early days and co-owned by all the staff, with all staff members receiving the same salary, including the chief editor Serge July.
In recent years’ shrinking readership has plunged the newspaper into significant financial difficulties. In 2014, its two owners, businessman
[Edouard de Rothschild and real estate developer Bruno Ledoux](https://www.france24.com/en/20140213-iconic-french-newspaper-liberation-crisis-editor-steps-down) made several proposals to solve the financial problems. These included a restructuring plan, such as using the newspaper’s offices in Paris as a cultural center featuring a cafe and TV studio, salary cuts, and a paywall. The Libération’s journalists rejected the proposals by stating, “this is a real coup by the shareholders against Libération, its history, its team, its values.” They went on strike for a day, and the issue was resolved. According to a [Le Monde](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/le-monde-bias/) article, [“The rescue of “Liberation” in 2014 at the heart of a judicial investigation,”](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2022/09/20/le-sauvetage-de-liberation-en-2014-au-c-ur-d-une-enquete-judiciaire_6142398_4355770.html) this operation, as of 2022, is still under investigation for tax evasion.
In 2016 telecommunications magnate
[Patrick Drahi](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148696/liberation) incorporated the paper into his mobile communications company. In 2022, the owner of [Elle magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/elle-magazine/) and part-owner of the daily Le Monde [Czech billionaire businessman Daniel Kretinsky](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20220921-french-newspaper-lib%C3%A9ration-gets-%E2%82%AC15m-bailout-from-czech-businessman) agreed to “ lend Libération 14 million euros to help stem losses until its projected breakeven in 2026.” [Read our profile on France’s Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review,
[Libération](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148696/liberation) editorially holds left-centrist views; however, their reports are balanced. Libération publishes fact checks and is [a registered](https://credibilitycoalition.org/credcatalog/project/liberation---checknews/) fact checker of the IFCN. Fact checks are found under the CheckNews section of Libération. For example, in this article, they fact-checked the statement made by Jordan Bardella, the acting president of the populist far-right party National Rally (RN) [“Is it true that French retirees live on 8 euros a day while foreigners receive 950 euros without having contributed?](https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/est-il-vrai-que-des-retraites-francais-vivent-avec-8-euros-par-jour-pendant-que-des-etrangers-percoivent-950-euros-sans-avoir-cotise-20220923_OTFVBCL7NZBEFPTJG5MI6FYLFQ/)” Liberation reports the comparison is misleading. They also report on the environment, particularly climate change, such as [“Glaciers, permafrost, corals… Points of no return threaten to be reached sooner than expected.”](https://www.liberation.fr/environnement/climat/glaciers-permafrost-coraux-des-points-de-non-retour-menacent-detre-atteints-plus-tot-que-prevu-20220909_T7LTRJSHR5CYNGPWBA2H2MHDZE/)
Articles are typically sourced through quotes or hyperlinked from credible sources such as

Here is another article sourcing the [AFP ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/)(Agence France Presse) [“Nobel Peace Prize 2022: “The Ukrainian people are the main peacemakers today.”](https://www.liberation.fr/international/prix-nobel-de-la-paix-2022-le-peuple-ukrainien-est-aujourdhui-le-principal-artisan-de-la-paix-20221007_ZYLCI2MWDJCQFBBIDV5PLHWSSQ/) They also have a positive tone towards President Biden, such as in this article, [“Joe Biden takes a small step, unfortunately, unimaginable in France.”](https://www.liberation.fr/politique/fin-de-la-prohibition-du-cannabis-joe-biden-fait-un-petit-pas-helas-inimaginable-en-france-20221007_3VGPD4QCFZD4VFUXR3UFCJ2KSA/)
In general, Libération reports news factually and uses various credible sources; however, they promote liberal positions on most issues editorially.
