History
Founded in 2019, Gen Z Conservative is an anonymously run blog that publishes news and opinion from a conservative perspective. The author’s political philosophy was
[described](https://genzconservative.com/about-me-a-gen-z-conservative/) as “I am a traditional conservative because I believe that balancing fiscal conservatism, respect for heritage and tradition, and respect for individual liberty is the best path forward for America. I think all three of those ideologies contain viewpoints that would be beneficial for America. However, I think complete attachment to any one of them would be a weaker position than combining the best aspects of all three.”
The website lacks transparency as ownership and authors are not disclosed.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Gen Z Conservative publishes news and commentary from a conservative perspective. An anonymous author writes some stories, and others are republished from other sources. Original material frequently utilizes loaded emotional language that denigrates the left, such as this
[Blue State Hypocrisy: 15 Democrats Who Don’t Follow Their Own Rules](https://genzconservative.com/blue-state-hypocrisy/). A loaded quote from the article reads, “The Democrat hypocrites create stricter and stricter rules to deal with the phantom menace of Covid but then refuse to follow those rules themselves.” When sourcing their information, they often use poor sources such as [Just The News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), and [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/). At the same time, at other times, they reference conspiracy sites such as the highly discredited [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which routinely fails fact checks.
In 2022, Gen Z Conservative frequently downplayed the severity of Covid-19 through the publication of misinformation such as this
[All Americans Should Celebrate Thanksgiving Despite Covid](https://genzconservative.com/celebrate-thanksgiving-despite-covid/). This article states, “Far from encouraging you to risk that ~99.7% survival rate and celebrate Thanksgiving despite Covid, they’re demanding that you instead continue to quarantine and remain at home.” Gen Z Conservative did not provide a source for this claim; therefore, we assume they are using misleading information that compares the death rate for the entire population, not those who have/had Covid-19. [This explains it](https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-recovery-vaccine/). Further, according to [Johns Hopkins](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/johns-hopkins-medicine/), the current mortality rate in the [USA is 1.8%](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), or 15 times higher than what their article reports.
Furthermore, they have also promoted election fraud conspiracies during the 2020 election, such as this
[Biden Received Votes from Non-Citizens; Those Votes Number in the Thousands](https://genzconservative.com/biden-received-votes-from-non-citizens/). This story links to information gathered from right-leaning fact-checker [Just Facts Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-facts-daily/), which provides [misleading information](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/19/fact-check-claim-voting-noncitizens-2020-election-unverified/6237115002/). Finally, they also publish debunked conspiracy theories such as this [Is It True that Chief Justice John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island?](https://genzconservative.com/john-roberts-visited-epsteins-island/) (See failed fact check below). In general, Gen Z Conservative provides far-right biased commentary that is not always factual.
