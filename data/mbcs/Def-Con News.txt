History
[Founded in 2018](https://whois.domaintools.com/defconnews.com), Def-Con News is a conservative news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://defconnews.com/about/), “Def-Con News is conservative news, definitely. It’s also conservative news defiantly because we’re out to counter the liberal media push to demonize conservatives and silence conservative points of view.” They also state, “The information and breaking news on Def-Con News are 100% true and properly sourced. There are no conspiracy theories and wild speculation here; the left is crazy enough that we don’t need to make things up. Fake news is for the mainstream liberal media; DFC is real news for real conservatives.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose editors or ownership.

Analysis / Bias
Def-Con News does not report original news but rather opines from a far-right perspective on news stories. News is broken down into the following categories: CrazyJoe, KamalToe, NastyNancy, Leftist Violence, Democrats, Guns, America Haters, and The Purge. In reviewing articles in the America Haters category, it is evident that anyone who is LGBTQ, anti-racist, or a Democrat hates America

The about page claims that articles are 100% true and properly sourced; perhaps that is true if you consider the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) a proper source. We don’t.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and frequently promote false and misleading conspiracy theories. For example, they report the baseless claim that the Presidential Election was stolen from Donald Trump

Further, they promote covid-19 anti-vaccination propaganda such as this [THE REGIME UNLEASHES THE NEEDLE NAZIS](https://defconnews.com/2021/07/31/the-regime-unleashes-the-needle-nazis/). In general, Def-Con News lacks credibility as it frequently promotes far-right propaganda and conspiracy theories that are not true.
