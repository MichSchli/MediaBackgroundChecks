Analysis / Bias
According to an
[interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/28/morning-brew-tops-4-million-subscribers-as-it-looks-to-expand-with-ma.html) with the founders, their goal is “to make business news more enjoyable to read.” In review, when reporting on politicians, Morning Brew utilizes moderate emotionally loaded headlines such as [“A Look Back at Trump’s Relationship With Business, From Trade to the Stock Market.”](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2021/01/19/look-back-trumps-relationship-business-trade-stock-market) The subtitle reads, “Trump will become the first president since Hoover to leave the White House with fewer jobs than when he moved in.” This statement portrays Trump negatively by not explaining until the last paragraph that the Corona Virus wiped out the jobs and hence is not comparable to Hoover.
When reporting on the Biden administration
[“Biden goes after Big Meat to combat inflation.”](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/01/03/biden-goes-after-big-meat-to-combat-inflation) The subtitle reads “It’s part of the administration’s broader antitrust crackdown, but industry groups have pushed back.” For issues such as climate change [“Scientists say it’s ‘now or never to curb climate change: Plus, Trump’s Truth Social app is flailing.”](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/04/04/scientists-say-it-s-now-or-never-to-curb-climate-change) When it comes to sourcing the Morning Brew utilizes credible sources such as [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico-info/), [Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Bloomberg,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) and [AP News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) In general, story selection and opinions slightly favor the left.
