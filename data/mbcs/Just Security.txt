[The Trump-Giuliani Election Plan: Manipulating Voters](https://www.justsecurity.org/67799/the-trump-giuliani-election-plan-manipulating-american-voters/). This story is very well sourced from credible media outlets such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/), and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).

Both of these stories are appropriately sourced. In general, Just Security reports factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
