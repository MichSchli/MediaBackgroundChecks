Analysis / Bias
In review, the American Immigration Council is an advocacy group that favors immigration, believing that “immigrants strengthen America by bringing skills, talents, and new energy to our economy.” They utilize a combination of education and the court system to defend immigration. The American Immigration Council’s website also features a blog that uses moderately loaded words, especially when directed toward former President Trump and his immigration policies:
[Trump Dumps His Immigration Plan on America](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/content/trump-dumps-his-immigration-plan-america). This blog post is very well-sourced from credible .gov information. In addition to the blog, they also provide comprehensive fact sheets regarding immigration issues.
Executive Director Beth Werlin
[released the following statement](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/american-immigration-councils-statement-president-trumps-immigration-principles) regarding the former Trump Administration’s immigration policy: “The White House Immigration Principles and Policies are no more than the immigration restrictionists’ wish list. They are a nonstarter. There is broad bipartisan support for a permanent solution for Dreamers without poison pills attached to it. We must not squander the potential of this generation of young people who will help write the next great chapter of American history. They need a clear and permanent path forward. The White House principles ignore our American identity of being a nation of immigrants and fail to embrace the energy, innovation, and opportunities that immigrants bring to our county.”
