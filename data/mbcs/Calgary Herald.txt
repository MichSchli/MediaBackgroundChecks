Analysis / Bias
In review, The Calgary Herald covers local news through journalists with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[Sharif found guilty of attempted murder in Edmonton truck attack](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/sharif-found-guilty-of-attempted-murder-in-police-pedestrian-attack/wcm/71daae44-15ab-46f1-b1d8-084fdea9ace8). National news is derived primarily from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), whereas world news comes from multiple sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). In general straight news reporting is factual and presents with minimal biased wording. However, story selection tends to lean right.
Editorially, there is a clear right leaning bias with commentaries such as this:
[Editorial: Alberta must not be thrown under the bus to save Trudeau](https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-trudeaus-choices-are-clear-save-his-skin-or-save-a-country) and this [Andrew Coyne: Justin Trudeau has become the problem with the Liberal brand.](https://calgaryherald.com/news/canada/andrew-coyne-justin-trudeau-has-become-the-problem-with-the-liberal-brand/wcm/1b7bed91-80f7-4817-b337-091f3576feb5) While the Edmonton Journal does offer opposing viewpoints, on a whole more editorials favor the conservative right.
