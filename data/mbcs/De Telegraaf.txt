History
Founded by Lord Henry Tindal and beer magnate Gerard Adriaan Heineken in 1893,
[De Telegraaph](https://www.mediahuis.be/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Y18-2731_Mediahuis_Corporate-Brochure_FINAAL-voor-upload.pdf) is a Dutch tabloid daily newspaper. After Tindal died in 1902, Dutch newspaper publisher and wartime Nazi sympathizer [Hendrikus Marinus Cornelis (Hak) Holdert](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hak_Holdert) purchased De Telegraaf.

Analysis / Bias
The center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) leader
[Mark Rutte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_for_Freedom_and_Democracy) is the current Prime Minister of the Netherlands. During recent elections, Dutch alt-right, anti-immigration, and eurosceptic [Thierry Baudet](https://www.dw.com/en/thierry-baudet-the-new-face-of-the-euroskeptic-dutch-right/a-48012429) of the Forum for Democracy (FvD) party made gains in local elections, indicating the Netherlands is moving further to the right politically.
In review, De Telegraph
[covers](https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1536266819/forum-voor-democratie-leider-thierry-baudet-grijpt-terug-op-zakenkabinet) the Forum for Democracy (FvD) (Dutch far-right party) leader [Thierry Baudet](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/thierry-baudet-dutch-rightwing-populism) and other figureheads [favorably](https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1985305764/dienstmaagd-van-radicaal-rechts-toont-ware-gezicht). They also cover sensationalized celebrity gossip such as this: [“Fajah shows her boyfriend for the first time.”](https://www.telegraaf.nl/entertainment/1720920957/fajah-toont-voor-het-eerst-haar-vriend)
When reporting world news, De Telegraaf utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines, such as
[“Corbyn makes an excuse to Labor voters.”](https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1485560775/corbyn-maakt-excuus-aan-labour-kiezers) This story does not provide hyperlinks to outside sources. They also use loaded emotional headlines when covering immigration: [“8.5 percent of those suspected of an offense were immigrants”](https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1973956/8-5-procent-duitse-verdachten-immigrant); however, there isn’t a hyperlinked source to support this claim.
Articles about USA politics sometimes use a favorable tone for former President Trump, such as: “
[Donald Trump: “Well come on, impeach me!”](https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/376316457/donald-trump-nou-kom-op-impeach-me-dan). In 2018, according to [Reuters,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) a van drove into the office of [De Telegraaf](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-telegraaf-car/van-driven-into-front-of-dutch-daily-de-telegraafs-head-office-idUSKBN1JM0DU), which caused damage to the entrance and resulted in extra protection being given to media companies. In general, news reporting is poorly sourced with a strong right-leaning bias.
