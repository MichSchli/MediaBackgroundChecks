History
Founded in 2016, Sapiens is a digital magazine covering anthropology. According to their
[about page](https://www.sapiens.org/about-us/), the “mission is to bring anthropology—the study of being human—to the public, to make a difference in how people see themselves and the people around them. Our objective is to deepen your understanding of the human experience by exploring exciting, novel, thought-provoking, and unconventional ideas. Through news coverage, features, commentaries, reviews, photo essays, and much more, we work closely with anthropologists and journalists to craft intriguing and innovative ways of sharing the discipline with a worldwide audience.”
The website provides a

Funded by / Ownership
Sapiens is fully funded by the
[Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Inc](http://wennergren.org/), which is a “private operating foundation dedicated to the advancement of anthropology throughout the world.” The website is also supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation, which is known for funding interdisciplinary research and educational programs.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Sapiens publishes news about anthropology. Most information is science-based and free from bias, such as this:
[Should the Story of Homo’s Dispersal Out of Africa Be Rewritten?](https://www.sapiens.org/evolution/dispersal-hominin/) This story, like all others, is properly sourced to either credible media outlets or scientific publications.
Sapiens also publishes editorials that are negative toward the Trump administration, such as this:
[A Field Guide to Trump’s Swamp](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/trump-conflicts-interest/). Further, the website features a section called Culture Lab that looks at social issues from a left-leaning perspective, [Are Mixed-Income Neighborhoods the Best Answer for Public Housing?](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/mixed-income-housing-chicago/)
When first reviewing this site, I felt it would belong in our pro-science category as almost everything is science-based. However, Sapiens also publishes a lot of political content that falls to the left of the center.
