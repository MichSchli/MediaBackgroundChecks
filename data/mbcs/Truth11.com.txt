When it comes to sourcing, they use poor sources such as [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) and [Global Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-research/), which are known for failed fact checks and promoting conspiracy theories. Finally, they sometimes republish satire from [Real Raw News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-raw-news/) as “real” news. See failed fact checks.
