History
[Founded in 2014](http://whois.domaintools.com/newsner.com), Newsner is a sensational clickbait website that attempts to spread viral information across social media. Like most Questionable sources the website lacks an about page and disclosure of authors. Further, they do not list ownership on the website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsner publishes sensationalized news stories with loaded clickbait headlines such as this:
[Everyone looked forward to the balloons’ release, but seconds later disaster strikes](https://en.newsner.com/wow/everyone-looked-forward-to-the-balloons-release-but-seconds-later-disaster-strikes/) and [Parents kill 7-year-old son – then doctor finds a note in boy’s hand that crushes my heart](https://en.newsner.com/family/parents-kill-7-year-old-son-then-doctor-finds-a-note-in-boy-s-hand-that-crushes-my-heart/). This latter story gives the impression from the headline that it is a real story, however in the article they claim it is fictional. This is very misleading with the intent of garnering a click. Newsner also publishes Health and Science news with minimal sourcing of information. Health news tends to focus on natural cures, while science information falls in the [pseudoscience category](https://en.newsner.com/tricks/the-secret-no-doctor-tells-you-this-is-how-you-get-rid-of-lice-quickly-and-cheap/). In general, Newsner does not publish political news, but rather focuses on sensationalized life stories.
