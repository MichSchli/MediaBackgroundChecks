Analysis / Bias
In review, Harper’s Magazine publishes long-form narrative journalism and essays in print and with limited access on the website. Topics consist of culture, politics and social issues from a moderately liberal perspective. Headlines contain moderately loaded language such as this:
[Left of Europe](https://harpers.org/archive/2019/10/left-of-europe-brexit-european-union/) and this [Never Would I Ever](https://harpers.org/archive/2017/04/never-would-i-ever/), which showcases President Trump’s inconsistencies with his statements. The magazine and website also feature [Harper’s Index](https://harpers.org/archive/2019/10/harpers-index-october-2019/), which presents interesting factual statistics. Editorially, most stories moderately favor the left and are very well written for an educated reader.
