This story is properly sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [Task and Purpose](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/task-and-purpose/); however, in between, there are many emotional opinions interjected, such as this quote: “This is the profile of a man the president wants to pardon, and the precedence he is setting is deeply concerning.” Regarding sourcing information, Comic Sands uses credible sources, Tweets, and other social media posts.
Comics Sands is generally strongly left-biased based on story selection and wording that almost always favors the left.
