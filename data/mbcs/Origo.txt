Analysis / Bias
Origo is
[controlled](https://www.france24.com/en/20181130-hungary-media-shake-fuels-new-press-control-fears) by the Pro-Government Central European Press and Media Foundation (KESMA) and has been criticized for supporting the right-wing [Orban Government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/europe/hungary-viktor-orban-media.html).
Origo publishes articles with strong emotional headlines such as
[“Soros organizations control attacks on the Hungarian anti-pedophile law”](https://www.origo.hu/itthon/20210625-pedofiltorveny-soros-gyorgy-alex-soros-amnesty-tasz-helsinki-lmbtqpropaganda.html) and [“Viktor Orbán: Those coming from Ukraine are coming to a friendly place.”](https://www.origo.hu/itthon/20220226-orban-viktor-az-ukrajnabol-erkezok-barati-helyre-jonnek.html)
The website covers national politics, particularly in regards to Prime Minister Viktor Orban (leader of the Populist right-wing Fidesz party) favorably such as
[“The vast majority is satisfied with Viktor Orbán’s war crisis management.”](https://www.origo.hu/itthon/20220309-szazadveg-felmeres-orban-viktor-marki-zay-haboru.html)
On issues such as immigration, their coverage is negative focusing on migrant crime
[“Immigrants have invaded Brussels, and EU politicians are also in terror.](https://www.origo.hu/nagyvilag/20220128-leleplezodott-liberalisok-europa-felelem-a-muszlimoktol.html)” Their coverage of opposition party leader Péter Márki-Zay (Big Tent-United for Hungary) is negative in tone [“The Russians said they were bombing arms shipments, so the plan of the Hungarian opposition and Márki-Zay would plunge us into war.”](https://www.origo.hu/nagyvilag/20220313-az-oroszok-kozoltek-lebombazzak-a-fegyverszallitmanyokat-igy-haboruba-sodorna-minket-a-magyar.html) When covering USA politics, they have a negative opinion of Democratic President Joe Biden and support former President Donald Trump: [Joe Biden’s presidency brought total chaos after the scandalous election in November](https://www.origo.hu/nagyvilag/20210107-mar-hetek-ota-tudni-lehetet-mi-keszul-washingtonban.html). In this article, they promote Donald Trump’s election fraud conspiracy theories.
Origo generally promotes
[anti-Muslim populism](https://www.brookings.edu/research/anti-muslim-populism-in-hungary-from-the-margins-to-the-mainstream/) and holds far-right viewpoints that rely on misinformation to advance their agenda.
