Analysis / Bias
In review, Washington News Press appears to copy and paste news articles from other sources and publish them. For example,
[this story](https://fibrohealthnews.com/?p=537) was republished on May 4, 2020 even though it was [originally posted in 2014](https://www.eater.com/2014/7/25/6180901/mcdonalds-wont-cut-ties-with-chinese-meat-supplier). Story selection always favors the right and frequently uses loaded emotional wording such as this: [Brett Kavanaugh Casts Deciding Vote, Ends 9th Circuit Court Reign of Terror On Key Issue](https://fibrohealthnews.com/?p=530). This story is unsourced. In general, Washington News Press publishes news that is far right biased and often not factual.
