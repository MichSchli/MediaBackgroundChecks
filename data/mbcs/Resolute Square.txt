[ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) veterans and [Lincoln Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-lincoln-project/) members, Resolute Square is a website publishing news, podcasts, and newsletters to “preserve democracy.”
According to their

Our mission is to expose, inspire, inform and lead — and give you the tools to fight the poison peddlers who are trying to destroy our democracy.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Resolute Square publishes news stories, newsletters for subscribers, and a weekly program named
[Strategy Call](https://resolutesquare.com/events/72RwL7iwH8EPVIVW8Gozp4/strategy-call-he-s-back), in which members engage in a “weekly video call where Rick Wilson, Stu Stevens, Joe Trippi, and Reed Galen talk with Tara Setmayer about the latest in the battle to defend our democracy.”
The website also hosts shows by
[Joe Trippi (That Trippi Show)](https://resolutesquare.com/shows/that-trippi-show) and [Rick Wilson (Rick Wilson’s Enemy List)](https://resolutesquare.com/shows/the-enemies-list). Further, the website features text-based articles such as this [Why We Need Resolute Square Now](https://resolutesquare.com/articles/5pxFofz4vtnC9Ya8cVYQdR/why-we-need-resolute-square-right-now). Currently, there is little content on this new website; however, a review of the wording from this article indicates a significant left-leaning bias with a quote that reads:
“But defeating Donald Trump is not enough. Today the MAGA Republican Party has morphed into a sweeping authoritarian crusade. Don’t let the buffoonish characters fool you – it is a dedicated, serious movement housed in the Republican party, funded by billionaire plutocrats, staffed by dangerous men and women, and amplified by the radical right-wing media ecosystem led by Fox News. They are confident, patient, and committed to breaking American democracy.”
As of this review, the website has only been active for 3 days; therefore, content is limited, and so is the confidence of this review. We have subscribed to their newsletter and will make updates/adjustments to this review as more information is gathered.
[According](https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/lincoln-project-democracy-media-company) to an [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/) interview with Stuart Stevens, he clearly stated they are biased: “We’re going to proudly declare we’re all bias, all the time. All bias of democracy,” he added. “One of the slogans we’re using is, ‘We’re right, they’re wrong.'”
Currently, Resolute Square appears to hold a strong left-leaning bias by denigrating conservatives and republicans. Finally, we rate them High for factual reporting as there is no evidence of false information at this early stage. This may change, and we will update accordingly.
