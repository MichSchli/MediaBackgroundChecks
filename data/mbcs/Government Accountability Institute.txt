[1.7 million in funding](https://www.investopedia.com/news/trump-donor-robert-mercer-funded-book-clinton-cash-dealings/) from conservative donor Robert Mercer.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Government Accountability Institute primarily focuses on crony capitalism and anti-left investigations. For example, this investigation looks at Clinton and her connections to Russia:
[FROM RUSSIA WITH MONEY Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism](http://www.g-a-i.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Report-Skolkvovo-08012016-2.pdf). The investigation is very well-sourced; however, some of the information comes from the Clinton Cash book that is known to be factually mixed.
GAI also has a feature they call the
[Newsroom,](http://www.g-a-i.org/newsroom/) which curates news from a wide variety of sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) and the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), both of which we rate as mixed for factual reporting due to failed fact checks. In general, story selection favors the right and sometimes is derived from poor sources that have failed fact checks.
