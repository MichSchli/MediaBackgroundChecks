History
[Founded in 2009](http://whois.domaintools.com/conservativepapers.com), according to a domain search, the Conservative Papers is a hyper-Partisan blog that publishes news favorable to conservatives and former President Donald Trump. According to their [about page](https://conservativepapers.com/about/#.Xn_yq4hKiUk), they “spread the ideas of capitalism by writing about the proven solutions of conservative ideals and by making the public aware of the dangers of complacency.” The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership or offer bios for authors.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Conservative Papers is a website that promotes the conservative platform and Donald Trump. Story selection always favors the right such as this:
[COVID-19 Illegal Aliens Demand $1.2K Each in Taxpayer-Funded Checks](https://conservativepapers.com/news/2020/03/28/covid-19-illegal-aliens-demand-1-2k-each-in-taxpayer-funded-checks/#.Xn_v8YhKiUk). This story is sourced back to the Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and therefore is Questionable. Some other sources used by this site are the right-leaning [Daily Signa](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/)l, the Questionable [CNS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/), and FreePatriot.org. Generally, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left such as this [Does Joe Biden Have Dementia? Does It Matter?](https://conservativepapers.com/news/2020/03/20/does-joe-biden-have-dementia-does-it-matter/#.Xn_zK4hKiUk) In general, the Conservative Paper is misleading and uses poor sources.
