History
PoliticalDiscussion is an anti-Islam website that does not have an about page, author information, or ownership disclosure. In other words, the Owner(s) of the website wishes to remain anonymous as their content is Questionable. The website is part of a network of up to 14 websites that promotes anti-Muslim propaganda through an anonymous
[Anti-Muslim Network](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/freespeechfront.net?cid=04dab292-85f2-47b6-b18c-097b097f9da8). According to a [Guardian investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/06/inside-the-hate-factory-how-facebook-fuels-far-right-profit) in 2019, the network also features up to 21 Facebook pages that amplify the content reaching millions.
Due to the anonymous nature of these websites, they lack transparency. Further, the domains of sources within the network change frequently and therefore some of these sites may not be online all the time.
Funded by / Ownership
The websites in the network do not disclose ownership, and advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the websites affiliated with the network all publish negative stories toward Islam and attempt to paint a picture of Muslims as murderous and violent. For example: “
[TURKEY – woman, was executed by acid after over rumors that she mocked Islam](https://www.freespeechtime.net/2018/05/turkey-woman-was-executed-by-acid-after.html)” A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=mostly-center&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=TURKEY%20-%20woman%2C%20was%20executed%20by%20acid%20after%20over%20rumors%20that%20she%20mocked%20Islam&gsc.sort=) of this headline shows that this never happened or was never reported by a credible media source. This is a classic example of a misleading headline and the promotion of propaganda.
PoliticalDiscussion and other sources in the network frequently promote Israel and consistently denigrate Muslims such as this
[Child bride warns the West “When Islam comes, it conquers and it has no mercy.”](http://www.political-discussion.com/2019/01/child-bride-warns-west-when-islam-comes.html) They also do not source their information through hyperlinks. Further, many stories are poorly written or directly plagiarized from other sources. Finally, these sources hold a far-right bias and can be considered hate groups.
