History
Next News Network (NNN) was a website until 2017. At that time, the domain nextnewsnetwork.com began directing to a Youtube channel. Gary Franchi founded the Next News Network as an alternative news source. NNN is based in Illinois and has been
[classified](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/antigovernment) as being part of the anti-government movement. In 2010, founder Gary Franchi was listed on the [SPLC’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) hate list for [promoting the false claim that the U.S. was building concentration camps for Americans](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/meet-patriots) who disagreed with the government.
According to their
[about page](https://www.youtube.com/c/NextNewsNetwork/about), they are “Your most trusted liberty media channel for original commentary on news about President Trump, Election 2020, Liberal meltdowns, government corruption, and national headlines. If it affects your freedoms, you can bet it will be on The Next News Network hosted by Gary S Franchi Jr. Presenting conservative news from all over the web.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Next News Network publishes newsdesk-style videos throughout the day, with Gary Franchi serving as the primary host. Other hosts also broadcast news as well. Headlines and video content is often strongly worded to favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this:
[OH BOY! Joe Biden Looks Like Death at Campaign Stop — Something Is Wrong with Old Joe!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQSx4n8bBGM&ab_channel=TheNextNewsNetwork). This conspiratorial propaganda piece resembles similar claims made about Hilary Clinton in 2016 when NNN speculated that she had [Parkinson’s disease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAm7_4bZDdI&ab_channel=TheNextNewsNetwork).
Finally, NNN has also promoted that Michelle Obama is transgender, another conspiracy of the far-right
[LOOK!!! WHEN YOU LEARN WHAT OBAMA WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR TRANSGENDER SURGERIES, YOU WILL FREAK OUT!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYoOQigSF34&ab_channel=TheNextNewsNetwork). In general, this Youtube channel is designed to look and feel like a credible news broadcast; however, it is not. The reporting consists almost exclusively of far-right conspiracies and propaganda that most times is not true. Next News Network is not a credible source for news.
