Analysis / Bias
In review, Fact / Myth sources everything and is very accurate in their claims. However, they do occasionally use loaded words to describe conservatives such as Donald Trump. For example, in this article,
[Donald Trump has a lot in Common With Tyrants, Classically Speaking,](http://factmyth.com/factoids/donald-trump-has-a-lot-in-common-with-the-tyrants-classically-speaking/) they build the case to compare him to ruthless dictators. While they do a great job of sourcing, it still is a stretch to compare Trump to Hitler, which to their credit, they do disclaim. For the most part, Fact / Myth rarely fact-checks political issues, but rather historical claims such as this: [Thomas Jefferson and John Adams Died on July 4th 1826.](http://factmyth.com/factoids/thomas-jefferson-and-john-adams-died-on-july-4th-1826/) Again, this was well-researched and sourced.
