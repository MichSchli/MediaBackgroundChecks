Analysis / Bias
In review, AjuaNews is actually named “Today Breaking News” with a tagline that reads “Daily Chicago News.” Not surprisingly, there isn’t any news pertaining to Chicago. The news published on this website comes from an extreme right pro-Trump perspective and often is not factual. Headlines are emotionally loaded to favor the right such as this:
[Clarence Thomas Says SCOTUS Is Ready To ‘Crush The Coup Against President Trump’](https://ajuanews.com/clarence-thomas-says-scotus-is-ready-to-crush-the-coup-against-president-trump/). When it comes to sourcing information, AjuaNews simply does not source at all. Quite simply this is a fake news website with zero credibility.
Despite AjuaNews only being 1 month old at the time of this review they already have a Pants on Fire claim registered with
