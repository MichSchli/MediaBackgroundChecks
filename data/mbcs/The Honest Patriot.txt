History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/thehonestpatriot.net), The Honest Patriot is an anonymously published website that produces conservative news and commentary. The website completely lacks transparency as they do not have an about page, name editors, authors, or owners.

Analysis / Bias
The Honest Patriot publishes news stories geared toward a conservative audience. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[Texas Obliterates Biden’s Vaccine Mandate](https://thehonestpatriot.net/texas-obliterates-bidens-vaccine-mandate/) and this [Trump Slams Pro-Infrastructure Bill Republicans During Party Dinner](https://thehonestpatriot.net/trump-slams-pro-infrastructure-bill-republicans-during-party-dinner/). A common theme with all articles reviewed is the lack of hyperlinked sourcing to an external source. The only sourcing we could find comes from tweets.
Editorially, all stories reviewed favor a conservative perspective and denigrate the left. We could not find any blatant instances of false information, but it isn’t easy to gauge as they do not source their information. Based on a lack of sourcing and transparency, we have no choice but to rate them Mixed for factual reporting. They could improve their rating if they took “honesty” seriously and became more transparent.
