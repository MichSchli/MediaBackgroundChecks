This website completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page or disclose ownership. Most news posts link to either JD Heyes, Mike Adams, or Ethan Huff and none of them have biographical information listed on the website. A Google search shows that

Analysis / Bias
In review, Pandemic News publishes news that is primarily related to diseases such as Covid-19. However, a majority of news focuses on conspiracy theories such as this:
[Imagine the opposite: The “NHWO” Natural Health World Organization to resolve issues like COVID-19](https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-04-25-imagine-the-opposite-natural-health-world-organization-covid-19.html). This story links to the unreliable Far-Right Natural News. In another story that lacks evidence, they report [Did China cover up the deaths of MILLIONS from coronavirus?](https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-04-26-did-china-cover-up-the-deaths-of-millions-from-coronavirus.html)
In general, most stories on this website link directly to the discredited Natural News. Finally, this source uses the terms Wuhan Virus or China Virus to describe the pandemic, rather than the appropriate term Covid-19.
The bottom line, this is an unreliable source for information on Covid-19.
