Analysis / Bias
UAWire publishes articles sourcing mainly through quotes such as
[“US has put two Ukrainian air carriers on sanctions list over ties with Iran?”](https://uawire.org/news/tender-worth-40-million-usd-or-why-halting-the-power-supply-to-lpr-was-stalled-for-three-years) and “ [Ukrainian army will receive a new batch of Hummers from the USA.”](https://uawire.org/ukrainian-army-will-receive-a-new-batch-of-hummers-from-the-usa) Editorially, they have a left-leaning bias.
