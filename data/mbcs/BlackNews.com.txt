Analysis / Bias
In review, BlackNews.com publishes social justice, culture, entertainment, and politics news. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded language such as this:
[Still No Jail Time For White Couple Who Starved and Abused Their Black Adopted Children](https://www.blacknews.com/news/no-jail-time-fry-couple-starved-abused-black-adopted-children/). This story does not have an author name or any sourcing or citations as to where it came from. Many stories on the website highlight social injustice, such as the one above and this [Black Mom Who Adopted White Baby Says the Police Have Been Called on Her Twice](https://www.blacknews.com/news/keia-jones-baldwin-black-mom-adopted-white-baby-police-called-accused-kidnapping/).
Editorially, they frequently report negatively on President Donald Trump, such as this,
[6 Lies and Truths About Black Unemployment Under Trumpâ€™s Administration](https://www.blacknews.com/news/lies-truths-black-unemployment-under-trump-administration/). Generally, the news is reported with a left-leaning bias and is usually factual. However, this is a questionable source with a complete lack of transparency and little to no sourcing of information.
