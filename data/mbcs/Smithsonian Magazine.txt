Analysis / Bias
In review, the website contains select stories from the print magazine and original web-only content. Smithsonian.com covers history, hard science, popular science, nature, and technology. Articles are typically sourced to research and generally are low in bias such as this:
[This Solar-Powered Dehydrator Could Help Small Farmers Reduce Food Waste](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/solar-powered-dehydrator-could-help-small-farmers-reduce-food-waste-180973221/). The Smithsonian typically steers away from politics and only reports about science such as this: [Trump Administration Overhauls How the Endangered Species Act Is Enforced](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/trump-administration-has-overhauled-endangered-species-act-180972890/). Further, they also promote the consensus of science on [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/).
