Analysis / Bias
InSight Crime’s “
[2023 By The Numbers”](https://insightcrime.org/the-organization/insight-crimes-2023-by-the-numbers/) outlines their in-depth analysis of organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean. They reportedly published 15 in-depth investigations and conducted 38 field trips across the region, interviewing over 1,000 individuals in 2023.
Their featured report,
[“Stolen Amazon: The Roots of Environmental Crime in the Tri-Border Regions,”](https://insightcrime.org/investigations/stolen-amazon-roots-environmental-crime-tri-border-regions/) investigates illegal activities in the Amazon, focusing on environmental crimes and their impact on local communities. The report employs emotionally loaded language, such as “Mad scramble to unearth gold,” “Tens of thousands of them have invaded the territory,” “Scarred the earth and left mud pits,” “Illegal prospectors have even razed forest,” “Criminal actors and illicit economies flow and merge like the region’s many rivers,” and “Amazon forest is being felled to grow coca.”
These examples demonstrate how the choice of words and phrases can introduce a subjective tone into a report. While such language can be effective in drawing attention to the seriousness of the issues, it also has the potential to shape the reader’s perception, steering them towards a particular emotional or judgmental response rather than a purely factual understanding.
Methodologically, the report is based on desktop research, phone interviews, and fieldwork in
[Colombia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/colombia-government-and-media-profile/), [Venezuela](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/venezuela-media-profile/), [Peru](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/peru-government-and-media-profile/), and [Brazil](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brazil-media-profile/). It uses firsthand accounts and broader research to build its narrative. However, while practical, reliance on phone interviews may limit the depth of understanding, especially in marginalized communities. Furthermore, verifying the credibility of sources over the phone is challenging, and the need for anonymity due to security concerns in high-crime areas raises ethical questions.
We also analyzed news articles, such as the article on
[Former President Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) approach to organized crime in Latin America titled [“How President Donald Trump Has Impacted Organized Crime in Latin America,” ](https://insightcrime.org/news/brief/president-trump-organized-crime-latin-america/)which uses emotionally loaded language, such as Phrases like “unilateral policies that largely backfired” and “mercurial approach” imply an aggressive, ineffective, and unpredictable policy strategy. Terms such as “squandered efforts” and “ineffective border wall” further emphasize a negative judgment on the administration’s actions, indicating a subjective viewpoint that could influence readers’ perceptions. The article relies on circular referencing and cites its previous reports and investigations. It also references [Whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/). However, some external links, such as the one referring to the “White House memorandum,” paved the way,” leading to a [404/Page Not Found error,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/13/presidential-memorandum-secretary-state) indicating broken links.
In general, InSight Crime’s efforts to analyze organized crime in Latin America are commendable, but the choice of language and certain methodological aspects may introduce subjectivity into their work.
