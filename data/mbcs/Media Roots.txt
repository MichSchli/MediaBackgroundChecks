Analysis / Bias
Media Roots utilizes strong loaded words and some of their articles are poorly sourced such as “
[Hillary Clinton’s Business of Corporate Shilling & War Making.](http://mediaroots.org/hillary-clintons-business-of-corporate-shilling-war-making/)” However, some of their articles are sourced to credible news media such as [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Media Roots has a far-left political bias with support for [socialism](http://mediaroots.org/marxism-101-how-capitalism-is-killing-itself-with-dr-richard-wolff/) and most articles on their website favor the left. While many articles are factual, Media Roots also promotes [Vaccine](http://mediaroots.org/to-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate-can-parents-to-even-question/) and [GMO](http://mediaroots.org/gmo-foods-pose-higher-risks-for-children/) [propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) as well as [9/11 conspiracy theories](http://mediaroots.org/911-and-the-redefinition-of-conspiracy-theory/).
