In review, Metro Philadephia offers original news reporting on local news as well as republished stories from credible outlets such as the
[Philadelphia Inquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/philadelphia-inquirer/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Local news reporting generally features low biased wording such as this [Kensington residents call for change following Somerset closure](https://philly.metro.us/kensington-residents-call-for-change-following-somerset-closure/).
Editorially, they do not directly publish opinion content and when reporting on political news they almost exclusively rely on Reuters. On certain issues, they tend to lean left such as frequent news stories that are favorable toward
