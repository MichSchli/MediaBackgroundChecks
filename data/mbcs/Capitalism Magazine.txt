Analysis / Bias
In review, Capitalism Magazine publishes news and information from an Objectivist Libertarian perspective. Original reporting often contains loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Elizabeth Warren’s “Accountable Capitalism” Is More Dangerous Than Bernie Sander’s “Democratic Socialism](https://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2019/09/elizabeth-warrens-accountable-capitalism-is-more-dangerous-than-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism/).” This article is properly sourced from credible sources of information.
While the majority of stories are critical of the left, they also occasionally report negatively on conservatism and former President Trump, such as this:
[Immigration Is Great: A Big Win for America](https://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2015/08/immigration-is-great-a-big-win-for-america/). The website features many prominent Libertarian writers such as John Stossel and Thomas Sowell. In general, Capitalism Magazine holds right-leaning views when it comes to free-market economics, the Second Amendment, and disdain for liberal economic policies. They also hold left-leaning views when it comes to personal liberty, such as support for gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and immigration.
