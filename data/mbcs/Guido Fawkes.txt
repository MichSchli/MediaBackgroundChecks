Analysis / Bias
According to a Guardian
[interview](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/31/interview-paul-staines-guido-fawkes), Political blogger aka Guido Fawkes describes himself as an ‘anarcho-libertarian, or Thatcherite on drugs.’ The blog [publishes scandals](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/04/guido-fawkes-blogger-gossip) related to politicians, with Guido stating its aim is to expose rumors and conspiracies of Westminster.
In review, Guido Fawkes (order-order.com) utilizes emotionally loaded language in its headlines, such as
[“ANDREA JENKYNS: BREXIT LEGEND”](https://order-order.com/2018/06/12/andrea-jenkyns-brexit-legend/) and [“DOG WHISTLE LABOUR MESSAGES SENT TO MUSLIM VOTERS.](https://order-order.com/2017/06/08/dog-whistle-labour-messages-sent-muslim-voters/)” These blog posts often display social media posts from Twitter or Facebook, with Paul Staines writing short comments such as Theresa May’s policies “will mercilessly target our communities, our places of worship and all areas of our lives.” Worrying stuff…”
Essentially, Guido Fawkes is adding a few opinionated soundbites to their blog posts with the hope of increasing discussion to
[encourage clicking](https://order-order.com/tag/blogging-on-blogging/) (Clickbait) or sharing on social media.

Further, this source downplays [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) by publishing articles that show [Polar Bears are thriving](https://order-order.com/2018/04/03/polar-bears-thriving-contrary-predictions/) and demonstrating that [green energy is too costly](https://order-order.com/2018/05/31/offshore-wind-farm-will-cost-2-5-billion-subsidies/).
