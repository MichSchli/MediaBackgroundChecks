Analysis / Bias
NBC News is what some call a
[mainstream media source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media). They typically publish/report factual news that uses moderately loaded words in headlines such as this: [Trump threatens border security shutdown, GOP cool to idea.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-threatens-government-shutdown-over-border-wall-immigration-issues-n895716) Story selection tends to favor the left through both wording and bias by omission, where they underreport some news stories that are favorable to the right. NBC always sources its information to credible sources that are either low biased or high for factual reporting.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/nbc-news/) found that 42% of NBC News’ audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 39% Mixed, and 19% consistently or mostly conservative. A more liberal audience prefers NBC. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 46% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 35% do not, ranking them #5 in trust of the major USA news providers.
