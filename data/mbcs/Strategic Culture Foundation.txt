History
[Founded in 2010](http://whois.domaintools.com/strategic-culture.org), the Strategic Culture Foundation (SCF) provides a platform for exclusive analysis, research, and policy comment on Eurasian and global affairs.
SCF completely lacks transparency by not listing owners or editors. Further, the domain is registered in Russia, which the owners do not openly disclose, and there is no contact page.

Funded by / Ownership
Ownership of the Strategic Culture Foundation is not disclosed. We cannot determine how revenue is derived as there is no monetization source (ads, donations, etc.). However, the site features authors and has maintenance costs, so funding comes from somewhere.
