Analysis / Bias
The Climate Reality Project advocates for action against climate change. Besides Climate Change advocacy, they also publish a blog that leans strongly left in wording and story selection, such as this
[ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM: WHAT IT IS AND HOW YOU CAN FIGHT IT](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/environmental-racism-what-it-and-how-you-can-fight-it). While TCRP is well-sourced and factual in scientific information, it also has a left bias in its criticism of Conservatives. We give this organization a moderate left bias rating based on story selection that opposes the conservative perspective that [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is not human-caused or simply not important.
