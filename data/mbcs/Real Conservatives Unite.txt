History
Real Conservatives Unite is a news and opinion website that does not provide an about page to describe their purpose. A
[domain search](http://whois.domaintools.com/realconservativesunite.com) reveals the domain was purchased in 2012 with an IP address from NJ. This does not mean the source is from New Jersey. Basically, this site completely lacks transparency in every way. [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Again, Real Conservatives Unite does not disclose any information regarding ownership. Revenue is derived from advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website typically republishes snippets from other sources that lead to a link to the full story. We could not find any original content in a 20 article review. Most articles are derived from the right-wing conspiracy website
[Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) or the factually Mixed [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/). Regardless, most stories lean toward the right and are conspiratorial such as this: [Comey: Trump Stirring Up Racism for Political Benefits](https://realconservativesunite.com/2019/08/05/comey-trump-stirring-up-racism-for-political-benefits/). In general, all stories on the website favor the right and use poor sources.
