Analysis / Bias
In review, Healthline provides health and wellness information that is scientifically based. Most articles are written in an easy-to-understand format and sourced to medical journals. However, this website also covers alternative health that is unproven to be effective. For example, they promote the
[Health Benefits of Throat Chakra Stones](https://www.healthline.com/health/health-benefits-of-throat-chakra-stones), which does not have scientific data to prove that it works.
While Healthline lists the supposed benefits of Throat Chakra Stones, they also indicate several times in the articles that there isn’t scientific evidence to support their use. It might be best not to report on unproven alt health. Most content is factual and scientific; however, because they allow room for pseudoscience, we rate them Mostly Factual rather than High.
