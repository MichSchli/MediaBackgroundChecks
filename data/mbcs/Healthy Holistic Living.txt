Analysis / Bias
In review, Healthy Holistic Living is a typical pseudoscience website promoting
[anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). Healthy Holistic Living also promotes miracle cures: Study: [Manuka honey kills more bacteria than all available antibiotics](http://archive.is/VghtP#selection-1255.0-1255.70). There isn’t any [evidence](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-manuka-honey-better-than-all-known-antibiotics/) to support this claim. This site also promotes [Chemtrail conspiracy theories](https://www.healthy-holistic-living.com/heavy-metal-contamination-shasta-county/).
