Analysis / Bias
In review, The Columbian covers news, sports, business, and lifestyle for the greater Vancouver, Washington, and Clark Counties region. Articles and headlines present local news with minimally loaded language, such as this
[Battle Ground man accused in Oregon burglary](https://www.columbian.com/news/2020/nov/26/battle-ground-man-arrested-on-burglary-charges/). The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) provide national and international stories.
Editorially, The Columbian endorses candidates on the state and local level; however, in the 2020 Presidential Election, they did not endorse either candidate. Locally, they endorse both Democrats and Republicans. For example, they
[endorsed](https://www.columbian.com/news/2020/nov/01/the-columbian-editorial-boards-endorsements/) Democratic Governor Jay Inslee, and for Washington Secretary of State, they endorsed Republican Kim Wyman. Reviewing editorials and opinion pieces reveals a reasonable balance with slightly more favoring the left. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
