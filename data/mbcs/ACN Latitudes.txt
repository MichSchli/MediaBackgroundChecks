Analysis / Bias
In review, the Association for Comprehensive Neurotherapy is a
[natural health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) website that promotes pseudoscience. For example, they offer the [unsupported claim](https://latitudes.org/causes-of-autism-a-complete-review/) that [vaccinations are a cause for Autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). ACN also routinely publishes [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and many [miracle cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) that are not endorsed by the consensus of the medical community. Lastly, this source publishes [misleading information,](https://latitudes.org/18-ways-to-limit-radiation-exposure/) such as Wi-Fi causing too much radiation exposure, leading to health problems. [This simply is not true](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/nonsense-about-the-health-effects-of-electromagnetic-radiation/).
