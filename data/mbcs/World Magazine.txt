Analysis / Bias
World Magazine covers international news, cultural analysis, and book/movie reviews from a moderate Christian perspective. Articles and headlines sometimes contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[Texas governor declares disaster along southern border](https://wng.org/sift/texas-governor-declares-disaster-along-southern-border-1622670260) and this [Christians in a politically charged climate](https://wng.org/articles/christians-in-a-politically-charged-climate-1620533935). While many stories favor a Christian right-leaning perspective, they are known to call out fellow Christians, such as conservative Christian [Dinesh D’Souza](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/nyregion/dinesh-dsouza-is-out-as-kings-college-president-in-scandal.html), after he had shared a hotel room with his fiancee before filing for divorce from his previous wife. After WORLD broke the story, D’Souza resigned as president of New York’s The King’s College in response.
Editorially, they promote political bias based on their Christian perspective. Ie. Against
[abortion](https://world.wng.org/tags/abortion), [LGBTQ rights](https://world.wng.org/tags/transgenderism), and even [evolution](https://world.wng.org/2017/03/jumping_genes_further_debunk_evolution). If not for generally solid news reporting, we would have rated World in our [pseudoscience category](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary/), promoting the pseudoscience of [Intelligent Design.](https://world.wng.org/categories/intelligent_design)
