Analysis / Bias
In review, GeoEngineering Watch is primarily concerned with weather manipulation for sinister means and the use of
[HAARP](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/HAARP). For example, they claim that the devastating hurricane Florence was manipulated by [Microwaves Transmissions](https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/geoengineering-microwave-transmissions-and-their-connection-to-hurricane-florence/) and that the government is using [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) for control of the environment as well. Throw in some anti-vax hysteria, and you have yourself a truly tin foil-quackery website.
