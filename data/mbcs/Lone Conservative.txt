Analysis / Bias
In review, the Lone Conservative features young conservative writers who report with a moderately strong right-wing bias. Most headlines contain moderately loaded language, but some are very strong such as this one:
[Don’t Buy Beto’s Disgraceful False Equivalence on the NFL Protests.](https://loneconservative.com/2018/09/07/dont-buy-betos-disgraceful-false-equivalence-on-the-nfl-protests/) The content of articles is generally well written, researched, and sourced; however, sometimes [they source](https://loneconservative.com/2018/09/14/is-facism-right-wing/) questionable sources such as Dinish D’Souza, who has a [poor track record](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=dinesh%20d'souza&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) with fact-checkers. The use of sources like Dinesh D’Souza reduces the credibility of what could have been a strong, informative article.
