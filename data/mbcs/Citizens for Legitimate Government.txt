Analysis / Bias
In review, in the past, CLG News provided original writing by Michael Rectenwald; however, in 2020, they appear only to give summaries of news stories and provide links to the source. For news curation sites, we analyze the topic selection and sources used. A review of 50 news stories reveals more favoring the right using credible sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [MSN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msn-com/). However, there is an equal use of poor sources such as the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), [National File](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-file/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/). All of whom have failed numerous fact checks.
On the websiteâ€™s sidebar, they provide a link to
[Scholars for 9/11 Truth](https://911scholars.org/), which promotes 9/11 conspiracies such as controlled demolition and an inside job. Further, they also offer a link to wirelesswatchblog.org, which promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy theories regarding wireless technologies. In general, this source provides curated news stories that lean right and sometimes use poor sources. They also promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience by endorsing websites that promote such.
In this update of 2022, they are continuing their mission to misinform through Covid-19 misinformation such as this
[Poll by Vaccine Safety Research Foundation indicates more than a quarter of COVID vaccine recipients were injured after receiving shot](https://www.legitgov.org/poll-vaccine-safety-research-foundation-indicates-more-quarter-covid-vaccine-recipients-were-injured). In general, this is still a right-leaning conspiracy and pseudoscience source.
