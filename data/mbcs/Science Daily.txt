Analysis / Bias
In review, Science Daily is primarily a science news aggregation and curation site. The articles are selected from news releases submitted by universities and other research institutions. There is little bias exhibited as they tend only to publish pro-science information. This is a popular science site that summarizes reports in one paragraph and then links to the full article. They never skew data and summarize properly, based on our numerous reviews.
