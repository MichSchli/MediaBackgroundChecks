History
In 1889, Juhani Aho, Ero Erkko, and Arvid Järnefelt launched a newspaper called
[Päivälehti](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/lifestyle/6038-hesari-s-history-in-a-nutshell.html) as the organ of the nationalistic Young Finnish Party (for liberation from Russia). Its first editor-in-chief was Ero Erkko. In 1904, Päivälehti was shut down by The Russians (From 1809 until 1917, Finland was under Russian rule). Within a few days, Helsingin Sanomat (organ of the Liberal Progressive Party) was founded, replacing the abolished Päivälehti.
Helsingin Sanomat is printed in Tabloid format and headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. The paper covers news, entertainment, culture, science, finance, and sports, and they are known as Finland’s “newspaper of record.” The editor is

Analysis / Bias
[VoxEurop (English)](https://voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-information/564-helsingin-sanomat) describes [Helsingin Sanomat’s](https://voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-information/564-helsingin-sanomat) reporting as “apolitical, with essentially “straight” news reporting and close coverage of current events abroad.”
Editorially, Helsingin Sanomat strongly
[advocates](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/world-leaders-receive-pens-with-carbon-dioxide-ink-as-a-call-to-climate-action-300924251.html) for Climate action. They also ran a [campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JAwo-NlD0E) selling ugly sweaters that promotes environmentalism and brings attention to social justice issues such as sexual harassment.
In review, when covering national news, Helsingin Sanomat appears to have a neutral tone towards the Center-Left PM of Finland,
[Sanna Marin](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/world/europe/finland-sanna-marin.html): [“In her New Year greeting to Prime Minister Sanna Marin: Finland is coping with learning new things.”](https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000006358716.html) They also tend to cover Jussi Halla-Aho, the leader of the [Finns Party](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/politics/17150-finns-party-is-one-of-largest-populist-parties-in-western-europe-says-researcher.html) (nationalist populist right-wing party), with minimally loaded emotional language such as [here.](https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000005770506.html)
Recently, Helsingin Sanomat was strongly
[criticized](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/16791-china-runs-full-page-ad-on-hong-kong-in-helsingin-sanomat-sparking-criticism.html) by Eurosceptic right-leaning Center Party MP Mikko Kärnä for publishing a full-page pro-China advertisement on Hong Kong on its front page. Helsingin Sanomat responded by stating that they also published advertisements supporting the Hong Kong protesters. The paper has also been criticized for its lack of [diversity](https://www.migranttales.net/helsingin-sanomat-is-still-a-predominantly-white-newspaper-with-a-white-slant-on-things/). When covering the USA, they have an anti-Trump tone as they lined billboards on Trump’s motorcade route with ads stating, “ [Mr. President, Welcome to the Land of Free Press.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/finnish-newspapers-billboards-trump-press_n_5b4c4e08e4b0bc69a788aa83)”
