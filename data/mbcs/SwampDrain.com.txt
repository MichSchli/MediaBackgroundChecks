Analysis / Bias
In review, SwampDrain reports news with an extreme right-wing bias that always favors the right and denigrates the left. There is significant use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Fitton UNLEASHES After Attempted Presidential Coup: ‘Bill Barr Needs To Step Up & Defend Trump’](https://swampdrain.com/2019/02/21/fitton-unleashes-after-attempted-presidential-coup-bill-barr-needs-to-step-up-defend-trump/). The website also favors President Trump with entire categories dedicated to MAGA, Keep America Great, and Trump Administration. SwampDrain routinely utilizes questionable sources such as [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/) and USA for Trump. In general, this is a Pro-Trump propaganda site.
