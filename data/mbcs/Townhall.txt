Analysis / Bias
In review, Townhall almost exclusively publishes news articles that favor conservatives and utilizes strongly loaded language such as this:
[Shove It, House Democrats: Another Trump-Russia Story Blows Up](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2019/02/01/shove-it-house-democrats-another-trump-russia-story-blows-up-n2540636). This story is sourced from the left-leaning [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/) and right-leaning [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). In another article with loaded language, by Rush Limbaugh’s brother David: [Abortion Extremism Exposing Left’s Moral Contradictions,](https://townhall.com/columnists/davidlimbaugh/2019/02/01/abortion-extremism-exposing-lefts-moral-contradictions-n2540624) there is not a single source listed to support Mr. Limbaugh’s claims.
Townhall generally presents story selection that always favors the right and uses negative wording to describe the left. There is little balance in story presentation, with all information favoring the right without presenting a left perspective or counter-argument. The opinion columnists with Townhall have poor fact-check records, such as
[Michelle Malkin](https://factualsearch.news/#/&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=michelle%20malkin&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact-check), [Ann Coulter](https://factualsearch.news/#/&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=ann%20coulter&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact-check), and [Ben Shapiro](https://factualsearch.news/#/&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Ben%20shapiro&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact-check). Straight news reporting is generally sourced properly and factual, though worded in favor of the right, while guest blog posts have an abysmal track record with fact-checkers.
