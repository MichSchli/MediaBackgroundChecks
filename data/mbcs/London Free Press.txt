Funded by / Ownership
The London Free Press is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc. which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc. joined the Postmedia board, and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018, due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
