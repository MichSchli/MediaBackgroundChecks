Analysis / Bias
In review, What’s the Harm is a website that focuses on the harm pseudoscience has done. Their page states that “368,379 people killed, 306,096 injured, and over $2,815,931,000 in economic damages.” However, they do not state how these numbers are derived. Further, the website relies on anecdotal evidence rather than concrete peer-reviewed objective evidence. While many of the topics they list are indeed classified as pseudoscience, they simply do not provide proper evidence to support their claims. Based on this, we rate them a Questionable source.
