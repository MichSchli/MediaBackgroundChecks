History
Founded by Giora Shamis and Diane Shalem,
[DEBKAfile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debkafile) is an Israeli military intelligence website based in Jerusalem. They are primarily focused on the Middle East, and they provide commentary and analyses on terrorism, intelligence, military, and international relations. In their own words: “ [DEBKAFile](https://www.debka.com/about/) was founded by a team of journalists in June 2000 […], DEBKAfile is an independent Internet Web site, providing an intelligence and security news service.” [Read our profile on Israel’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Debkafile does not clearly explain ownership or funding, but advertising is present on the website.
Analysis / Bias
In review, DEBKAfile does not provide sources for their claims; instead, using “
[Our sources](https://www.debka.com/mivzak/reports-trump-peace-plan-soon-ready-presentation-unfounded/)” in its commentaries. There is very little use of loaded language; however, [other sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debkafile) have reported that DEBKAfile holds a neoconservative and pro-Israel position. While the claims made on DEBKAfile may very well be true, we cannot verify them without knowing the sources of their information. Due to a lack of transparency, we rate them Questionable.
