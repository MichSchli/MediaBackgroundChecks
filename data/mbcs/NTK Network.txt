Analysis / Bias
In review, NTK present news with a strong right-leaning bias. All stories tend to favor the right and denigrate the left through the use of loaded words and story selection. NTK does a good job of sourcing their information to a variety of
[Left-Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/leftcenter/), [Least Biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/), and [Right-Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right-center/) sources, however they also source to far-right sources that have a [mixed record](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2015/may/22/fact-checking-claims-about-gender-pay-gaps-hillary/) with fact-checkers, such as the [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/). In many ways, NTK Network is similar to the Washington Free Beacon, in that they take a credible source of information and use spin to create a different narrative. So, the information may be factual, but the message may lack context or mislead with a right-wing bias. An excellent example is how NTK Network routinely reported on the [Clinton Uranium story](https://ntknetwork.com/?s=uranium) when it has been [debunked](http://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/facts-uranium-one/) for several years.
