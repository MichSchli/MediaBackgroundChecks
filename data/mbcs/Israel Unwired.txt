Analysis / Bias
Israel Unwired is a conservative website that criticizes left-leaning politicians and media outlets. The website consistently presents news stories that favor Israel and often denigrate Muslims and the political left.
Israel Unwired frequently uses sensational headlines and cherry-picked facts to support its arguments. This article about the US President states,
[“PRESIDENT BIDEN GAVE PALESTINIAN ARABS HIS BLESSING TO KEEP KILLING JEWS.](https://www.israelunwired.com/president-biden-gave-palestinian-arabs-his-blessing-to-keep-killing-jews/)” The site accuses President Biden of giving his “blessing” to Palestinian Arabs to continue “killing Jews.” The article uses emotionally charged language and presents a biased interpretation of Biden’s statements about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The article provides no evidence to support its claims and misrepresents Biden’s comments. A quote from the article reads, “All the creation of this Arab State led to was bloodshed of Israelis. So why would the Biden puppet administration support this?” The statement uses loaded language by referring to the “Biden puppet administration,” This language and lack of evidence suggest a biased and emotional perspective rather than an objective and informative one.
In another article under the
[“Islamophobia”](https://www.israelunwired.com/category/islamophobia/) category, they publish articles with sensational headlines, such as [“SHOCKING VIDEO OF RADICAL ISLAM IN CANADIAN SCHOOL,](https://www.israelunwired.com/shocking-video-of-radical-islam-in-canadian-school/)” and repeatedly use the term “radical Islam” throughout the article. Additionally, Israel Unwired has a pro-Netanyahu bias regarding Israeli politics.
They also republish stories from the
[Jewish News Syndicate (JNS)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jewish-news-syndicate-jns/). For example, the article [“Israel’s Protests are Now Crossing Sacred Red Lines,”](https://www.israelunwired.com/israels-protests-are-now-crossing-sacred-red-lines/) published on Israel Unwired, has a pro-Benjamin Netanyahu tone while criticizing the protesters calling for his resignation. The article presents a one-sided perspective and uses misleading information. In general, Israel Unwired holds a far-right bias in story selection and editorial positions and is not always factual in reporting.
