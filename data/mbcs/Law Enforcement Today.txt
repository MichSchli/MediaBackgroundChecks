History
[Founded in 2008 (domain registration)](http://whois.domaintools.com/lawenforcementtoday.com), Law Enforcement Today is a news and opinion website that reports the news for those in the law enforcement profession. The website lack transparency as they do not provide an about page or disclose ownership. However, they do provide an about section on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/law.enforcement.today/about/?ref=page_internal) that reads: “We publish first-hand accounts of how officers have successfully faced adversity or practiced excellence in law enforcement. We share news about the topics that impact the law enforcement community – including not just the officers, but also their loved ones.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Law Enforcement Today publishes news through either a generic staff label or through outside writers. Story selection almost always favors the right and utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[Protester throws first punch at Trump supporter. Immediately regrets it.](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/protester-throws-first-punch-at-trump-supporter-immediately-regrets-it/) And this [Police-bashing, tax-dodging Al Sharpton got $1 million last year from own charity, records show](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/police-bashing-tax-dodging-al-sharpton-got-1-million-last-year-from-own-charity-records-show/). This last story is sourced to the Questionable [Federalist Papers Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist-papers-project/), which has failed numerous fact checks.
Law Enforcement Today also publishes editorials that strongly favor the right through
[negative reporting on immigrants](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/cop-murdered-by-undocumented-immigrants-media-we-cant-blame-sanctuary-laws/) as well as routine [denigration of Democrats](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/obama-afraid-white-folks-were-running-from-us-in-violent-cities-like-chicago-and-youre-still-running/). This source is also pro-Trump, frequently glorifying Trump supporters who fight back against protesters such as this: [Female MMA fighter drops anti-Trump ‘professor’ who attacked people at Portland veteran ceremony](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/female-mma-fighter-drops-anti-trump-professor-who-attacked-people-at-portland-veteran-ceremony/). In general, Law Enforcement Today publishes news that is far-right biased and often uses poor sources with poor fact-checking records.
