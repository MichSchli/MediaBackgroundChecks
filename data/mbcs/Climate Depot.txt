History
ClimateDepot.com is the website of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) employee Marc Morano, a conservative global warming denier who previously served as environmental communications director for a vocal political denier of climate change, Republican Sen. James Inhofe.
According to their
[about page](https://www.climatedepot.com/about/) “ClimateDepot.com, spearheaded by Morano, will serve as an information clearinghouse and one-stop shopping for reporters, policymakers, students, scientists and concerned citizens to get the latest information on global warming and other key environmental and energy issues.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Climate Depot is owned and published through CFACT, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is mostly funded through the
[Donor’s Trust](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/14/donors-trust-funding-climate-denial-networks). The [purpose](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/3/3/inside-donorstrust-what-this-mission-driven-daf-offers-phila.html) of the Donor’s Trust Fund is to “safeguard the intent of libertarian and conservative donors.” In other words, it allows anti-climate change advocates to donate anonymously. In the past, CFACT received over $500,000 from [Exxon-Mobil](https://exxonsecrets.org/html/orgfactsheet.php?id=25).
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Climate Depot publishes news and information from other sources regarding deregulation and human-influenced
[climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). There is very little original content present with the purpose of the website serving as a depot to other sources who report on climate change. Occasionally, Climate Depot will summarize the article or offer up opinions regarding the story.
The sources utilized, range from credible scientific sources such as
[NASA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nasa/), however most of the time they rely on other human-influenced Climate Change Denial sources such as [Judith Curry](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-etc/), [Watts Up with That](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/watts-up-with-that/), and the right-leaning source [Twitchy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/twitchy/). In general, the majority of stories/information published on this website are opposed to the [consensus of science](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) regarding climate change.
