History
[The Albuquerque Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque_Journal) traces its history to 1880. It is the successor to a newspaper called the Golden Gate, established in June of that year. In the fall of 1880, the owner of the Golden Gate died, and the Journal Publishing Company was founded. The daily paper’s name was changed to the Albuquerque Journal in 1925 when an independent editorial policy was established.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Albuquerque Journal reports local news through journalists using minimally loaded headlines such as this:
[NM oil production hit record high in 2018](https://www.abqjournal.com/1290986/nm-oil-production-hit-new-record-in-2018.html). Information in articles is typically well-sourced. National News comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Editorially, the topic selection is mainly balanced with slightly more leaning right. Further, the Albuquerque Journal has a long history of endorsing Republican candidates. [For example](https://ballotpedia.org/Albuquerque_Journal), the editorial board of the Albuquerque Journal “endorsed Republican presidential candidates including former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in 2012, U.S. Sen. John McCain in 2008 and President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.”
