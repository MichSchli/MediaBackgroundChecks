Analysis / Bias
In review,
[“Green America’s 2019 Toxic Textiles Report](https://www.greenamerica.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/GA_TextilesReport_Final_0.pdf?_gl=1*1je1b23*_gcl_au*NzgxMjcwNDc1LjE3MDIxMzk1MzA.*_ga*NDQ0MTY2MDkyLjE3MDIxMzk1MzA.*_ga_HTNVK3BTWB*MTcwMjIxODI3NS4zLjEuMTcwMjIyMDQzNS42MC4wLjA.&_ga=2.228892060.1456854429.1702139530-444166092.1702139530), in line with its environmental and social justice mission, critiques the textile industry, focusing on the impacts of toxic chemicals. It cites sources such as [Quartz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quartz/), the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, [the EPA,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/environmental-protection-agency-epa-bias/) and the UN. Green America also analyzes publicly available corporate information like CSR reports (the final pages of the report) to evaluate the sustainability practices of major fashion companies like VF Corporation and URBN, along with Walmart. The report provides essential statistics on pollution, recycling, and labor. However, its reliance on public data may not fully capture the complexities of global supply chains, potentially leading to subjective assessments of corporate sustainability practices.
Another report, “
[Bank Regulators: Step Up!](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/bank-regulators-step?btype=green_america_blog)” discusses the role of bank regulators in addressing climate change and calls for more robust regulatory action, aligning with Green America’s environmental advocacy. The blog post mentions specific regulatory bodies and policies and cites carbontracker.org, Fdic.gov, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [(NOAA)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration-noaa/), and [E&E News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ee-news-bias/).
Both articles reflect Green America’s left-leaning bias on environmental sustainability and social justice, using emotionally loaded language suitable for advocacy content. Their bias might skew their interpretation of data, but their factual reporting and clean fact-check history show commitment to scientific evidence.
