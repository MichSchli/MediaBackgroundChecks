Analysis / Bias
The Tampa Bay Times publishes original news and investigative reporting covering the Tampa Bay and Florida region. National and International news is republished through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Original local and state news is delivered with minimal bias in wording and story selection: [Motorcyclist hospitalized, lanes closed after accident on U.S. 19 in Pinellas Park](https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/10/24/motorcyclist-hospitalized-lanes-closed-after-accident-on-us-19-in-pinellas-park/). When covering political news, they often report with neutral wording: [Ron DeSantis endorses Florida bills allowing college athletes to make money](https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/10/24/ron-desantis-endorses-florida-bills-allowing-college-athletes-to-make-money/).
Editorially, The Tampa Bay Times typically endorses Democratic candidates. For example, they have
[endorsed](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/) the Democratic Presidential Candidate every time since 1980. Further, in local elections, such as in 2018, they endorsed all Democratic candidates. A review of the Opinion section also reveals a left-leaning bias with most editorials favorable to liberal policies such as this: [Two steps up, one step back on Florida voting rights | Editorial](https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2019/10/23/two-steps-up-one-step-back-on-florida-voting-rights-editorial/). The Tampa Bay Times generally reports news factually and with minimal bias; however, editorially, they lean moderately left.
