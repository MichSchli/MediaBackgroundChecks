Analysis / Bias
In review, the American Medical Association is one of the largest lobbying groups in the USA spending millions each election cycle. According to
[Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/) they fund both Democratic and Republican candidates, however historically they fund Republicans more. For example, in 2016, they funded [63.25% to Republican Candidates](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recipients?candscycle=2016&toprecipscycle=2020&id=D000000068). The primary aim of the AMA is to maximize doctors’ earnings. As such they are [opposed to universal single-payer health care](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/patient-support-advocacy/ama-vision-health-care-reform) but do support the Affordable Care Act and the goal of insuring as many people as possible.
The website publishes news that is generally geared toward physicians and medical practices such as this
[Physician practices are losing out in the scramble for PPE](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/physician-practices-are-losing-out-scramble-ppe). They also publish medicine-related news that often links to other sources such as [Johns Hopkins University](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/johns-hopkins-medicine/). While they don’t report directly on politics, they do provide opinions on policy that is sometimes favorable of President Trump, such as this [AMA applauds Trump Administration’s creation of opioids commission](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-applauds-trump-administrations-creation-opioids-commission). However, they also take a pro-science approach that is not in line with the Trump administration such as [not recommending hydroxychloroquine](https://www.politifact.com/amastatement/). They have also opposed President Trump on family planning, [AMA, Planned Parenthood Challenge Trump Family-Planning Rule](https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/03/05/ama-planned-parenthood-challenge-trump-family-planning-rule/). In general, the AMA is a lobbying association that favors doctors but promotes pro-science medical information.
