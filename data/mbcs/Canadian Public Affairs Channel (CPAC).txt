History

They have invested more than $50 million to create and preserve this editorially [independent voice](https://www.facebook.com/pg/CPACTV/about/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&ref=page_internal).

Analysis / Bias
CPAC provides coverage of public and government affairs through streaming proceedings of the House of Commons of Canada, centered around politics just like the USA’s
[C-SPAN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/c-span/) and BBC Parliament of the UK. [According to Canadian Business Journal](http://www.cbj.ca/cable_public_affairs_channel/), Colette Watson, President and General Manager of CPAC, says, “Our objective is to provide Canadians with the full, unfiltered story and let them make up their minds.” Further, she added that CPAC realizes this by allowing “Canadians to provide their own context, and our owners believe this is a wonderful and necessary public service to keep democracy alive.”
In reviewing news content on the website, there was minimal bias present, and all articles were sourced from the
