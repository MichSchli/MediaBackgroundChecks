Analysis / Bias
In our review of content from Vigilant News, they frequently promote conspiracy theories. For instance, one article titled
[“Ed Dowd Makes Chilling Prediction on How the COVID Conspirators Will Cover Up Their Crimes”](https://vigilantnews.com/post/ed-dowd-makes-chilling-prediction-on-how-the-covid-conspirators-will-cover-up-their-crimes) presents speculative claims without sufficient evidence. Furthermore, cited sources such as [Daily Clout](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dailyclout-bias/) and [Rumble](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rumble/) have a history of factually questionable reporting.
The article employs a conspiratorial tone when it states, “Dowd refers to the ‘tipping point’ as the moment the public becomes aware of COVID ‘vaccine’ harms.” It implies a hidden truth about vaccine harms and suggests an impending revelation that will demand accountability. This framing implies a conspiracy theory by assuming the existence of a hidden, dangerous truth that will eventually be exposed.
The website often features content related to
[interviews](https://vigilantnews.com/post/tucker-carlson-interviews-the-man-who-claims-he-had-sex-with-barack-obama) by [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/), known for his conservative viewpoints, indicating a specific editorial stance. Vigilant News frequently uses sensational, tabloid-style headlines with emotionally charged language to attract readers. Additionally, the articles often contain fewer words and rely more on videos and pictures for content delivery, as seen in their post featuring an [interview](https://vigilantnews.com/post/the-video-youtube-doesnt-want-you-to-see-mike-tyson-interviews-robert-kennedy-jr) between Mike Tyson and [Robert Kennedy Jr.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) This approach may prioritize emotional engagement over factual depth.
An article titled
[“Why Are There So Many Fires? Dr. David Martin Unveils What He Thinks Is Behind It”](https://vigilantnews.com/post/why-are-there-so-many-fires-dr-david-martin-unveils-what-he-thinks-is-behind-it) redefines the Dust Bowl as a banking crisis, not an environmental catastrophe. The quote, “Dr. Martin suggested that this wave of fires is not just a mere natural calamity, but that a deeper, darker agenda is at play,” adds a conspiratorial tone, inviting readers to question mainstream narratives and potentially deepen their skepticism towards conventional explanations.
While most conspiracy theories are related to Covid-19, they also promote political misinformation, such as the
[false claims](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) of a stolen election: [Tucker Carlson Makes Chilling Prediction on How the Democrats Will Try to Steal the 2024 Election](https://vigilantnews.com/post/tucker-carlson-makes-chilling-prediction-on-how-the-democrats-will-try-to-steal-the-2024-election). In general, Vigilant news holds far-right-leaning biases and is not always fact-based.
