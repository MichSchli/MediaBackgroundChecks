Analysis / Bias
Canary Mission has been
[accused](https://dailycollegian.com/2023/11/the-canary-missions-doxxing-needs-to-stop/) of demonizing pro-Palestine students and activists. The website’s [profiles](https://canarymission.org/professors) of people often lead to significant consequences for those listed, including emotional and psychological stress, potential impacts on career opportunities, and even FBI investigations. The site’s tactics have been characterized as scare tactics aimed at deterring support for Palestinian rights. The evidence used in their profiles is frequently derived from social media and has been criticized for [inaccuracy](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/canary-mission-mystery-website-demonising-pro-palestine-students-exposed).
The website features a blog that highlights news focusing on crimes against Israelis. The wording is often highly emotional, like this:
[The Vicious Response to the Murder of a Jew](https://canarymission.org/blog/Vicious_Response_To_Murder_Of_A_Jew). The website also promotes conspiracy theories directed at other Jews who do not support Israel enough, such as this [Question: Is Soros Himself AntiSemitic?](https://canarymission.org/blog/Is_Criticizing_George_Soros_Antisemitic) The article states: “Soros, through his [Open Society Foundations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/open-society-foundations/), has given tens of millions of dollars to BDS-supporting NGOs whose sole purpose is to destroy the state of Israel and undermine not only Israel’s right to self-defense but its very right to exist.”
In general, the sole purpose of this site is to Doxx individuals and groups who support Palestine. Doxxing students and professors who support Palestine can lead to harassment and threats and have a negative effect on free speech and academic freedom. It exposes individuals to public scrutiny and potential danger for expressing their political beliefs, undermining the principles of open dialogue and diversity of thought in educational environments.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years. However, the controversy surrounding its tactics and the impact on individuals suggests a pattern of aggressive targeting rather than objective reporting.
