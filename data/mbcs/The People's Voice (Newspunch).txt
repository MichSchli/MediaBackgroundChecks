Analysis / Bias
The People’s Voice (aka YourNewsWire, Newspunch) is a far-right-wing conspiracy and pseudoscience website that routinely publishes fake news. Headlines use loaded emotional language such as this:
[I Was In The Illuminati I’m Going To Tell You Everything, Shocking Expose.](https://newspunch.com/i-was-in-the-illuminati-im-going-to-tell-you-everything-shocking-expose/) Politically, story selection almost always favors the right through negative stories regarding liberal policy and politicians: [CIA Insider: Hillary Clinton Most Treasonous Leader In History.](https://newspunch.com/cia-insider-hillary-clinton-treason/) Further, the sources utilized by The People’s Voice are some of the least credible out there, such as [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
The People’s Voice routinely publishes
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), stories of impending [world war 3](https://newspunch.com/world-war-3-will-be-the-end-of-civilization-warns-putin/), and [extraterrestrial stories](https://newspunch.com/nasa-scientist-truth-aliens/), to name a few. Further, YourNewsWire (Now The People’s Choice) has made [Factcheck.org’s fake news list,](http://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/websites-post-fake-satirical-stories/) as well as having an [abysmal track record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/yournewswirecom/) with fact-checkers. Finally, [according to Poynter Institute](https://www.poynter.org/news/fact-checkers-have-debunked-fake-news-site-80-times-its-still-publishing-facebook), YourNewsWire (The People’s Voice) has more false claims by [IFCN fact-checkers](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/) than any other website.
