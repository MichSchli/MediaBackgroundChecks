Analysis / Bias
TheDailyWorld.Net mostly publishes sensational unsubstantiated claims like this
[During archaeological digs that began in the 1880s, an archaeologist discovered a human skeleton that stood 7 meters tall and had horns](https://thedailyworld.net/during-archaeological-digs-that-began-in-the-1880s-an-archaeologist-discovered-a-human-skeleton-that-stood-7-meters-tall-and-had-horns/). The headline of this story is very misleading as it gives the potential reader the idea that it may be true. In fact, in the article, they quote a [fact-checker who debunks that claim](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/04/04/fact-check-horned-humans-skeletons-with-gigantism-not-found-1800-s/7151442001/). The sole purpose of this story is to deceptively encourage clicking (clickbait).
As stated above, many stories involve alien lifeforms, such as this
[A Strange Animal Has Been Discovered on Mars by the Curiosity Rover of NASA (Video)](https://thedailyworld.net/a-strange-animal-has-been-discovered-on-mars-by-the-curiosity-rover-of-nasa-video/) and [In Alaska, There Are Highly Advanced UFOs Along With Mysterious Alien Bases.](https://thedailyworld.net/in-alaska-there-are-highly-advanced-ufos-along-with-mysterious-alien-bases-2/) There is no evidence to support either of these claims.
In general, TheDailyWorld.Net publishes conspiracies and pseudoscience that usually are not true.
