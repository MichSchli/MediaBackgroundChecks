Analysis / Bias
[The Kurdistan Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Region) is an autonomous region in Northern Iraq. This region is divided into four governorates: Duhok, Erbil, Sulaymaniya, and Halabja. Erbil is the Capital city. The Kurdistan Region has a presidential system with the current president Nechirvan Barzani. The [KDP](https://www.kdp.info/p/p.aspx?p=1&l=12&s=010000&r=344) is one of the main Kurdish parties in Iraq and is described as a tribal (Note tribes are KDP-Barzanis and the PUK-Talabani’s), considered the [leftist nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Democratic_Party) big tent party.
In review, Shafaq News utilizes headlines with strong, emotionally loaded language and a pro-President N. Barzani tone. For example, in the article
[“Nechirvan Barzani’s diplomatic steps “ Art of Possible](https://www.shafaaq.com/en/report/nechirvan-barzani-s-diplomatic-steps-art-of-possible/),” the president is pictured as a deal maker and perfect “As usual, President of Kurdistan Region, Nechirvan Barzani openly searches for common areas to enhance understandings between opponents and open doors of dialogue and common solutions.” The article is sourced through quotes from an interview with the President’s adviser. Shafaq News utilizes credible news sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), Unicef, and Government sources such as in this article [“Will Al-Kadhimi be able to end the Iraqi headache?”.](https://www.shafaaq.com/en/report/will-al-kadhimi-be-able-to-end-the-iraqi-headache/) However, they rarely use hyperlinks when sourcing outside information. In general, Shafaq promotes propaganda and is highly censored by the government.
