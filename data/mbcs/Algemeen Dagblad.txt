Analysis / Bias
In 2022,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Netherlands 28/180 in their [Press Freedom Index.](https://rsf.org/en/netherlands) Currently, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands is Mark Rutte, who leans [center-right](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/1029/Pragmatic-Rutte-to-lead-new-Dutch-coalition-government) (Conservative Liberalism is the equivalence of Center-Right in the USA), and he is also the leader of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VDV).
In review, Algemeen Dagblad or AD reports news with balance, representing all sides in politics. AD utilizes headlines with emotionally loaded language regarding the current prime minister, such as
[“Mark Rutte has risen as a guardian of the nation in times of crisis.”](https://www.ad.nl/politiek/mark-rutte-is-opgestaan-als-hoeder-van-de-natie-in-crisistijd~a38f5bed/) They also publish articles with a similar tone regarding the opposition party “ [Marijnissen (SP) opens attack on ‘lavender politics’ Baudet.”](https://www.ad.nl/politiek/marijnissen-sp-opent-aanval-op-lavendelpolitiek-baudet~a3bf9497/) Lilian Marijnissen is the leader of the left-wing socialist party. On issues such as immigration, they publish positively toned articles such as [“Sun gives immigrant from a warm country a ‘home feeling.’”](https://www.ad.nl/eindhoven/zon-geeft-immigrant-uit-warm-land-thuisgevoel~a735acfb/)
When it comes to sourcing, AD often hyperlinks to itself and credible sources such as
[WHO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/) and government agencies or universities such as the Institute for Security and Crisis Management COT. When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a neutral tone, such as in this article [“Donald Trump: I am not responsible for incidents involving cleaning products](https://www.ad.nl/buitenland/donald-trump-ik-ben-niet-verantwoordelijk-voor-incidenten-met-schoonmaakmiddelen~a29c9a70/).” In general, Algemeen Dagblad reports news factually and with minimal bias.
