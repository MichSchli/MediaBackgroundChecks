Analysis / Bias
Conservative Brief publishes news and commentary on USA politics favorable toward former President Trump and conservatives. They do not publish original reporting but rather take an existing story and add conservative commentary. Articles and headlines usually contain emotionally charged wording such as this
[Kamala Harris Whines That She’s Only Unpopular Because Of Racism And Sexism](https://conservativebrief.com/harris-whines-56962/). In another story, they denigrate Democrats [White House Has To Fix Another Biden Lie, President Misquoted Manchin](https://conservativebrief.com/president-manchin-56907/). When it comes to sourcing they generally use a credible source such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/).
In June 2021, Conservative Brief advanced
[Tucker Carlson’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) baseless conspiracy theory that the FBI was involved in the January 6th riots. However, Conservative Brief has improved its journalistic practices by correcting the story [CORRECTED HEADLINE: Tucker Carlson Offer Unverified Theory On January 6](https://conservativebrief.com/tucker-carlson-fbi-42941/). Further, the list of failed fact checks seen below has either been removed from the website or corrected.
Conservative Brief generally publishes highly right biased opinion content; however, most stories are rooted in fact and earn a mostly factual rating.
