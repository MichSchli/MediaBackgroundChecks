History
[Founded in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cop_Block), Cop Block is a grassroots Libertarian anti-police misconduct organization working to make police accountable for their actions. The organization’s members and volunteers attempt to draw attention to alleged or evident police abuses that happen across the United States and work to film police to force transparency and accountability within their ranks, as well as the complete abolishment of all law enforcement. [On October 11, 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/11/tech/facebook-removes-pages/), Cop Block became 1 of 559 pages and 251 accounts purged by Facebook for allegedly engaging in spam and “coordinated inauthentic activity” by creating “sensational political content…to build an audience and drive traffic to their websites.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
