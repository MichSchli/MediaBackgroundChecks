Analysis / Bias
Based on the articles from Law for Palestine, the site covers a range of topics related to international law, the rights of the Palestinian people, and the situation in Gaza.
The article
[“New Global Initiative Aims for Justice and Accountability in Palestine.”](https://law4palestine.org/new-global-initiative-aims-for-justice-and-accountability-in-palestine/) discusses a new global initiative aimed at justice and accountability for Palestine, acknowledging the conflict’s severe impact on the Palestinian population, including casualties, injuries, and displacement, and suggesting a strong advocacy stance for Palestinian rights and legal recourse. The article is supported by references from [ohchr.org](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/11/gaza-un-experts-call-international-community-prevent-genocide-against#:~:text=The%20experts%20also%20raised%20the,in%20the%20occupied%20West%20Bank.) and advocacy organizations like the [European Legal Support Center (ELSC)](https://elsc.support/) and [The Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy (PIPD).](https://www.thepipd.com/about-us/)
Another critical piece provides a summary of a UN Special Rapporteur’s
[report](https://law4palestine.org/summary-of-the-un-special-rapporteurs-report-on-the-palestinian-right-to-self-determination/) on Palestinian self-determination, offering a critique of the Israeli occupation and advocating for a strategic shift to tackle the root causes of the conflict. The call for recognizing [Palestinian self-determination](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-196558/) and condemning the ongoing occupation and settlements as violations of international law reflects a rights-based approach to the issue.
Additionally, Dr. Shahd Hammouri’s article,
[“The Palestinian people have the right of resistance by all means consistent with the principles of the UN Charter](https://law4palestine.org/the-palestinian-people-have-the-right-to-resistance-by-all-means-available-at-their-disposal-dr-shahd-hammouri/), argues for the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance within the framework of international law, emphasizing the right to resist occupation and the need for international recognition of this right. It distinguishes between the use of force in self-defense and the right to resist occupation, positioning Palestinian resistance within the context of international legal norms and the UN Charter. Sources cited are [Amnesty International](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/amnesty-international/), adalah.org, and [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/).
These articles reflect Law for Palestine’s focus on legal analysis and advocacy related to the Palestinian cause, employing a rights-based language and calling for international legal mechanisms to address and resolve the conflict. These views indicate a left-leaning bias.
