History
[Launched in 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN), C-SPAN offers live, unfiltered access to the congress and straightforward government news. C-Span also provides a morning call-in talk show called [Washington Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-journal/) that discusses government and political issues. The C-SPAN network includes three television channels (C-SPAN, C-SPAN2, and C-SPAN3), one radio station (WCSP-FM), and a group of websites that provide streaming media and archives of C-SPAN programs.
According to the website,
[the mission](https://www.c-span.org/about/mission/) is to “provide C-SPAN’s audience access to the live gavel-to-gavel proceedings of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and to other forums where public policy is discussed, debated and decided––all without editing, commentary or analysis and with a balanced presentation of points of view.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
C-SPAN is a private, nonprofit organization owned by the
[National Cable Satellite Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN), “funded by a 6¢ per subscriber affiliate fee paid by its cable and satellite affiliates, and does not have advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations, or websites, nor does it ever solicit donations or pledges. The network operates independently, and neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of its programming content.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, C-SPAN programming is quite literally a camera pointed at congressional events. Headlines on the website use straightforward, non-biased language:
[Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Testifies on President’s 2020 Budget Request](https://www.c-span.org/video/?458653-1/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-testifies-presidents-2020-budget-request&live). The website also provides video clips and transcripts from the morning call-in show, [Washington Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-journal/), which we have rated as Least Biased.
In general, C-SPAN is unfiltered and minimally biased. It should be noted that politicians frequently lie and mislead on C-SPAN, but that is not their fault. They point the camera and record whatever claims they are making.
