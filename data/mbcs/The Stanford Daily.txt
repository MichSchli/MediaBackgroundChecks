Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the content, The Stanford Daily publishes news about Stanford University and its surrounding community. The news reporting is generally factual and presents a balanced view of issues. For example, in the article
[“SLS faculty analyze Supreme Court decision to strike affirmative action,”](https://stanforddaily.com/2023/07/18/sls-faculty-analyze-supreme-court-decision-to-strike-affirmative-action/) the author provides a comprehensive analysis of the Supreme Court’s decision on affirmative action, quoting various law professors and their perspectives. It is well-sourced, with hyperlinks to government sources (supremecourt.gov, tile.loc.gov) referencing key historical court decisions related to affirmative action, such as Regents of the University of California v. Bakke and Grutter v. Bollinger, to provide context for the current ruling. However, The article’s emphasis on the need for a comprehensive approach beyond race-based affirmative action demonstrates a pro-affirmative-action stance, which is often associated with left-leaning perspectives.
Another article,
[“Law School activists protest Judge Kyle Duncan’s Visit to Campus,](https://stanforddaily.com/2023/03/11/law-school-activists-protest-judge-kyle-duncans-visit-to-campus/)” reports about a protest against a visiting conservative judge. This article presents a real-time account of the protest using neutral language and factual reporting. This type of reporting relies on direct quotes instead of depending heavily on hyperlinks or external sources.
Additionally,
[Theo Baker](https://news.yahoo.com/q-stanford-freshman-brought-down-110040314.html), Investigations Editor at Stanford Daily, won the George Polk Award for exposing image manipulation in research linked to University President Marc Tessier-Lavigne.
