Analysis / Bias

[Optogenetic manipulation identifies the roles of ERK and AKT dynamics in controlling mouse embryonic stem cell exit from pluripotency](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(23)00183-1).

[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Developmental Cell Journal is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, Cell Press has been criticized for [retracting some studies.](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cell/)
Although Cell Press has retracted some studies in other publications, Developmental Cell Journal publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
