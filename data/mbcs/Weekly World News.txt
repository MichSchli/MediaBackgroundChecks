Analysis / Bias
Weekly World News publishes a combination of strange (real) news stories and utterly fake news. The publication intends to be sensational and humorous. A sample headline reads
[U.S. PLANNING ARMY OF BAT BOY CLONES!](https://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/183677/u-s-planning-army-of-bat-boy-clones/)
When covering politics/politicians, they cover both sides, such as this
[ASS BACKWARDS MAN SUPPORTS TRUMP](https://weeklyworldnews.com/memeable/182161/ass-backwards-man-supports-trump/) and this making fun of President Biden [PRESIDENT BIDEN SALUTES ABE LINCOLNS GHOST](https://weeklyworldnews.com/memeable/182165/president-biden-salutes-abe-lincolns-ghost/). However, you can find more attacking former President Trump, indicating a left-leaning bias.
Although Weekly World News does not state that they are a satire site, they make it clear on its about page that they are not to be taken seriously with this “Weekly World News is the only publication in the world to cover the exploits of Bat Boy, Manigator, The Lake Erie Monster, Ph.D. Ape, P’Lod the Alien, Itty Bitty Elephants, Bigfoot Hooker, and many other beings that the mainstream media refuses to cover.”
In general, Weekly World News is a satire site that publishes a mix of sensational/humorous articles and outright made-up news.
