Analysis / Bias
In review, WNYC hosts more than 40 podcasts broadcast on NPR stations around the country. Put another way, this is ground zero for NPR. The website provides original reporting using minimally loaded wording such as this
[An Expert On Biden’s COVID-19 Task Force Weighs In On A National — And Local — Coronavirus Strategy](https://www.wnyc.org/story/what-covid-19-response-will-look-under-biden-harris-administration). All stories reviewed are properly sourced to credible or low-biased media.
Editorially, they do not have a dedicated opinion section, but story selection tends to lean left, such as this
[ Politics with Amy Walter: A Presidential Transition Delayed](http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/politics-amy-walter-presidential-transition-delayed/). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias.
