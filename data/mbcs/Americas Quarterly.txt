Analysis / Bias
[Brasilwire.com](http://www.brasilwire.com/boycott-americas-quarterly-and-ascoa/) describes Americas Quarterly as “Beyond its connections to US Government, holding a yearly event at the State Department itself, publisher of Americas Quarterly, AS/COA (Americas Society / Council of the Americas) is home not only to the major banks, extractive corporations and tech giants, but also the main platforms with which to propagandize on Latin America in the interests of its patrons, such as Bloomberg.”
In review, Americas Quarterly utilizes loaded language in its headlines:
[“The Summit of the Unpopular and the Lame Ducks.”](http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/summit-unpopular-and-lame-ducks) In the body of the article, the language is emotionally loaded as well: “Adding to the sensation that this summit will offer little in the way of substance is the fact that several marquee attendees will soon be lame ducks. The leaders of Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, the three most populous countries in Latin America, are in the final stretch of their terms.”
When reporting on other Latin American countries, they utilize local sources related to the specific country. For example, when their article or analysis is about Costa Rica, they use larepublica.net or nacion.com as their source, which we have not rated for credibility.
They source thoroughly, utilizing credible sources such as
[The New Yorker,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/) [Huff Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and [Reuters when it comes to US politics.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) Politically, AQ is pro-free markets and free trade as well as somewhat pro-conservative: [“The Truth About Trump and Latin America There’s far more sympathy for Trump’s worldview than you might think writes AQ’s editor in chief.”](http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/truth-about-trump-and-latin-america)
