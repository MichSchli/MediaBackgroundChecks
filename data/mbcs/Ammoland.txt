Analysis / Bias
In review, Ammoland typically only reports on the gun industry, guns sports, and the 2nd Amendment issue. When reporting on non-political matters, Ammoland uses a neutral tone; however, when reporting on politics, there is a strong use of loaded emotional language that favors the right, such as this:
[March For Our Lives Has A Peace Plan, And It’s A Horror for America](https://www.ammoland.com/2019/08/march-for-our-lives-a-peace-plan-a-horror/#axzz5yHDFHZcl). This story is correctly sourced to the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Our World in Data](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/our-world-in-data/), and Australian Government statistics. In an op-ed, [How Can The Left & Right Agree On Guns? Don’t Even Try! They Can’t!](https://www.ammoland.com/2019/08/how-can-left-right-agreement-about-guns-they-cant/) there is significant use of loaded emotional language that denigrates the left by routinely calling liberals “Radical Leftists.” This op-ed also does not hyperlink to a single source.
In another article,
[Every Mass Shooting Shares One Thing In Common & It’s NOT Weapons](https://www.ammoland.com/2013/04/every-mass-shooting-in-the-last-20-years-shares-psychotropic-drugs/#ixzz5w1kt9DRD), they promote a [conspiracy theory](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/aug/16/whats-behind-dubious-claim-psychiatric-drugs-fuel-/) that claims that gun manufacturer John Noveske died under suspicious circumstances for exposing the link between prescription drugs and mass-casualty shootings. This has never been substantiated. In general, when reporting on guns and sport, Ammoland is low biased and factually sourced; however, when reporting on political issues, there is a very strong right-leaning bias that is mostly factual.
