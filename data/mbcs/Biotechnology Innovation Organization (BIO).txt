Analysis / Bias
Biotechnology Innovation Organization does not post news related to politics but instead focuses on advocacy for the advancement of biotechnology. They do have a section on the website called
[News & Reports](https://www.bio.org/insights), where they opine primarily about healthcare news. In some cases, they have a favorable view of Trump’s policies, such as [here](https://www.bio.org/press-release/bio-applauds-president-trumps-directive-allow-sales-e15-fuel-year-round) and others, where they [vilify his policies](https://www.bio.org/press-release/bio-statement-administration%E2%80%99s-drug-pricing-proposal) towards health care. Everything on this website is well-sourced and related to science or the politics that drive it.
