Analysis / Bias
A review of one of their articles,
[“How the U.S.’ State Sponsors of Terrorism List’ Reinforces the Illegal Blockade of Cuba,”](https://inkstickmedia.com/how-the-us-state-sponsors-of-terrorism-list-reinforces-the-illegal-blockade-of-cuba/#:~:text=,) suggests a critical perspective on U.S. foreign policy. It challenges the official U.S. stance and emphasizes the negative consequences of its policies. The article incorporates historical references, such as the Cuban Revolution and the Cuban-Five incident, to contextualize its critique. Furthermore, it discusses U.S. government involvement in covert operations and interventions in Latin America.
The sources used in the article include official platforms such as state.gov and cubaminrex.cu (the official site of Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs). It also contains publications with varying factual ratings, such as
[The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/) (rated left and mostly factual), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) (rated left and mostly factual), and [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), [Fox News, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/)and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) (rated factually mixed).

Additionally, they reference specific advocacy-focused websites like [FreeTheFive.org](http://www.freethefive.org/) and [Cuba-solidarity.org.uk,](https://cuba-solidarity.org.uk/information/miami5/) which do not have a Media Bias/Fact Check rating but also contribute to the article’s narrative.
Another article titled
[“2024 Will See More Than 50 Elections Around the World. What Risk Does AI Pose?”](https://inkstickmedia.com/2024-will-see-more-than-50-elections-around-the-world-what-risk-does-ai-pose/) republished from the United States Institute of Peace, discusses the impact of AI on global politics and elections. It explores the potential for AI to spread misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories in international elections. Additionally, the article examines the use of AI in voter outreach and the risks associated with AI-generated deepfakes and chatbots.
Regarding bias and framing, the article presents a critical view of the role of AI in politics. This perspective is evident in the emphasis on the potential negative consequences of AI, such as the spread of misinformation and the creation of deepfakes. The language used is somewhat emotionally loaded, particularly when discussing deepfakes and their impact on women and minorities, highlighting the risks of digital harassment and online abuse. The article also addresses the challenges technology companies and governments face in managing the spread of false information facilitated by AI. The sources cited in the article support its arguments. References to
[Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Wired](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/), and [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kdka-cbs-pittsburgh/) provide evidence for the claims about AI’s role in elections and the issues with misinformation and deepfakes. The article also mentions efforts by entities like the [Ministry of Communication and Information Technology in Indonesia](https://www.thejakartapost.com/) and the [Digital Action](https://digitalaction.co/) nonprofit.
In summary, the article leans towards a critical and cautious viewpoint regarding the impact of AI on politics and elections, using various sources to back its claims.
Generally, Inkstick Media provides a platform for alternative and diverse perspectives on foreign policy, particularly those that may not be widely covered in mainstream media. However, the tone and focus of their content may lean towards a critical view of U.S. foreign policy and its global impact, which tends to be one-sided. While offering valuable insights, this approach may not always present a balanced view of complex geopolitical issues.
