Launched in 2005 by
[Dave Finocchio](https://www.fastcompany.com/3055487/in-bleacher-reports-changing-lineup-cofounder-dave-finocchio-returns-as-ceo) and his high school friends, Bleacher Report, or B/R, is a website that [focuses](https://bleacherreport.com/pages/about) on sports and sports culture and covers a wide range of sports-related topics. Bleacher report is headquartered in San Fransisco. [In the early days,](https://www.seattleweekly.com/news/how-bleacher-report-made-crap-journalism-pay/) Bleacher Report was primarily known for “churning out around 800 articles a day” and for featuring content from local sports blogs, many of whom were unpaid amateur writers.
Over time, the site expanded, and in 2012 Dave Finocchio, who co-founded Bleacher Report, sold it to Turner Broadcasting System. After the acquisition, Bleacher Report has grown into a network of sites. Turner

Analysis / Bias
In review, Bleacher Report produces original sports coverage and news sourced from other credible outlets such as
[USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), Sports Illustrated, [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), NBC Sports, ESPN, and occasionally questionable sources such as [TMZ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tmz/). Sports news reporting often does not use loaded words with the headline accurately describing the article, such as this: [Best Values at Each Position from NBA Re-Draft Series](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2890820-best-values-at-each-position-from-nba-re-draft-series).
Editorially, Bleacher Report does not produce opinion pieces. However, they cover sports-related politics with a left-leaning bias:
[Why Does President Donald Trump Hate the NFL?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2739587-why-does-president-donald-trump-hate-the-nfl) For example, many articles about politics favor the left, such as this: [MLB Hall of Famer Goose Gossage Rips Analytics: Like Democrats Running Baseball](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2879594-mlb-hall-of-famer-goose-gossage-rips-analytics-like-democrats-running-baseball). Within this article, they publish a tweet that mocks Gossage’s opinion of Democrats “Those pesky democrats with their math, science, and facts.” Finally, while Bleacher Report typically does not add commentary to articles, story selection more often favors the left such as this [DONALD TRUMP IS TEARING THE NFL APART](https://thelab.bleacherreport.com/donald-trump-is-tearing-the-nfl-apart/). Generally, the news is reported mostly factually with a left-leaning bias in story selection.
