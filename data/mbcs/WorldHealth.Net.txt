[American Academy of Anti-Aging, Preventative, and Regenerative Medicine](https://www.a4m.com/about-a4m-mmi.html), a nonprofit organization established in 1992 by Founding Doctors Ronald Klatz and Robert Goldman.

The A4M is also dedicated to educating physicians, scientists, and members of the public on biomedical sciences, breaking technologies, and anti-aging issues.”
The mission of WorldHealth.net is to “disseminate information concerning innovative science and research as well as treatment modalities designed to prolong the human lifespan.” However, the website also frequently publishes alternative health pseudoscience.

Analysis / Bias
In review, WorldHealth.Net claims to cover news about anti-aging, health, and medicine; however, most articles focus on
[alternative health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) and promote pseudoscience. For example, WorldHeath.Net has been publishing articles that detail questionable alternative ways to prevent or cure Covid-19, such as using herbs. They have also made [false claims](https://www.worldhealth.net/news/scientific-look-botanical-plants-and-supplements-against-coronavirus/): “Researchers investigated viral interference due to receiving the flu shot; in other words, does the flu vaccine make a recipient more susceptible to other non-influenza respiratory viral infections? The study states, “ [Vaccine-derived virus interference](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus.” Numerous credible fact-checkers have debunked this claim, [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-flu-vaccine-causes-new-coro/false-claim-the-flu-vaccine-causes-the-new-coronavirus-idUSKCN21X2LT) and [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/01/fact-check-flu-shot-coronavirus-not-connected-medical-experts-say/2933900001/).
Like other pseudoscience websites, they make
[outrageous claims regarding cures for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), such as this [Vitamin C linked to cancer cure](https://www.worldhealth.net/news/vitamin_c_linked_to_cancer_cure/). This story is not sourced. They also promote anti-vaccination propaganda such as this [Why Use Vaccine for HPV When Green Tea Works?](https://www.worldhealth.net/news/why_use_vaccine_for_hpv_when_green_tea_w/) This is sourced from alternative medicine quack Joseph [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/). Finally, WordHealth.Net does not support the consensus of science regarding [GMO safety](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), such as this [Is There A Link Between GMOs And WiFi Technology?](https://www.worldhealth.net/news/there-link-between-gmos-and-wifi-technology/) and frequently promotes [5G conspiracy theories](https://www.worldhealth.net/news/scientists-warn-about-health-effects-5g-goes/) that have been [debunked](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/5g-conspiracy-theories-debunked/).
