Analysis / Bias
In review, the First Coast News website covers local news through journalists often using television station videos. Headlines do not use loaded language such as this:
[Both right lanes of I-295 SB near Roosevelt Boulevard blocked due to crash with injuries](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/traffic/both-right-lanes-of-i-295-sb-near-roosevelt-boulevard-blocked-due-to-crash-with-injuries/77-3b1258b4-0f9d-4942-b8e2-30a021e380ac). National and world news is generally delivered through [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) videos.
Editorially and politically, the website does not publish opinion content. However, when reporting on politics, they typically rely on video and text from other TEGNA affiliates such as this:
[White House official: Trump will not testify in his own defense](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/politics/white-house-official-trump-will-not-testify-in-his-own-defense/77-0e922c11-e5ba-4449-a448-517bd4281c63). Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
