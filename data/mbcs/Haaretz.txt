Analysis / Bias
In review, Haaretz is known to have a
[liberal](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/28/the-dissenters) editorial stance. In 2017, however, they were also criticized by the left. For example, they published an [op-ed](https://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/.premium-1.4021723) titled “’religious Zionists’ are more dangerous to Israel than Hezbollah,” which caused Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-politicians-condemn-haaretz-in-response-to-op-ed-1.5460609) and the left of center labor party to denounce the article. Haaretz often has been critical of [Benjamin Netanyahu’s](https://jewishvirtuallibrary.org/benjamin-quot-bibi-quot-netanyahu) center-right government, such as in these editorials titled “ [Israel’s Snap Election Is a Makeup Exam for Democracy”](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/israel-s-snap-election-is-a-makeup-exam-for-democracy-1.7309293) and “ [Give Someone Else a Chance.”](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/give-someone-else-a-chance-1.7301845) When it comes to sourcing, they often hyperlink to themselves or use quotes; they also republish [Reuters and Associated Press articles](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/wires/1.7332531).
When covering world news about the USA, they use loaded language in their headlines, such as
[“Trump’s Peace Plan Could Be Called ‘Unexecutable,’ Pompeo Tells Jewish Leaders.”](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-s-peace-plan-could-be-called-unexecutable-mike-pompeo-tells-jewish-leaders-1.7315983) Opinion pieces regarding the USA tend to lean left, with members of the former Trump administration portrayed negatively through strong language such as this: [Opinion Jared Kushner Just Killed the Palestinian Peace Camp](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-jared-kushner-just-killed-the-palestinian-peace-camp-1.7317109). In general, Haaretz reports factual news with strongly left-leaning editorials.
During the Israel-Hamas conflict of 2023, Haaretz presented a balanced perspective with articles like this:
[Hamas Committed Documented Atrocities. But a Few False Stories Feed the Deniers.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-04/ty-article-magazine/.premium/hamas-committed-documented-atrocities-but-a-few-false-stories-feed-the-deniers/0000018c-34f3-da74-afce-b5fbe24f0000)
