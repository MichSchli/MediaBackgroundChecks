History
[Launched in 2019](https://whois.domaintools.com/gript.ie), Gript.ie is a conservative news and opinion website based in Ireland. [John McGuirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuirk) founded and edits the website. He is also a contributor to The Irish Catholic. According to their [about page](https://gript.ie/about/), “This headlong rush to the most extreme forms of liberalism, facilitated by the stifling of any real debate, should be a matter of concern to the public, and if you’re one of those who is worried about it, this is the place for you.” [Read our profile on Ireland’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ireland-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Gript website features videos, podcasts, and news articles written from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines sometimes contain moderately loaded language such as
[MINISTER FOR DISABILITIES SEEKS MORE DISABILITY ABORTIONS?](https://gript.ie/minister-for-disabilities-seeks-more-disability-abortions/) This opinion piece is sourced without hyperlinks from the [Irish Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-irish-examiner/). In a straight news article [TRUMP LABELS BIDEN “ENEMY OF THE STATE” IN FIRST SPEECH SINCE RAID](https://gript.ie/trump-labels-biden-enemy-of-the-state-in-first-speech-since-raid/) they rely on [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) as the source. A review of sourcing reveals that they usually rely on credible sources.
Editorially, Gript consistently favors conservative positions through
[Pro-Life](https://gript.ie/bodies-of-2000-unborn-babies-found-in-abortion-doctors-house/) advocacy, [immigration reforms](https://gript.ie/france-barnier-immigration/), and [climate change alarmism skepticism](https://gript.ie/the-medias-schizophrenia-on-climate-change/). For example, while Gript does not deny that climate change is human-influenced and occurring, they point out that the media is inconsistent in reporting on climate change. [In another story](https://gript.ie/i-cried-wolf-on-climate-change-stunning-revelation-from-leading-activist/), they quote Michael Shellenberger stating that “on behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologise for the climate scare we created over the past 30 years. Climate change is happening. It’s just not the end of the world. It’s not even our most serious environmental problem.” Again, they are not denying the earth is warming, but rather the severity of the warming and the potential consequences.
When reporting on Covid-19 and, in particular, vaccines, they have promoted non-peer reviewed studies such as this
[NEW STUDY: VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS 6 TIMES MORE DANGEROUS THAN COVID-19 HOSPITALISATION FOR TEENAGE BOYS](https://gript.ie/new-study-vaccine-side-effects-6-times-more-dangerous-than-covid-19-hospitalisation-for-teenage-boys/). This story references a study in which the [methodology and results](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/sep/20/doubts-raised-over-preprint-study-regarding-myocar/) have been questioned. It is important to note that they clearly indicate the study is not peer-reviewed.
Finally, Gript appropriately labels opinion content and has corrected or
[removed false/misleading](https://www.thejournal.ie/eamon-ryan-false-article-gript-5430856-May2021/) content. In general, Gript holds a conservative editorial bias and produces reasonably factual information and a willingness to correct errors. This update moves Gript from Questionable to Right Biased and mostly factual.
