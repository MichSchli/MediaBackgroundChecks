History
The National Review was founded in 1955 by the conservative editor, columnist, author, and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. (1925-2008). According to their
[about page](https://www.nationalreview.com/frequently-asked-questions/), the print magazine and website are corporately known as National Review, Inc. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Review Institute (NRI) based in New York City. The magazine’s website covers articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, opinion pieces, conservative news, and commentary in addition to the content published in its print version.
William F. Buckley Jr. appeared in a series of televised debates with Gore Vidal during the 1968 Republican National Convention, and this resulted in him
[suing Vidal](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/vidal-suit.html?_r=1&oref=slogin) and [Esquire Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/esquire-magazine/) due to Vidal calling Buckley “racist, anti-black, anti-semitic and a pro-crypto Nazi.” Buckley eventually settled with Esquire receiving a $115,000 payment, and dropped his suit against Vidal.

The National Review magazine and website are both owned by the
[National Review Institute.](https://nrinstitute.org/about-nri/board-of-trustees) William F. Buckley Jr. founded the National Review Institute as a nonprofit, and according to an [article](https://www.thenation.com/article/squire-willie/) from [The Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-nation/), the “National Review‘s biggest financial supporter, Roger Milliken was a Birch Society member. The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) describes the John Birch Society as a [conspiracist group,](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/bringing-back-birch) whereas the National Review [describes](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/roger-milliken-rip-john-j-miller/) Milliken as one of the “Right’s funding fathers.” According to [Sourcewatch,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2017/11/06/daily-source-bias-check-sourcewatch/) The National Review Institute has [received funding](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/National_Review_Institute) from the Charles G.

Analysis / Bias
The National Review Online describes itself as “America’s most widely read and influential magazine and web site for conservative news, commentary, and opinion.”
In review, the National Review Online frequently uses loaded emotional wording in headlines that favor the right such as
[Weapons of Mass Manipulation](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/06/talia-lavin-new-yorker-smears-war-veteran-justin-gaertner/). This article was written by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin who has made [false claims](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/13/michelle-malkin/did-white-house-brand-arizona-memorial-service-log/) according to fact-checkers. When reporting on President Trump, the National Review offers a reasonable balance of [pro-Trump](https://www.nationalreview.com/videos/president-trumps-8-biggest-accomplishments/) and [anti-Trump](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/06/trump-family-separation-policy-political-moral-malpractice/) articles, slightly favoring the President and his policies. National Review typically sources their information to known right-leaning sources but sometimes links to factually mixed sources such as [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/) and the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/). Editorially, they endorse conservative policy and politicians, such as Ted Cruz’s endorsement during the 2016 Presidential Election. Finally, story selection always favors the right while painting liberal policy negatively.
A factual search reveals that in this
[article](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/02/whistle-blower-scientist-exposes-shoddy-climate-science-noaa/), the National Review sourced the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4192182/World-leaders-duped-manipulated-global-warming-data.html) who [falsely reported](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/02/no-data-manipulation-at-noaa/) that NOAA manipulated climate data. This was later debunked by the person they were quoting (Dr. Bates). Further, the National Review did not include the actual statements that Dr. Bates made, which refute the Daily Mail and National Review’s claims of unverified and corrected data. [Bates said](https://apnews.com/3fc5d49a349344f1967aadc4950e1a91/major-global-warming-study-again-questioned-again-defended) there was “no data tampering, no data changing, nothing malicious.” “It’s really a story of not disclosing what you did,” Bates said in the interview. “It’s not trumped up data in any way, shape or form,” [FactCheck.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/factcheck/) concluded that the National Review’s article was misleading.
