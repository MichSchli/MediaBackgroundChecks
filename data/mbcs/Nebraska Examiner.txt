Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, the Nebraska Examiner is part of
[States Newsroom](https://statesnewsroom.com/about/), a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit [supported by grants and a coalition of donors and readers](https://statesnewsroom.com/support/). States Newsroom publishes 28 other [publications](https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/). The Nebraska Examiner is transparent as they link to the States Newsroom donors page. Initially, when they launched, they got fiscal sponsorship from the Hopewell Foundation; however, once the IRS approved their application for 501(c)(3) charity certification, they severed their ties with Hopewell Foundation. There has been criticism of their involvement with [the Hopewell Foundation,](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/mysterious-funders-behind-new-arizona-media-outlet-10870282) and they have responded to the criticism [here](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/a-few-friday-thoughts-on-what-the-arizona-mirror-is-and-isnt/).
Analysis / Bias
The Nebraska Examiner publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Nebraska. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects the people of Nebraska. Articles and headlines promote liberal perspectives through moderate, loaded language
[U.S. House approves $1.7 trillion funding package and sends it to Biden](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/12/23/u-s-house-approves-1-7-trillion-funding-package-and-sends-it-to-biden/).
They properly source, linking to credible sources such as
[whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), and bls.gov (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Editorially, opinion pieces favor the left, such as this
[Two recent polls found majority of Nebraska respondents oppose more abortion restrictions](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/12/28/two-recent-polls-found-majority-of-nebraska-respondents-oppose-more-abortion-restrictions/). On the issues, the Nebraska Examiner promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change. Finally, they frequently report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [Trump announces a third bid for the presidency, even as GOP reels from midterm setback](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/11/15/trump-announces-a-third-bid-for-the-presidency-even-as-gop-reels-from-midterm-setback/). The Nebraska Examiner generally reports news factually; however, story selection and op-eds strongly favor a liberal perspective.
