Analysis / Bias
In review, News18 publishes national news with strongly loaded emotional language such as this
[“What Explains PM Narendra Modi’s Silence Despite Criticism.”](https://www.news18.com/news/india/what-explains-pm-narendra-modis-silence-despite-criticism-3717071.html) This story does not contain hyperlinked sourcing. This editorial was written by [Brajesh Kumar Singh](https://www.news18.com/byline/brajesh-kumar-singh.html) and praised conservative PM Narendra Modi with quotes that read, “Those who watch Modi closely say that there is nothing new about this. Modi uses his silence as his weapon, and as the right opportunity arrives, he settles the score.” “Modi is a superstar on social media,” and “The fragmented opposition.” For sourcing, News18 utilizes The Press Trust of India Ltd news agency [“Indian-origin Woman Kicked, Hurled with Racial Abuses for Not Wearing Mask in Singapore.”](https://www.news18.com/news/world/singapore-man-hurls-racial-slurs-kicks-indian-origin-woman-for-not-wearing-mask-during-walk-3724205.html) [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [AFP (Agence France Presse)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and CNN provide international news. In general, there is a right-leaning editorial bias in favor of the conservative Prime Minister, while some news is not factually based.
