History
The Age is a daily newspaper from Melbourne, Australia, founded in 1854 by John and
[Henry Cooke and Walter Powell](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/on-our-165-birthday-a-look-back-at-our-very-first-editorial-20191015-p530u5.html). Two years later, they sold the paper to Ebenezer Syme and James McEwan. After Ebenezer passed away, [David Syme](https://books.google.com/books?id=Mydy7EJupzMC&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=the+age+his+brother+David+Syme&source=bl&ots=uWLD4X08t4&sig=ACfU3U3RgUNpqrSFQfNOvc-GgY3LkYKE9g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ9O3GiafqAhXwm-AKHZjUC0sQ6AEwGnoECBsQAQ#v=onepage&q=the%20age%20his%20brother%20David%20Syme&f=false) joined McEwan as a partner. David Syme eventually became the publisher and subsequently became the owner. Due to his managerial practices, The Age became profitable and reputable. After the death of David Syme, his sons took control of the paper. Finally, after the last son Oswald Syme passed away, his grandson Ranald Macdonald took control and appointed Graham Perkin as editor-in-chief.
Under their management, The Age became the most influential paper of its time.
[The Australian Dictionary of Biography](http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/perkin-edwin-graham-11370) (maintained by the Australian National University – ANU) states, “Perkin turned The Age into a more interventionist and campaigning newspaper. It exposed financial scandals in State governments and corruption in the police force and attacked Federal governments for suppressing information. In the process, it attracted critics who thought it too ‘leftist.’”
In 1972, John Fairfax Holdings started

As a result, Ranald Macdonald stepped down and was replaced by Greg Taylor. In 2018, Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax [announced](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-26/what-the-fairfax-and-nine-merger-means-for-you/10039236) that they would be merging, resulting in Nine shareholders retaining 51 percent ownership.

Analysis / Bias
In 2020,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Australia 26/180 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/australia) stating, [“Investigative journalism in danger](https://rsf.org/en/australia).” The Prime Minister of Australia is Center-Right Conservative [Scott Morrison](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45292331). [ The Liberal-National Coalition](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48331125), known as The Coalition, an alliance of center-right political parties with Morrison serving as the leader. In the 2019 elections, according to its [editorial](https://www.theage.com.au/national/shorten-has-made-a-compelling-case-for-change-20190516-p51o1a.html), The Age endorsed [Center Left](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-election-bill-shorten-profi/from-picket-line-to-pm-bill-shorten-aims-to-be-australian-leader-idUSKCN1SL0JF) Labor Party candidate Bill Shorten, [“Shorten has made a compelling case for change](https://www.theage.com.au/national/shorten-has-made-a-compelling-case-for-change-20190516-p51o1a.html).”
In review, The Age publishes opinion pieces that are critical of the Morrison government with strong emotionally loaded language such as
[“Bring in the Barbarians: the Morrison government is marching us towards anti-intellectualism.”](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/bring-in-the-barbarians-the-morrison-government-is-marching-us-towards-anti-intellectualism-20200627-p556s8.html) Editorials also feature emotionally loaded wording that is critical of the current government’s environmental [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) strategies, such as this article [“If Morrison wants climate credibility, he should be pushing electric vehicles.”](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/if-morrison-wants-climate-credibility-he-should-be-pushing-electric-vehicles-20200119-p53ss8.html) A quote from the article referring to Scott Morrison’s Government environment policies reads, “Put shortly, there is no strategy. There is no policy, no target, and so far little evidence of a plan.” However, the editorial is thoroughly sourced through credible sources such as “environment.gov.au” and [“Parliament of Australia.”](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Electric_Vehicles/ElectricVehicles/Report/c05) In general, The Age reports news factually and with a moderate left-leaning bias.
Finally, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 52% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 17% do not, ranking them #11 in trust of the major Australian news providers.
