History
Founded in 2016, the GOP Daily Brief is a right-leaning news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://gopdailybrief.com/about/), “Patriot Journal is dedicated to giving America-loving patriots access to the news the mainstream media won’t report. We aim to give our readers the right perspective on the political news of the day, no matter how unpopular it may be, written by hardworking Americans for hardworking Americans.” The Patriot Journal website does not list an editor but does provide some author bios.
Funded by / Ownership
The GOP Daily Brief does not list the owner of the website; however, the website is owned by Ryan Mauldin through
[Viral Media Partners LLC](https://domainbigdata.com/viralmediapartners.com). Ryan Mauldin also owns [Vici Media Group](http://profitablepropertymanagement.com/podcast/ryan-mauldin-vici-media-interview/), a political consulting company that has worked on several Republican campaigns, including former President Trump in 2016. Advertising and sponsored content generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the GOP Daily Brief does not produce original content but instead takes a story from a single, usually right-biased source and editorializes it. For example, in this story:
[Biden Finally Cracks Under Pressure From Protesters – Joe Breaks Down Over Their Signs, Claims 81 Million Voted For Him](https://gopdailybrief.com/biden-heckler-pressure-signs-81-million/) In this story, the primary sources are the right biased and Questionable [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). The website also breaks the news down into categories by singling out [Joe Biden](https://gopdailybrief.com/tag/joe-biden/) (which is negative) and [Donald Trump](https://gopdailybrief.com/tag/donald-trump/) (positive).
Editorially all stories favor the right and denigrate the left. Further, they have promoted false and misleading information regarding election fraud during the 2020 presidential election.
