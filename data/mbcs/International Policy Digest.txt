History
Founded by John Lyman in 2011, the International Policy Digest is a news commentary and analysis website focused on global affairs. According to their
[about page](https://intpolicydigest.org/about-us/), they have “a goal to give voice to writers worldwide who are often marginalized, IPD aims to put these writers at the forefront of an ever-churning global news cycle. On any given day, you will find articles that address the Asia Pacific or Middle East regions, as well as articles that address key U.S. policy.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
International Policy Digest publishes original commentary and analytical essays on global affairs, especially related to developing nations. News articles and headlines often do not contain emotional wording, such as this
[U.S.-Venezuelan Dialogue Frees Two Americans](https://intpolicydigest.org/u-s-venezuelan-dialogue-frees-two-americans/). However, when covering politics, the wording becomes more emotional, favoring the left, such as this [Why are Biden’s Critics So Dumb?](https://intpolicydigest.org/why-are-biden-s-critics-so-dumb/) Further, the information contained in the articles is appropriately sourced from credible media outlets such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), and [The Bulwark](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-bulwark/).
Editorially, the International Policy Digest favors a progressive perspective, often disagreeing with the Biden administration’s establishment views, such as this
[Trumpism with a Biden Face: U.S. Haitian Policy](https://intpolicydigest.org/trumpism-with-a-biden-face-u-s-haitian-policy/). However, they frequently report negatively on conservatives and former President Trump, such as this [The ‘Sore Loser Effect’: Rejecting Election Results can Destabilize Democracy and Drive Terrorism](https://intpolicydigest.org/the-sore-loser-effect-rejecting-election-results-can-destabilize-democracy-and-drive-terrorism/). In general, they report news factually and with a progressive left bias.
