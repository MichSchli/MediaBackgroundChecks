Analysis / Bias
The Unlimited Hangout website hosts Whitney Webb’s podcast and provides news and investigative journalism. Most investigations involve the deep state, new world order, and control by powerful elites. For example, they frequently report on the
[World Economic Forum](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/) and the “ [Great Reset](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/),” such as [The Covid-19 Celebrity Humanitarianism – Sean Penn and the Great Reset](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/11/investigative-reports/the-covid-19-celebrity-humanitarianism-sean-penn-and-the-great-reset-funded-by-bill-gates-and-the-clinton-foundation/).
During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have published stories such as this
[Covid-19 – Mass Formation or Mass Atrocity?](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/11/investigative-reports/covid-19-mass-formation-or-mass-atrocity/) This story relies on credible sources such as [StatNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stat-news/) and questionable sources like [Off-Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/swiss-policy-research/), [Rebel News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-rebel/), and [The Expose](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-expose/).
Editorially and politically, Unlimited Hangout goes after establishment parties and political figures like this

The website has also published Covid-19 misinformation resulting in YouTube removing a video [“Gene-Edited” Future Justified By COVID-19 & France Admits Athletes Infected At Wuhan Military Games](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/05/press/gene-edited-future-justified-by-covid-19-france-admits-athletes-infected-at-wuhan-military-games/). Finally, in another story, they promote false flag conspiracies such as this [Like Father, Like Son: How the Trudeaus Manufacture Crises to Justify “Emergency Measures](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2022/02/investigative-reports/like-father-like-son-how-the-trudeaus-manufacture-crises-to-justify-emergency-measures/).” A quote from the article reads:
Dirty tricks will be used, false flags deployed to lay blame on the innocent, false protest groups will be created to attract well intended fools, and division and discord will be sown wherever possible. And where those techniques fail, the oligarchy’s true colors will be forced out of the shadows and the face of evil which despises the light of truth will continuously be forced into the spotlight.
In general, Unlimited Hangout tends to favor right in story selection and editorial positions. They also promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience and have made false claims.
