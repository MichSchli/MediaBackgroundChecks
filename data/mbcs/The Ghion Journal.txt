Analysis / Bias
In review, The Ghion Journal produces original journalistic content through its writers. Story selection often favors the far left, such as this:
[To Adapt to the Escalating Climate Crisis, Mere Reform Will Not Be Enough](https://ghionjournal.com/to-adapt-to-the-escalating-climate-crisis-mere-reform-will-not-be-enough/). In this piece, the author states, “Our goal should be not to reform capitalism, but to overthrow the capitalist centers of government and replace them with ecosocialist power structures.”
Further, this story is properly sourced to credible media outlets. In reviewing the theme of the website, one prominent theme that keeps jumping out is anti-capitalism, such as this:
[Dear Destiny…Capitalism Can’t Be Reformed](https://ghionjournal.com/dear-destiny-capitalism-cant-be-reformed/). The author of this piece is Leslie, whose bio reads “a radical leftist political commentator interested in exposing the contradictory ideological and material underpinnings of capitalism. She believes in politics that are built around the sustainable future we seek.” When it comes to sourcing information, some stories are appropriately sourced, and others [not at all](https://ghionjournal.com/obamacare-obamas-scam/). However, much of the content is opinion-based.
Editorially, The Ghion Journal rails against both
[Democrats](https://ghionjournal.com/leftists-would-do-well-to-abandon-the-democratic-party-once-and-for-all/) and Republicans as being a part of the Corporatocracy. In general, the website most closely aligns with the Marxist Socialist Left, [arguing](https://ghionjournal.com/liberate-ourselves-from-capitalism/) that capitalism is not sustainable.
