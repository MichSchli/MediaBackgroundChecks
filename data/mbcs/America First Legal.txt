History
Founded in 2021 by Stephen Miller, a former Senior Advisor to President Trump,
[America First Legal (AFL)](https://aflegal.org/senior-trump-officials-launch-america-first-legal-foundation/) is a conservative legal organization headquartered in Washington, DC. It’s known for its litigation against policies perceived as liberal or harmful to traditional values.
Associated with former
[Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) administration officials, AFL operates as a nonprofit and engages in advocacy and public messaging through its website and social media. However, AFL has faced criticism for potential bias, lack of transparency, and concerns about the factual accuracy of their claims.
Criticism includes accusations of promoting
[unfounded claims](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/11/factchecking-ads-claims-of-anti-white-bigotry/) and conspiracy theories. For instance, AFL filed a civil rights complaint against Starbucks, alleging “maintaining the “racist” programs created in 2020 and earlier this year” based on Starbucks’ [diversity](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/starbucks-diversity-programs-targeted-by-former-trump-aides-legal-group-2022-10-18/) initiatives. Additionally, they have contested educational and federal agency programs, arguing these exclude or discriminate against [white men](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/stephen-millers-anti-affirmative-group-sues-nyu-over-law-review). AFL is also active in lawsuits related to [critical race theory,](https://lamborn.house.gov/media/in-the-news/america-first-legal-pursuing-lawsuit-against-critical-race-theory-stephen-miller) seeking to stop such training in federal agencies.

Analysis / Bias
America First Legal (AFL) positions itself as a counterforce against what it perceives as the
[“radical left,”](https://aflegal.org/about/) focusing on issues like transgender rights, diversity hiring, immigration, and supporting Trump in legal battles.
In their investigation page titled
[“Biden Family Corruption Exposed,”](https://aflegal.org/biden/) AFL focuses on allegations of corruption involving [President Joe Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and his family. The language used on this page is highly emotive, with a strong emphasis on terms such as “corruption,” “scandal,” and “cover-up.” This framing suggests a pre-determined conclusion rather than a neutral presentation of facts. This page primarily targets Hunter Biden’s business activities and Joe Biden’s supposed involvement, often excluding counterarguments or contradictory evidence. Particularly, it mentions Hunter Biden’s connection with Burisma Holdings without adequately considering the absence of direct evidence implicating Joe Biden in any wrongdoing. This approach indicates a presentation of selective information lacking in comprehensive context or critical analysis.
Regarding sourcing, America First Legal typically uses
[press releases](https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-launches-new-investigation-into-joe-bidens-use-of-private-email-accounts-for-official-business-while-serving-as-vice-president/), news articles from outlets like the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) and the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), and their own legal filings (e.g., [“NARA-2022-0121-F”](https://aflegal.org/case/nara-2022-0121-f/)). It frequently cites conservative media, including the [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/) and [Fox Business](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-business/). Additionally, America First Legal has been linked to promoting conspiracy theories. This includes their stance on COVID-19 treatments, advocating for the effectiveness of [Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine](https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-sues-hhs-and-fda-for-illegally-concealing-documents-on-government-suppression-of-hydroxychloroquine-and-ivermectin-to-treat-covid-19/) against the virus. However, mainstream scientific consensus and health authorities do not support these claims and often label them unfounded or misinterpreted. Additionally, the organization is associated with promoting theories like the [great replacement theory](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/14/779208233/stephen-miller-and-white-nationalism), although this is more directly related to the site’s founder than the organization itself.
In general, AFL holds strong right biases and sometimes relies on conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and misinformation to advance pro-MAGA conservative propaganda.
