Editorially, the Grundy Register reasonably represents both sides. A review of op-eds demonstrates a reasonably low bias; however, slightly more op-eds favor the right. While more op-eds favor the right, liberal perspectives have fair representation; therefore, they earn a least biased rating on the right side of the scale. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
