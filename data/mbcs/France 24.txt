The stated mission of the three channels is to “provide global public service and a common editorial stance.” [Read our profile on France’s Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-media-profile/)

Besides government funding, they also generate revenue through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the site covers global and national news mostly through its television programming. News is often published with minimal bias in wording:
[Yemen govt strikes power-sharing deal with southern separatists](https://www.france24.com/en/20191025-yemen-govt-strikes-power-sharing-deal-with-southern-separatists). This story is properly sourced to the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). French news is also minimally biased: [Is the French tuition fees ruling a victory for foreign students?](https://www.france24.com/en/20191013-french-tuition-fees-ruling-a-victory-for-foreign-students-1)
For the most part, France 24 does not interject opinions into stories and sticks to the facts. In fact, they do not have an op-ed page. Story selection very slightly favors the left, such as this:
[UK PM Johnson sends conflicting messages to EU on Brexit delay request](https://www.france24.com/en/20191020-uk-pm-johnson-sends-conflicting-messages-to-eu-on-brexit-delay-request). In general, France24 is a low-biased straightforward news reporting agency that is factual and sourced.
