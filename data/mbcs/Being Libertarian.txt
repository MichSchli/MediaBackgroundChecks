History
Founded in 2015, Being Libertarian is a news, opinion, and information website that focuses on Libertarianism. According to their
[about page](https://beinglibertarian.com/about/), the “website acts as a point of convergence for minarchists, classical liberals, anarchists, independents, Objectivists, capitalists, and right/left-leaning libertarians.” They further state, “The goal of the group is to provide a neutral-as-can-be platform for individuals who believe in any of the various, broadly-libertarian schools of thought. As such, Being Libertarian LLC does not endorse any specific set of policies, political parties or candidates, nor any particular libertarian doctrine — other than a broad commitment to libertarian ideas.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Being Libertarian reports news and information from many different libertarian perspectives. There is sometimes the use of minimally loaded language such as this adequately sourced article:
[House Passes Federal Minimum Wage Increase – Eccentric Economics](https://beinglibertarian.com/house-passes-federal-minimum-wage-increase-eccentric-economics/). On the other hand, some op-eds contain moderately loaded language: [The Last Acceptable Bigotry: Hatred of Non-Voters – Opting Out](https://beinglibertarian.com/the-last-acceptable-bigotry-hatred-of-non-voters-opting-out/). Under the “News” tab Being Libertarian frequently reports on the positives of free-market capitalism and the more liberal social aspects of personal liberty such as this: [Far Out: Denver Decriminalizes Psychedelic Mushrooms](https://beinglibertarian.com/denver-decriminalizes-mushrooms/).
Editorially, Being Libertarian frequently reports negatively on
[socialism](https://beinglibertarian.com/self-proclaimed-socialists-have-no-idea-what-socialism-is-eccentric-economics/) and the Trump administration’s economic policies and [constitutional issues](https://beinglibertarian.com/libel-laws-trump-dangerous-ground/). When it comes to science, they present some diverse opinions on [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); however, some are questionable as it relates to the consensus: [Climate Alarmists are the Real Science Deniers – The Lowdown on Liberty](https://beinglibertarian.com/climate-alarmists-are-the-real-science-deniers-the-lowdown-on-liberty/). Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they promoted false or misleading information, as seen below in failed fact checks.
