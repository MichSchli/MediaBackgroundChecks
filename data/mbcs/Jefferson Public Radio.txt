Analysis / Bias
In review, the Jefferson Public Radio website reports news and radio programming information with a slight liberal bias. News on the website is derived from
[NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and often utilizes minimally loaded language, such as this [Are major changes coming to Californiansâ€™ electric bills? 6 things to know](https://www.ijpr.org/environment-energy-and-transportation/2023-07-23/are-major-changes-coming-to-californians-electric-bills-6-things-to-know). This story is fact-based and, like all others reviewed, relies on credible sources of information. The website also publishes content from [American Public Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-public-media/) and the [Corporation for Public Broadcasting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/).
In general, story selection tends to lean slightly left, as does editorial content, such as this
[What It Will Take To Bring Climate Justice With Climate Change](https://www.ijpr.org/show/the-jefferson-exchange/2020-08-19/thu-9-am-what-it-will-take-to-bring-climate-justice-with-climate-change). Finally, news reporting is fact-based and leans left from an editorial perspective.
