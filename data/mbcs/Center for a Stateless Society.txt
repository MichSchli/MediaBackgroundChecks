History
The Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS) is a left-anarchist think-tank and media center. Its
[mission](https://c4ss.org/about) is to explain and defend the idea of vibrant social cooperation without aggression, oppression, or centralized authority. They describe themselves as a Left-Market Think Tank and Media Center.
According to their
[about page](https://c4ss.org/about), they state their mission as “to enlarge public understanding and transform public perceptions of anarchism, while reshaping academic and movement debate, through the production and distribution of market anarchist media content, both scholarly and popular, the organization of events, and the development of networks and communities, and to serve, along with the [Alliance of the Libertarian Left](http://libertarianleft.org/) and the [Molinari Institute](http://praxeology.net/molinari.htm), as an institutional home for left market anarchists.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Center for a Stateless Society advocates for
[Left-wing market anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_market_anarchism), also known as free-market anti-capitalism and free-market socialism, and is a form of individualist anarchism and libertarian socialism. Confused yet?
In a nutshell, Left-wing market anarchists support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, and pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and socially liberal views regarding cultural issues such as gender, sexuality, and race. They also hold more collectivist views of land ownership or business ownership, hence the pro-labor label.
The C4SS publishes news under its commentary tag. The reporting here is mostly opinion-based and uses moderately loaded language such as this:
[Trumpism Reveals the Danger of Fusionism](https://c4ss.org/content/52219). This story is properly sourced from various sources, including [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/) and [Reason](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/). Although C4SS has a very negative view of Trump and the GOP, they also do not support the progressive left because they are capitalists: [No, Bernie Will Not Save Us](https://c4ss.org/content/51727). In other words, the Progressive Democrats are not left enough.
