Analysis / Bias
In review, Pew Research is primarily a polling and survey outlet that utilizes and publishes its methodology. Unlike many other polling companies that exclusively cover politics and elections, Pew covers a wide range of topics such as
[Science](http://www.pewresearch.org/science/), [Technology](http://www.pewinternet.org/), and [Religion](http://www.pewforum.org/). Pew never uses loaded language in their headlines, and articles like this: [Eastern and Western Europeans Differ on Importance of Religion, Views of Minorities, and Key Social Issues](http://www.pewforum.org/2018/10/29/eastern-and-western-europeans-differ-on-importance-of-religion-views-of-minorities-and-key-social-issues/). Further, all information is sourced in detail, with the methodology explained for each survey.
Editorially, there is little to no bias. Pew earns a Very-High factual rating because they conduct polls with strong methodology and does not manipulate content. This does not mean the poll can’t be off or wrong. It can as polling is not always accurate.
