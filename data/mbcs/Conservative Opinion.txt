[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ConservativeOpinioncom-411606772641925/about/?ref=page_internal) describes itself as “ConservativeOpinion.com is the preeminent conservative blog, featuring essays from leading conservative thinkers.” The articles reviewed today were all published under the editor-in-chief, Jordan B. Rickards. A search shows that he may be an attorney from New Jersey; however, we cannot confirm this and do not want to link the wrong person to this website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, ConservativeOpinion.com’s primary focus is on libertarianism and capitalism. There is the substantial use of loaded language in headlines when describing liberals or liberal policies such as these:
[The Blithe Ignorance of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Shows Why Socialism Appeals to Millennials](https://conservativeopinion.com/opinion/the-blithe-ignorance-of-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-shows-why-socialism-appeals-to-millennials/) and [Democrats Seek Votes From Convicts, Children, Non-Americans, and Lazy People](https://conservativeopinion.com/opinion/liberals/democrats-seek-votes-from-convicts-children-non-americans-and-lazy-people/). When it comes to sourcing information, ConservativeOpinion is hit or miss. Some articles are thoroughly sourced to credible media outlets, and others are not sourced at all. Occasionally, they link to a Questionable source such as [CNSNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/). Due to holding libertarian (free-market) leanings, they were sometimes [critical of President Donald Trump](https://conservativeopinion.com/opinion/economics/trumps-tariffs-will-reduce-trade-deficits-by-reducing-trade/).
In 2022, they continue to promote conservative libertarian-based news and opinions such as
[The Left Suffers from Abortion Distortion Syndrome](https://conservativeopinion.com/opinion/the-left-suffers-from-abortion-distortion-syndrome/). This story is sourced adequately from [MarketWatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/marketwatch/) and the Catholic News Agency. We also searched for stories on election fraud conspiracies and covid vaccines misinformation and found none. In general, ConservativeOpinion.com holds a conservative biased editorial perspective and does not always source properly.
