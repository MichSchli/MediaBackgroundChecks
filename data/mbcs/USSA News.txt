History
USSA News is a news and opinion website established in 2010 in response to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA-Obamacare). The tagline for this website is “The Tea Party’s Front Page,” which indicates a right-wing/pseudo-libertarian position. USSA News has an about page that describes its mission. This
[about page](http://ussanews.com/News1/about-ussanews-com/) also lists facts such as a 20 trillion dollar debt to prove how inefficient and wasteful the government is. Further, the about page contains an entirely false, so-called fact that reads, “Illegal aliens have more rights than most citizens.” This is [false](https://www.countable.us/articles/1022-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants). In this updated review they have changed the wording to read “Illegal aliens have espoused rights they are not entitled to.”
Finally, this site does not list any names associated with it, thereby completely lacking transparency.

Analysis / Bias
In review, USSA News uses moderately loaded language in headlines and articles:
[Russia Warns of Global Conflict over Nuclear Pact Collapse](https://ussanews.com/News1/2018/12/22/russia-warns-of-global-conflict-over-nuclear-pact-collapse/) and highly emotional wording such as this [‘Pspin’ Psaki Dodges Post Report on Crackhead Hunter Biden Business Partner’s 19 White House Visits](https://ussanews.com/2022/04/25/psaki-dodges-post-report-on-hunter-biden-business-partners-19-white-house-visits/). Sometimes they source their information well, but it is often from other right-wing sites with a mixed factual track record. For example, they use the [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/) and [Christian Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-post/) as sources of information. Both of these sources have Mixed factual ratings by our standards.
They also sometimes link to questionable sources such as
[Conservative Fighters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-fighters/), or known [purveyors of misinformation](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=lindell) such as [Mike Lindell,](https://ussanews.com/2022/04/20/critical-mike-lindell-bombshell/) which has a poor track record with fact-checkers. Lastly, all articles on this website favor the right and/or libertarian positions.
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, USSA News published misinformation related to the disease and
[vaccines](https://ussanews.com/2022/04/24/covid-fake-vaccines-increase-risk-of-severe-heart-inflammation-up-to-120-fold-major-study-finds/), such as this [COVID 19 Is Definitely Man-Made: A Timeline of Bio-Terror](https://ussanews.com/2022/04/20/covid-19-is-definitely-man-made-a-timeline-of-bio-terror/). There is no conclusive evidence that [Covid-19](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/03/26/genomic-research-points-to-natural-origin-of-covid-19/) is man-made, much less a bioweapon. Furthermore, after the election of 2020, they frequently promoted [stolen election conspiracy theories](https://ussanews.com/?s=stole+election), which have routinely been [debunked](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118). In general, USSA News promotes right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories to advance its political agenda.
