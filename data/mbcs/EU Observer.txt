The EUobserver is
[published](https://www.boell.de/index.php/en/navigation/europa-nordamerika-3312.html) by EUobserver.com ASBL, in cooperation with the Group for a [Europe of Democracies and Diversities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_of_Democracies_and_Diversities) (Eurosceptic political group that in 2004 was renamed Independence/Democracy – IND/DEM).

Analysis / Bias
Lisbeth Kirk, founder of EUobserver is the
[wife of Jens-Peter Bonde](https://www.politico.eu/article/profile-man-of-contradictions-jens-peter-bonde/), a former Danish MEP who was [Co-Chair and Chair](https://archives.eui.eu/en/isaar/687) of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities as well as for the [Independence/Democracy Group](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20060331STO06904+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN). These are Eurosceptic political groups in the European Parliament that lean right. Between 2004 and 2009, Independence/Democracy [(IND/DEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence/Democracy) was chaired by Nigel Farage (right-wing populist British politician), and until 2014 it was called Europe of Freedom and Democracy. In 2019, it became Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy and again was chaired by Nigel Farage.
In review, EUobserver publishes articles using headlines with emotionally loaded language and a Eurosceptic tone, such as
[“Euroscepticism: The EU’s new normal”](https://euobserver.com/opinion/133747) and [“EU: China, Russia responsible for Covid-19 disinformation”.](https://euobserver.com/eu-china/148618) When it comes to sourcing, the EUobserver utilizes their own correspondents, and they source through quotations from credible news outlets such as [Deutsche Welle](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/) (Center-Left Germany), [Die Welt ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/die-welt/)(Center-Right Germany), [ Le Figaro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/le-figaro-bias/) (Center-Right France), and Süddeutsche Zeitung (Center-Left Germany). In covering the USA, they are critical of the former Trump administration [“Trump’s ‘plan’ for Israel will go against EU values](https://euobserver.com/opinion/147259).”
Editorially, the EUobserver holds left-leaning views regarding immigration, such as this
[Europe’s migration system is broken: Renew has a plan](https://euobserver.com/opinion/147127). This article supports the plans of a group called [Renew Europe](https://reneweuropegroup.eu/en/about-us/), which holds left-centrist views regarding immigration. They state, “By building sustainable partnerships with third countries, we can ensure dignified shelter and reception facilities for refugees close to the home they had to flee.”
Further, they frequently report on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) as being a significant issue for Europe, [Use 25% of budget on climate change, urge EU states](https://euobserver.com/environment/144845), and they support the Paris Climate Change Agreement, as well as having an entire section dedicated to the [environment and climate](https://euobserver.com/environment). In general, they report news factually and use various left-leaning and right-leaning sources; however, editorially, they promote liberal positions on most issues.
