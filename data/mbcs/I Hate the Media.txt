History
[Founded in 2006](http://whois.domaintools.com/ihatethemedia.com), I Hate the Media is a [blog](https://www.ihatethemedia.com/faq) that publishes news “to point out all the bias and the blindness. All the lies and the lunacy. All the fakes and the phonies. All the morons and the myopic.” There is a staff page provided that lists names of contributors, but not really any biographical information. An editor is not listed.

Analysis / Bias
In review, I Hate the Media publishes very little original content but rather is more of a news curation service. A typical post on the blog consists of a link to another source with a biased opinion attached to it, such as this:
[Homeless vet, couple allegedly made up story for GoFundMe scam](https://nypost.com/2018/11/15/homeless-vet-couple-at-center-of-gofundme-controversy-allegedly-made-up-story-report/). “Remember folks, if it sounds too good to be good it may be a ripoff. Oh, and what is it about people with Bobbitt for a last name?”
While I Hate the Media links to a variety of mostly right and some left leaning sights the context of the message is always pro-right. Here is an example of extreme right wing bias that links to a known questionable source that has failed numerous fact checks:
[Trump is correct, forest mismanagement contributed to California wildfire devastation](https://personalliberty.com/trump-is-correct-forest-mismanagement-contributed-california-wildfire-devastation/). “Short version. Democrats and Greentards: “Like wow man, we just had a bong hit and got a great idea, man. Let’s just let the forests grow wild, like back to Mother Nature man.” IHTM: “Um, excuse us, but forest fires are part of Mother Nature, dummy. Have another bong hit.” Of course, their excuse is the usual suspect – global warming did it.”
When it comes to the sources they link to, many come from far-right and questionable sources, such as the
[Conservative Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-tribune/) and [Infowars.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) In general, not all content on this blog is Questionable. Many stories are 100% credible but always spun with a biased narrative before leading to the article.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years, as they do not produce original content.
