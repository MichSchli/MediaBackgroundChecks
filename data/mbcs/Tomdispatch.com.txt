Analysis / Bias
In review, TomDispatch produces high-quality journalism that often uses moderate emotional wording. Many stories focus on opposition to war, such as this
[What If, After 9/11, George W. Bush Had Thrown Parties?](https://www.tomdispatch.com/) Editorially, they align with the left through concern for climate change, equal rights, and negative reporting on conservatives and the former Trump administration, such as this [Tomgram: Rajan Menon, The Nightmare That Joe Could Inherit](https://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176766/tomgram%3A_rajan_menon%2C_the_nightmare_that_joe_could_inherit).
Regarding sourcing, they use credible sources such as
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). In general, they report factually and with a moderate left-leaning bias.
