History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/righterway.com), The Righter Way is a hyper-partisan conservative website that is written by founder Mark Webster. According to the [about page](https://righterway.com/about/) “Mark Webster is a professional writer with a focus on news and politics.” He also is “Young, gay, and first-generation American of Korean and European descent, he’s also the left’s least favorite kind of person — someone who refuses to give in to the Democrats’ identity politics agenda.” He further clarifies “Mark is the sole owner and contributor to Righter Way. Articles on the site are a mix of original content and aggregation from news sites that have released their content for republication.”
This website lacks transparency as they do not indicate where they are from.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Righter Way is a right-wing conspiracy website that does not source its stories. For example, this story
[Dems’ latest stimulus bill includes a major gift to China — one we haven’t given them for a hundred years](https://righterway.com/2020/05/13/dems-latest-stimulus-bill-includes-a-major-gift-to-china-one-we-havent-given-them-for-a-hundred-years/). This story originated from the Questionable [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/), which has failed numerous fact checks. This story is false as the bill does not mention China and simply states the Buy American Act does not have to be enacted during President proclaimed emergencies. ie. Trump or any other President can call on foreign countries for supplies.
All headlines are emotionally loaded to favor the right and denigrate the left, with most resulting in conspiracy theories such as this:
[New bombshell intelligence shows Biden LIED about Flynn unmasking — he was behind it, others included](https://righterway.com/2020/05/13/new-bombshell-intelligence-shows-biden-lied-about-flynn-unmasking-he-was-behind-it-others-included/). In general, the scope of the wording and stories makes one wonder if this is a troll site against the right. We will reserve judgment and just say the content is questionable.
- At this time, the website appears to not be publishing new content.
