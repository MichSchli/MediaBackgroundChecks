Analysis / Bias
In review, The Algemeiner Journal publishes news and analysis related to Jewish issues in the United States and around the world. They republish articles from
[Jewish News Syndicate (JNS)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jewish-news-syndicate-jns/), such as [here](https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/11/20/gulf-states-concerned-over-possible-biden-overtures-to-iran-muslim-brotherhood/). They also utilize [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) in their articles such as [“Israel Welcomes End to Convicted US Spy Pollard’s Travel Ban.”](https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/11/21/israel-welcomes-end-to-convicted-us-spy-pollards-travel-ban/) Most content is original and utilizes moderate loaded language such as this [“German Synagogue Attacked by Neo-Nazi Gunman Was Poorly Protected by Authorities, Expert Tells Trial”](https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/11/20/german-synagogue-attacked-by-neo-nazi-gunman-was-poorly-protected-by-authorities-expert-tells-trial/). For the most part, they favor right-leaning positions such as this story that is critical of a Biden Presidency [“A Biden Presidency Could Be Bad for Israel.”](https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/03/26/a-biden-presidency-could-be-bad-for-israel/) They also favor the right-leaning Netanyahu government [“Netanyahu Indictments Are Shifting Few Israeli Voters.”](https://www.algemeiner.com/2019/11/27/netanyahu-indictments-are-shifting-few-israeli-voters/) In general the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
