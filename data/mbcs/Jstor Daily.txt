Analysis / Bias
In review, JSTOR Daily publishes news and information on a wide variety of topics such as Art, Health, Education, History, Science, Technology, and Politics. The focus of this review will be on political content. JSTOR Daily sometimes utilizes loaded emotional language in headlines and articles such as this
[The Madness of John Roberts](https://daily.jstor.org/the-madness-of-john-roberts/). This story is very well sourced to such outlets as supremecourt.gov, JSTOR, [ScotusBlog](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/scotusblog/), and [oyez.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oyez-project/). When reporting on science they are pro-science and factual, promoting the consensus such as this [How 19th Century Scientists Predicted Global Warming](https://daily.jstor.org/how-19th-century-scientists-predicted-global-warming/).
Editorially, they often present views with a liberal perspective with many stories on
[Universal Healthcare](https://daily.jstor.org/americas-long-fight-over-single-payer-healthcare/), [social and racial justice](https://daily.jstor.org/the-first-black-owned-bookstore-and-the-fight-for-freedom/), [environmentalism](https://daily.jstor.org/five-ways-to-help-the-environment-while-in-lockdown/), and the promotion of LGBTQ rights such as this: [From Gay Liberation to Marriage Equality](https://daily.jstor.org/from-gay-liberation-to-marriage-equality/). Further, when reporting on conservatives and former President Trump, they often hold negative views, such as this [Border Walls are Symbols of Failure](https://daily.jstor.org/border-walls-are-symbols-of-failure/). A quote from the article reads, “President Trump has proposed an equally symbolic solution—building a bigger border wall. Interestingly, while vilifying illegal immigrants to his supporters as violent criminals, he has not penalized the industries that rely on their labor.” In general, reporting is factual and presents a left-leaning editorial bias.
