Analysis / Bias
In review, Junkee publishes articles with emotionally loaded titles, with stories typically favoring the left, such as
[“A Brief History Of Scott Morrison Flip-Flopping On His Favourite Sports Teams.”](https://junkee.com/scott-morrison-rugby-afl-teams/309077) and [“I Won’t Be Silenced”: Mehreen Faruqi On Anti-Migrant Threats After Pauline Hanson’s Tweet.” ](https://junkee.com/mehreen-faruqi-racism-pauline-hanson/341401)
Scott Morrison is the former Right Center PM of Australia.
[Faruqi](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250362) is the Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens. (Greens are a left-wing Australian political party). Junkee utilizes sources such as [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), The [Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), and [ABC News Australia.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news-australia/)
Editorially, there is a left bias in topic positions such as this
[Trans People Are Under Attack In The US, Here’s What That Means For Australia](https://junkee.com/trans-rights-us-australia/326213), and [Watch Sally Sitou Tear Apart The Coalition’s Climate Change Legacy](https://junkee.com/sally-sitou-climate-change/332850). In general, Junkee holds left-leaning editorial views and reports news mostly factually but occasionally relies on poor sources.
