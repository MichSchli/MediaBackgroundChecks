Analysis / Bias
WRAL publishes local news with minimal bias, such as this
[Update: Raleigh Police begins arrests as protests take combative turn](https://www.wral.com/update-raleigh-police-begins-arrests-as-protests-take-combative-turn/19631128/). The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) reports national and international news.
Editorially, WRAL tends to negatively report Republicans such as this
[LISA LERER: The Republican retreat on world affairs](https://www.wral.com/lisa-lerer-the-republican-retreat-on-world-affairs/19632973/). While not all editorial content favors the left, the majority does; therefore, we rate WRAL Left-Center Biased and High for factual reporting.
