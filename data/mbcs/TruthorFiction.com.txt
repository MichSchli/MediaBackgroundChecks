History
Founded in 1999, TruthOrFiction.com (also TruthOrFiction.org) is a “
[myth-busting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TruthOrFiction.com)” website about urban legends, Internet rumors, “erumors,” e-mail forwards, and other questionable pictures or stories. Unlike other similar websites, TruthOrFiction.com does not primarily provide fact-checking about current events. Instead, it often addresses wild and amazing claims, pictures, or stories that resurface cyclically. Some stories resurface every year, or every election year, while some suddenly reappear after years of dormancy.
According to their
[mission page](https://www.truthorfiction.com/about/), “Our team brings decades of award-winning journalistic experience to the public discourse, where we will debunk propaganda, disinformation, and misinformation, offer context and nuance to help you better understand where to look next, and trace the effects of so-called “fake news” around the world so you can better understand how to tell the real from the false.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
TruthOrFiction fact checks a wide range of claims from politics to urban legends, chain mails, viral memes, and anything else that may be viral. The website describes a credible methodology and rating system that displays minimal bias. Political fact checks and analysis do not use loaded wording to sway the reader, such as this
[Rasmussen: ‘Trump 2024 Would Beat Either Biden or Harris’](https://www.truthorfiction.com/rasmussen-trump-2024-would-beat-either-biden-or-harris/). This analysis determined the claim be decontextualized because it was not a political poll but a survey, which is not as accurate as polling.
We want to disclose that we frequently use TruthOrFiction as a primary source when reviewing the factual content of media sources. I have personally used them for 15 years and have found their content minimally editorialized and continuously well researched and accurate.
Failed Fact Checks
