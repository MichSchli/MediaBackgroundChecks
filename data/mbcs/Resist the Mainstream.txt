History
[Founded anonymously in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/resistthemainstream.org), Resist the Mainstream is a website that publishes conservative news and opinion stories. The website lacks transparency as they do not name an editor or state who owns them. Authors are credited but typically do not use their full or real names. According to their [about page](https://resistthemainstream.org/about/), “Resist the Mainstream is a site for people who have lost complete trust in the mainstream media. Our mission is to report the news the mainstream media won’t.”
The
[contact page](https://resistthemainstream.org/about/) claims they are from Miami, Florida; however, this is a digital virtual mailbox [forwarding service](https://www.anytimemailbox.com/s/miami-1000-brickell-avenue) that attempts to lend them credibility as an American source. According to [Stanford researchers](https://www.rferl.org/a/macedonia-fake-news-sites-us-election-conservatives/30906884.html), the website is from Veles, Macedonia, posing as an imposter conservative news source. Further, the domain for this website changes frequently to avoid being shut down.
Since 2016, Macedonians have produced numerous fake conservative websites to dupe American conservative readers and generate advertising revenue through social media sharing.

Analysis / Bias
Resist the Mainstream does not publish original news content but rather copies snippets of full articles from other sources. In some cases, they provide a crediting link to the original source, and in other cases, they violate copyrights and plagiarize. All articles reviewed favored a conservative perspective and many utilized poor sources who frequently fail checks, such as
[The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), [Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/), and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
While many of the news stories are fact-based and properly sourced, some promote
[US election fraud conspiracies](https://resistthemainstream.org/?s=election+fraud), and others promote skepticism on human-influenced climate change [Alarmist Flies Son to College on Private Jet](https://resistthemainstream.org/climate-change-alarmist-flies-son-to-college-on-private-jet/). The news published on Resist the Mainstream is usually fact-based; it is also highly partisan, favoring the right, and frequently relies on poor sources that lack credibility.
