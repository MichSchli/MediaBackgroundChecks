Analysis / Bias
In review, DiversityInc publishes a list of the top 50 companies that hire with the most diversity. This is calculated using surveys. DiversityInc provides a
[methodology](http://www.diversityinc.com/diversityinc-top-50-methodology/) page to describe how it works. Besides their top 50 list, they also publish news related to diversity, racism, and LGBTQ issues. Usually, there is minimal use of loaded language, and all information is sourced from credible media. Many times they simply republish articles from the least biased [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Promotion of diversity is considered a left-leaning position at this time and not least biased. Therefore, we rate DiversityInc Left-Center biased due to story selection that favors the left and High for factual reporting.
