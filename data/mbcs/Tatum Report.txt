History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/tatumreport.com) by former police officer Brandon Tatum, the Tatum Reports publishes news and commentary from a conservative perspective. Tatum resigned from the Tucson Police Department in October 2017 to join Liftable Media — a conservative content producer that owns and operates [The Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/). He then served as director of urban engagement for the conservative action group [Turning Point USA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/turning-point-usa/) before founding his own media company.
According to their
[about page](https://tatumreport.com/about-us/), “While largely political in nature, the site is designed to be a comprehensive news site that keeps its readers up to date on the prevailing news of the day, as well as providing specific direction about how they can make a difference.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not clearly indicate that Brandon Tatum is the owner, nor do they disclose their conservative perspective.

Analysis / Bias
The Tatum Report features original reporting based on news reporting from other sources. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded language such as this
[DeSantis Lobbies Unanimous Vote Banning Critical Race Theory](https://tatumreport.com/desantis/). This story is properly sourced to a local TV station [First Coast News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/first-coast-news/). News is broken down into categories such a politics with stories like this [Rep. Byron Donalds Will Not Stand For CNN’s Nonesense](https://tatumreport.com/rep-byron-donalds-will-not-stand-cnns-nonesense/). Another category is [law enforcement](https://tatumreport.com/category/headlines/police/), which reports on police actions often in a favorable light. Finally, the website also republishes news from the Questionable Right Biased [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and sometimes denigrates the left. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Tatum Report focused on anti-lock down measures such as this
[Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis: ‘We Are An Oasis of Freedom… In A Country Under The Yoke Of Oppressive Lockdowns’.](https://tatumreport.com/florida-gov-ron-desantis-oasis-freedom-country-yoke-oppressive-lockdowns/) When reporting on the 2020 Presidential Election, they often promoted stories about [election fraud](https://tatumreport.com/?s=election+fraud) which has been debunked. In general, the Tatum Report is strongly right-biased and sometimes promotes conspiracy theories that are ultimately not true.
