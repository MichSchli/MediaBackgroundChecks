Analysis / Bias
Komsomolskaya Pravda (K.P.) is a tabloid-style publication known for its sensationalism in news coverage. Its articles often use attention-grabbing language and emotional framing, such as
[“Khan to you, and the dog”: in Bratsk, neighbors bitten by a pit bull attacked its owner with a bat.”](https://www.irk.kp.ru/daily/27561/4885848/) The headline uses attention-grabbing language and frames the story as a dramatic confrontation between neighbors and a dangerous dog. While the article reports on an actual event, it uses language and techniques commonly associated with tabloids to sensationalize the story and appeal to readers’ emotions.
In its political news, particularly regarding
[Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/interfax-ukraine-bias/), K.P. employs emotionally loaded language and generalizations to evoke emotions and support its pro-Russian narrative. For instance, an article titled [“Is Ukraine being prepared for a “historical partition”? Why Kyiv’s closest ally stabbed him in the back](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27562.5/4887164/). [Senator Tsekov: Kyiv’s stupidity will lead to the division of Ukraine”](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27562.5/4887164/) suggests that Ukraine is being prepared for a “historical partition,” heavily favoring Russia’s perspective on the Ukraine conflict while criticizing Ukrainian leadership. The article also contains factual inaccuracies and relies heavily on the opinions of a pro-Russian politician, [Senator Tsekov](http://council.gov.ru/en/structure/persons/1167/), without presenting alternative viewpoints.
In its coverage of U.S. politics, K.P. published an interview titled
[“How Trump and Biden Use Obscenities: Viktor Bout Discusses Discord in the USA.”](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27562.5/4886960/) This interview explores the use of offensive language in American politics, focusing on former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden. K.P. frames the discussion around insights from Russian businessman Viktor Bout, who draws from his 15-year prison experience in the U.S.
Another article discusses
[Tucker Carlson’s possible interview with Vladimir Putin.](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27562.5/4887100/) It suggests Americans fear this interview because it might expose the truth about the Ukraine conflict and the Biden administration’s role. The article is critical of the United States and makes several claims not supported by evidence. For example, the author claims that the Biden administration is “putting America on the brink of war” with Russia. There is no evidence to support this claim.
