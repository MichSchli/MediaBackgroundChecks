Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/taiwan), media independence in Taiwan is on hold as they claim the main threat to media freedom comes from China, which has been exerting growing economic and political pressure on the Taiwanese media. However, [freedomhouse.org](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/taiwan) indicates Taiwan’s media environment as one of the freest in Asia by 2016. Taiwan News reports international news with low bias as they use sources such as [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and maintain factual reporting and neutral words such as [The Latest: Trump says Harvey has ‘profoundly’ affected US](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3245102).
Editorially, Taiwan News affiliates with the socially liberal
[Pan Green Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Green_Coalition), which advocates for human rights, including support for gender equality, but they also advocate economic liberalism and Taiwanese national identity. Put another way, “moderate left nationalism.” Generally, news reporting is mostly factual, with a left-leaning editorial bias.
