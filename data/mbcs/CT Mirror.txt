Analysis / Bias
In review, The Connecticut Mirror primarily covers Connecticut news through the use of journalists. They also cover some national news, mainly DC politics. The CT Mirror utilizes moderately loaded language in headlines such as this:
[CT’s Democratic gubernatorial contenders aim at Trump](https://ctmirror.org/2018/08/06/cts-democratic-gubernatorial-contenders-take-aim-trump/). This article is sourced correctly to the left-leaning [Center for Reproductive Rights](https://www.reproductiverights.org/). The wording of the article is direct and neutral but favors the liberal position of pro-choice.
In another article, they demonstrate that they are opposed to former President Trump’s environmental positions and in support of the EPA:
[Connecticut is on front line of key fights with Pruitt’s EPA.](https://ctmirror.org/2018/05/25/connecticut-front-line-key-fights-pruitts-epa/) Other positions supported by the CT Mirror are improving health care leading to a [single-payer system](https://ctmirror.org/category/all-news/health-care/), and [fighting income inequality](https://ctmirror.org/2018/12/18/wealth-inequality-solutions/). The CT Mirror generally favors the progressive left on most issues and is opposed to conservative policy. However, they always present a reasonable balance and, at least partially, their opposing viewpoint.
