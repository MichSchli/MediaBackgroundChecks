History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/thebl.com), The BL is a website that publishes news and opinions that often favor the right, promotes conspiracy theories, and is connected to the Questionable [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/). According to their [about page](https://thebl.com/about-us), “At The BL (The Beauty of Life), our mission is to present to the world the most beautiful aspects of life. We focus on content that represents fundamental moral standards and values, to enlighten all who prefer to be inspired.” The website is published in English, Spanish and Vietnamese. Further, they lack transparency as they do not provide easy access to the editor or define who is in charge of the parent company.
On December 20, 2019, it was reported that Facebook took down more than 600 accounts connected to The Epoch Times.
[According](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-says-pro-trump-media-outlet-used-artificial-intelligence-create-n1105951) to an NBC News report, “The network was called ‘The BL’ and was run by Vietnamese users posing as Americans, using fake photos generated by algorithms to simulate real identities. The Epoch Media group, which pushes a variety of pro-Trump conspiracy theories, spent $9.5 million on ads to spread content through the now-suspended pages and groups.”
Both the Epoch Times and The BL are associated with
[Falun Gong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong), a banned spiritual practice in China. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The BL typically republishes or reports on news articles by other sources. Articles and headlines frequently contain loaded emotional language with central themes being anti-communist China such as this
[CCP Virus tests not required for thousands of migrants at the border under Biden’s DHS](https://thebl.com/us-news/ccp-virus-tests-not-required-for-thousands-of-migrants-at-the-border-under-bidens-dhs.html) and pro-former President Trump such as this [Half a million patriots watch Trump celebration in Florida](https://thebl.com/us-news/half-a-million-patriots-watch-trump-celebration-in-florida.html). The first story is sourced to the far-right and Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), while the second is sourced to video from the Right Side Broadcasting Network.
Editorially, The BL strongly favors the right and frequently denigrates the Chinese government. They also frequently promote misinformation and pseudoscience such as this
[‘The greatest hoax perpetrated on the public’: Renowned virologist rejects measures imposed during the pandemic](https://thebl.com/world-news/the-greatest-hoax-perpetrated-on-the-public-renowned-virologist-rejects-measures-imposed-during-the-pandemic.html), promoting [anti-mask propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/). They also promote debunked conspiracies related to [9/11](https://thebl.com/us-news/fire-did-not-destroy-world-trade-center-building-7-on-sept-11-scientific-study-reveals.html) and election fraud during the 2020 election [‘Data dump’ of 143,300 votes for Joe Biden proves election fraud happened, says President Trump](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wisconsin-vote-dump/). They generally promote conspiracy theories and misinformation with a strong right-leaning bias.
