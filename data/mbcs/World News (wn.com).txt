Analysis / Bias
In review, WN does not produce original news content but rather links to curated content such as this
[Israel’s Netanyahu, unbeaten in elections, is going on trial](https://article.wn.com/view/2020/05/23/israel_8217s_netanyahu_unbeaten_in_elections_is_going_on_tri_o/). This story comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and most other stories are derived from credible sources that range from left to right.
However, when publishing stories regarding Covid-19, they frequently rely on pseudoscience and conspiracy sources that routinely fail fact checks, such as
[The Expose](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-expose/), [Principia Scientific](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/principia-scientific-international/), and Judy Mikovits: [All Vaccines Are Poisonous! Stop Getting Shots! Unnecessary Dr. Judy Mikovits, Tells It Like It Is – Bitchute.com](https://article.wn.com/view/2023/01/05/All_Vaccines_Are_Poisonous_Stop_Getting_Shots_Unnecessary_Dr/). Other poor sources they utilize are [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) and [Bitchute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bitchute/) videos such as this [Hydroxychloroqune Works ! Don’t take that Death-Jab aka vaccine](https://article.wn.com/view/2023/01/07/hydroxychloroqune_works_don_x27t_take_that_deathjab_aka_vacc/). [According](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/claim-hydroxychloroquine-effective-early-treatment-for-covid-19-isnt-supported-by-evidence-from-clinical-trials/) to medical fact checker [Health Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-feedback/):
There are no large clinical trials supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine as an early COVID-19 treatment. Smaller clinical trials found that early treatment with HCQ didn’t provide significant benefits to patients compared to placebo.
It should be noted that they also publish fact-based information regarding Covid-19, but they do not discriminate in publishing disinformation regarding the vaccine. In general, World News (WN) demonstrates little bias; however, they sometimes rely on poor sources that fail fact checks resulting in a Questionable rating.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years; however, some of the sources they aggregate have failed fact checks.
