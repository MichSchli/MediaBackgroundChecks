History
Rapture News Network was founded by Teresa, in her own words: “is a Christian wife, mother, and grandmother residing in Honolulu, Hawaii, though she first found Jesus in 1971, it wasn’t until 2009, when she was diagnosed with lung cancer that she found Jesus again.“

Analysis / Bias
The Rapture News Network (Teresa) primarily makes extreme conspiratorial and pseudoscientific claims. For example, she claims the end of the world is coming soon, which is sourced from another far-right Christian website: “
[Pre-Tribulation Rapture, Prophecy, Signs and Warnings](https://www.rapturenewsnetwork.com/end-times-tv-prophecy-update-end-world-coming-ready/)”. They also delve into right-wing conspiracies such as [this](https://www.rapturenewsnetwork.com/catholic-kowtowing-islamic-replacement-theology-violates-bible-breaking-israel-news/). Rapture News Network routinely uses poor right-wing sources such as the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/) to promote a right-wing agenda. Lastly, this source is very [anti-Islam](https://www.rapturenewsnetwork.com/ongoing-drama-palestinian-lies/) and uses the bible as evidence.
Overall, there are few facts on this website and most posts are either conspiracy or pseudoscience related. (M. Huitsing 8/3/2017) Updated (12/5/2018)
