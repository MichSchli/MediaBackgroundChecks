Analysis / Bias
The website is essentially a portal to promote the
[Thrive movie](http://www.thrivemovement.com/the_movie). A summary of the movie reads as [follows](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2063834/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl) “An unconventional documentary that lifts the veil on what’s really going on in our world by following the money upstream – uncovering the global consolidation of power in nearly every aspect of our lives. Weaving together breakthroughs in science, consciousness, and activism, THRIVE offers real solutions, empowering us with unprecedented and bold strategies for reclaiming our lives and our future.”
The Thrive Movement also publishes new stories that do not always align with science such as this:
[THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT FROM NEW GMOS](http://www.thrivemovement.com/existential-threat-new-gmos). There is a [strong consensus](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2016/05/gmo-safety-debate-is-over/) that GMOs are safe. Further, they also [promote miracle cures for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), such as this: [CAN CANNABIS CURE CANCER?](http://www.thrivemovement.com/can-cannabis-cure-cancer.blog) While marijuana has proven effective in pain relief, stimulating appetite during Chemo, and reducing rates of glaucoma, there isn’t any evidence to support it can or may cure cancer. Further, they promote misleading information regarding [vaccinations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), such as this: [VACCINES: WHO IS RIGHT AND WHOSE RIGHT IS IT](http://www.thrivemovement.com/vaccines-who-is-right-and-whose-right-is-it.blog)?
