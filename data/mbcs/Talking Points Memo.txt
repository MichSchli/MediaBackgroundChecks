History
Talking Points Memo (or TPM) is a liberal web-based political journalism website created and run by Josh Marshall, a journalist, liberal blogger, and historian. It debuted on November 12, 2000. According to their
[about page](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/about), “Talking Points Memo (commonly known as TPM) is one of the premier digital native political news organizations in the United States – covering a broad range of politics, policy, and national news.”
In 2007, TPM won a
[Polk Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polk_Award) for its coverage of the 2006 [U.S. Attorneys scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys_controversy), becoming the only blog so far to win the award.

Analysis / Bias
In review, TPM reports on breaking stories, investigative journalism, and opinion pieces. Story selection usually favors the left and uses mild to moderate loaded language:
[Trump Claims Doctors Left Operating Rooms To Greet Him In El Paso. Hospital Says Nope.](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-hospital-el-paso-shooting) This story is essentially a summary of a [Think Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/think-progress/) article; however, it is properly sourced and factual.
In general, editorials and story selection always leans left and often are very critical of former President Trump, such as this:
[Trump Doubles Down: American Jews Who Vote Dem Are ‘Disloyal’ To Israel](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-american-jews-democrat-disloyal-israel). Again, this story is properly sourced to evidence via tweets, video, and the [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/). Further, the website offers a blog written by Josh Marshall that frequently utilizes strong loaded language that again favors the left, such as this: [Today’s Agenda: NRA Appears To Quash Trump’s Feeble Gun Control Inclination](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/prime-beta/agenda-august-20-2019).
In general, TPM reports news factually, albeit with a moderately strong liberal-progressive bias.
