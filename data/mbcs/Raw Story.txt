Analysis / Bias
Raw Story summarizes information from other sources such as this: “
[Irate customer drags salon owner 50 feet to her death after running out on manicure without paying.](https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/irate-customer-drags-salon-worker-50-feet-death-running-manicure-without-paying/)” They also publish original stories like this: [Trans activists detained in Arizona and threatened with deportation due to bureaucratic catch-22.](https://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/trans-activist-detained-in-arizona-and-threatened-with-deportation-due-to-bureaucratic-catch-22/) Raw Story consistently utilizes strong, emotionally loaded headlines such as [“Trump insists border wall will be ‘all concrete’ — except where it’s ‘see-through’: ‘Makes sense to me!’”](https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/trump-insists-border-wall-will-concrete-except-see-makes-sense/) and [“MSNBC’s Morning Joe mocks ‘confused’ Trump over shutdown boasts: ‘Voters are blaming him.’”](https://www.rawstory.com/2018/12/msnbcs-morning-joe-mocks-confused-trump-shutdown-boasts-voters-blaming/)
Regarding sourcing, they rely on credible media outlets such as the
[Washington Blade](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-blade/), [Las Vegas Review-Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/las-vegas-review-journal/), and the [St. Louis Post Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/st-louis-post-dispatch/).
Editorially, most opinion pieces favor the left and denigrate the right, such as this
[ and ](https://www.rawstory.com/republicans-smuggled-a-filthy-racist-conspiracy-theory-into-the-united-states-congress/) [. These opinion pieces are sourced properly from credible media outlets like the ](https://www.rawstory.com/kevin-mccarthy-s-face-plant-the-new-gop-speaker-may-not-be-the-negotiation-ninja-that-he-thinks-he-is/) [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/).
When it comes to science, they support the consensus on issues such as
[climate change](https://www.rawstory.com/no-debate-anymore-climate-change-makes-extreme-weather-worse-federal-scientists-say/) and [Covid-19 vaccines](https://www.rawstory.com/vaccine-fox-contributor-camp/). In general, Raw Story is left biased based on progressive-liberal editorial perspectives. They are also fact-based and correct errors when discovered.
