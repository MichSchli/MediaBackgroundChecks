History
Founded in 2004, Teaparty.org is a news and opinion website affiliated with the
[Tea Party Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement).
According to their
[about page](https://www.teaparty.org/about-us/), “The Tea Party are those who possess a strong belief in the Judeo-Christian values embedded in our great founding documents. We believe the responsibility of our beloved nation is etched upon the hearts of true Patriots from every race, religion, national origin, and walk of life, sharing a common belief in the values which made and keep our beloved nation great. This belief led to the creation of the modern-day Tea Party.” The current President of the Tea Party is Steve Eichler J.D.
President Steve Eichler is also the founder of the
[TeaParty PAC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tea-party-inc/), which [endorsed](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00692129/summary/2020) former President Trump in the 2020 election.

Analysis / Bias
Teaparty.org presents news with extreme right-wing bias through the use of loaded words and sensational headlines such as this
[Biden Regime Shuts Down Trump Administration’s Investigation Into The Origins Of The China Coronavirus](https://www.teaparty.org/biden-regime-shuts-down-trump-administrations-investigation-into-the-origins-of-the-china-coronavirus-465233/). This original story is poorly sourced to mixed factual sources such as [The Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn-bias/) and Questionable sources like the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which routinely fails fact checks. Other stories on the website are published by disreputable sources that routinely fail fact checks, such as Infowars, [Newswars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newswars/), and [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/).
Editorially, they no longer support the original Tea Party, which represented low taxes, low regulations, and a free-market economy. Now the Tea Party endorses former President Trump with sections dedicated to Pray for Trump, the Stop the Steal conspiracy, and Team Trump. Essentially, this is a cult-like source that promotes Trump without evidence. For example, during the 2020 election, they routinely published election fraud falsehoods such as this
[Bombshell: Arizona Election Results Audit Finds ‘Significant Discrepancies,’ Ballots Off By Up To 17.5%, Joe Biden ‘Likely Did Not Win’](https://www.teaparty.org/bombshell-arizona-election-results-audit-finds-significant-discrepancies-ballots-off-by-up-to-17-5-joe-biden-likely-did-not-win-464716/).
Finally, during the pandemic, they routinely published false or misleading information regarding Covid-19, such as this

This is the 100% opposite of what is happening [Covid: Biden orders investigation into virus origin as lab leak theory debated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57260009). In general, this source frequently promotes misinformation in an attempt to promote Trump.
