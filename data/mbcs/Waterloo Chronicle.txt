In review, The Waterloo Chronicle uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Where is the cheapest gas in Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge and New Hamburg today?](https://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news/where-is-the-cheapest-gas-in-waterloo-kitchener-cambridge-and-new-hamburg-today/article_6c996222-e12e-5c3d-96f2-9fa0c12d2a6e.html) National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
