History
[Founded in 2004](http://whois.domaintools.com/thehighwire.com) by [Del Matthew Bigtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Bigtree), The Highwire is the website for his internet radio program. The website publishes [alternative health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) and medical news that frequently promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
Del Bigtree, an American television and film producer and CEO of the anti-vaccination group
[Informed Consent Action Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_Consent_Action_Network), produced the film [Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaxxed:_From_Cover-Up_to_Catastrophe) based on the discredited views of [Andrew Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) on an alleged connection between [vaccines and autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/).
The website does not have an about page; however, Mr. Bigtree describes himself as follows: “Del Bigtree is one of the preeminent voices of the Vaccine Risk Awareness Movement. His career as an Emmy-winning producer of the CBS talk show The Doctors changed abruptly when he produced the documentary
[VAXXED](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), credited with igniting a revolution against Pharmaceutical Tyranny worldwide.” [Read our country media profile of the USA.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

The Highwire does not openly disclose ownership. However, it is presumed to be owned by Del Bigtree and funded through the
[Informed Consent Action Network](https://www.icandecide.org/) via donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the primary purpose of this website is to promote anti-vaccination propaganda and health misinformation. Besides Bigtree, the website also publishes articles by
[Jefferey Jaxen](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jeffereyjaxen-com/), whose writing has been featured in discredited sources such as [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [Natural News](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), [InfoWars](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [Collective-Evolution](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/collective-evolution/), [Waking Times](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-waking-times/), Om Times, and countless others.”
Recently, The Highwire has been covering the Covid-19 pandemic with articles that utilize strongly loaded wording, such as this
[BREAKING: REMDESIVIR STUDY “A SHAM](https://thehighwire.com/breaking-remdesivir-study-a-sham/).” This article links directly to a video segment of The Highwire radio program. The Highwire routinely downplays the Coronavirus and has published debunked information regarding death totals such as this: [SHOULD WE TRUST THE COVID-19 CASE COUNT](https://thehighwire.com/should-we-trust-the-covid-19-case-count/)? This story promotes the conspiracy that Doctors and hospitals are recording more Corona deaths to receive more money. While it is true that the use of ventilators costs more and that Medicare reimburses 20% more, the claim suggests that the number of COVID-19 cases being padded is not proven; rather, evidence indicates the cases are [being undercounted](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/Fact-check-Hospitals-COVID-19-payments/).
As mentioned above, the primary purpose of this website is to promote anti-vaccination propaganda. The Highwire frequently promotes the
[debunked claim](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html) that vaccines cause autism, such as [Denialists & Gatekeepers: While CDC Ignores Autism Crisis, Experts Busy ‘Debunking’ Alternative Therapies](https://thehighwire.com/denialists-gatekeepers-while-cdc-ignores-autism-crisis-experts-busy-debunking-alternative-therapies/). Further, they also promote [cures for autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-cures/), which have zero scientific evidence to support the claim, such as this: [Autism ‘could one day be treated with a probiotic pill](https://thehighwire.com/autism-could-one-day-be-treated-with-a-probiotic-pill/).’ Currently, there isn’t a known cure for Autism, and this headline is grossly misleading as probiotics cannot cure autism. However, it has improved [ gastrointestinal health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5155168/) in those with autism.
Finally, the website promotes
[anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and conspiracy theories about how big tech suppresses alternative medicine. [Is Big Tech Killing American Health](https://thehighwire.com/is-big-tech-killing-american-health/)?
