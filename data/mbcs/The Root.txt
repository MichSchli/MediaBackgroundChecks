Analysis / Bias
In review, The Root publishes news and opinion stories with a focus on the African-American perspective. Headlines and articles utilize moderately loaded words such as this:
[Bernie Sanders Takes on Unjust Cash Bail System, but Still Doesnâ€™t Make Direct Connection to Institutional Racism.](https://www.theroot.com/bernie-sanders-takes-on-unjust-cash-bail-system-but-st-1827886869) Story selection leans left with many stories on the topics of civil rights and institutional racism. The Root always sources its information from credible media sources that are typically high for factual reporting.
Editorially, most stories favor a liberal perspective.
