Analysis / Bias
In review, Reason Magazine utilizes moderately loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles such as this:
[The Winningest Losers in Trump’s Trade War](https://reason.com/archives/2018/10/18/the-winningest-losers-in-trumps-trade-wa). Although this article is clearly an opinion piece, it does not provide hyperlinked sources to support its claims. In another article on their Hit and Run Blog titled: [Trump Blames Hurricanes for Growing Budget Deficit. Entitlements Are the Real Problem](https://reason.com/blog/2018/10/17/trump-says-hurricanes-fires-to-blame-for) they utilize numerous credible hyperlinked sources to support their claims.
Editorially, Reason takes Libertarian positions such as low taxes, free markets, low regulations, and socially liberal positions such as Marijuana legalization and pro-abortion rights. Politically, Reason falls within the Right-Center category based on economic positions (right) and socially liberal positions (Left). These positions often put Reason Magazine at odds with President Trump’s agenda regarding tariffs and free trade.
Regarding low regulations, Reason Magazine
[resists taking action on climate change](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Reason_Foundation#cite_note-officers-4). Although they [do not deny climate change](https://reason.com/blog/2018/10/11/how-big-of-a-deal-is-half-of-a-degree-of) is occurring and [influenced by humans](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they minimize the impact in favor of fewer regulations.
