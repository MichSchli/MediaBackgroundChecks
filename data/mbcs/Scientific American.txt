Analysis / Bias
In review, Scientific American is a popular science magazine and website covering general science, technology, health, psychology, the environment, and history. Information is properly sourced and does not use loaded language. Scientific American covers science through the consensus on
[GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Editorially, Scientific American is not in favor of former President Trump’s climate and deregulation stances. Evidenced by this: [Scientific American slams Donald Trump’s anti-science rhetoric in a rare op-ed](https://qz.com/762754/scientific-american-slams-donald-trumps-anti-science-rhetoric-in-a-rare-op-ed/).
In general, this is a pro-science source that has remained mostly neutral in politics throughout its history; however, in 2020, they stated, “The evidence and the science show Donald Trump badly damaged the U.S. and its people—because he rejects evidence and science.” Therefore, this is a pro-science source that offers left-leaning opinions.
