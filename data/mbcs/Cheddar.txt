Analysis / Bias
In review, Cheddar covers financial news via steaming networks, video, and website articles. Website articles usually are accompanied by video and utilize minimally loaded words such as this:
[Marijuana Earnings Reveal Troubling Trend in Canadian Cannabis](https://cheddar.com/media/marijuana-earnings-reveal-troubling-trend-in-canadian-cannabis). This article is also properly sourced from Canadian media.
Regarding politics, Cheddar tends to present a negative view of former President Trump, as evidenced by this: Madeleine Albright:
[Trump Is the ‘Least Democratic President’ in Modern U.S. History](https://cheddar.com/media/albright-trump-is-the-least-democratic-president-in-modern-u-s-history) and this [Trump’s Work Ethic in Question After Private Schedules Leaked](https://cheddar.com/media/trumps-work-ethic-in-question-after-private-schedules-leaked). Cheddar also tends to [report positively](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on issues favored by the left, such as [climate change](https://cheddar.com/search?q=climate%20change).
Cheddar’s information is well-sourced and slightly favors the left in story selection and tone.
