Analysis / Bias
The Journalist’s Resource publishes original reporting on news-related research, studies and information. Articles use minimal loaded words with headlines accurately describing what the piece is about, such as this.
[These were the most-read pieces on The Journalist’s Resource in 2022](https://journalistsresource.org/home/these-were-the-most-read-pieces-on-the-journalists-resource-in-2022/). Like all reviewed articles, it is properly sourced to credible media outlets and journals.
Editorially, The Journalist Resource does not offer strong opinions within their pieces; however, the topics they choose to cover appeal slightly to the left, such as these:
[Racial disparities in mental health care: An explainer and research roundup](https://journalistsresource.org/home/racial-disparities-mental-health/) [Antisemitism on the rise: A research roundup](https://journalistsresource.org/home/antisemitism-on-the-rise-an-explainer-and-research-roundup/) [Gun buybacks: What the research says](https://journalistsresource.org/health/gun-buybacks-what-the-research-says/) [How the health care sector contributes to climate change: a research roundup and explainer](https://journalistsresource.org/home/health-care-sector-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-research/)
Generally, the reporting is fact-based and holds a slight left-leaning bias in story selection.
