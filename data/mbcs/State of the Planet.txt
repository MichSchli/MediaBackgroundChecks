Analysis / Bias
Columbia Climate School’s website, State of the Planet, offers comprehensive information on climate change and its impacts. For example, it features Columbia Law School’s
[Climate Reregulation Tracker,](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/01/20/climate-reregulation-tracker/) which documents the Biden-Harris administration’s restoration of federal climate policies after previous rollbacks. The school also publishes a variety of reports and articles on climate change. In an article titled [“How to Defeat the Climate Change Complexity Monster,”](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/05/10/how-to-defeat-the-climate-change-complexity-monster/) several scientific studies support the perspective that climate change poses a significant threat.
Another article contains emotionally loaded language titled “
[While No One Was Watching: Changing Environmental Regulations Under the Trump Administration.”](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/05/21/environmental-regulations-trump/) Notably, this article uses emotionally charged language, mainly to critique Trump’s policies. The article also critiques President Obama but uses a more critical tone for Trump’s policies. The sources mentioned in the articles above include The University of Bergen (UiB) and the scientific journal [Nature](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nature/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Brookings](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/) Institution’s deregulation tracker, and Harvard’s Environmental and Energy Law program’s Regulatory Rollback Tracker as well as Columbia Law School’s Climate Reregulation Tracker. Finally, the State of the Planet usually reports favorably on the Biden administration, such as this [Joe Biden’s Inspiring and Strategic Climate and Economic Leadership.](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/04/26/joe-bidens-inspiring-and-strategic-climate-and-economic-leadership/)
The Columbia Climate School’s website is updated regularly with new information, and its faculty are experts in their respective fields. However, despite its commitment to academic rigor in research and educational programs, it exhibits a moderate left-leaning editorial bias through advocacy for fighting climate change and environmental justice.
