Analysis / Bias
In review, IPS News uses minimally loaded words in their articles such as:
[“Former UN Chief Takes the Helm of Global Green Growth Institute”](http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/03/former-un-chief-takes-helm-global-green-growth-institute/) and [“International Solidarity” at Yemen Donor Conference.”](http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/04/international-solidarity-yemen-donor-conference/) In their reports, such as “ [How Global Emissions Have Changed Since 1850,”](http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/04/global-emissions-changed-since-1850/) they utilize these credible sources: the non-profit organization The World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Washington-based progressive think tank, [Institute for Policy Studies.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/institute-policy-studies/) Further, IPS does not have a favorable opinion of former [President Trump](http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/04/trump-begins-reverberate-mexicos-presidential-elections/). Politically, the majority of stories favor those supported by the left.
