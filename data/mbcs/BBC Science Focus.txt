Analysis / Bias
Science Focus publishes layman’s articles about science, technology, and research. Many articles have headlines that feature questions like
[Why does writing my own notes help me learn?](https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/why-does-writing-my-own-notes-help-me-learn/) The website also has a section dedicated to health and medicine with an emphasis on Covid-19 [Blood test could predict the likelihood of developing long COVID, study suggests](https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/blood-test-could-predict-the-likelihood-of-developing-long-covid-study-suggests/). Articles are properly sourced from government websites and peer-reviewed journals.
Editorially, BBC Science Focus leans left with concern for the environment and climate change, such as this
[Are we too late to stop climate change?](https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/can-we-stop-climate-change/) In general, Science Focus is a left-leaning pro-science source.
