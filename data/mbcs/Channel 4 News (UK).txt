Analysis / Bias
In review, the Channel 4 News website publishes information about their television programming and news stories within the United Kingdom and the world. Many news stories consist of video clips from their television news program. Content on the website is often well-sourced and fact-based with moderate use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Exploring N Ireland’s divides as Brexit looms](https://www.channel4.com/news/exploring-n-irelands-divides-as-brexit-looms).
Editorially, there is a moderate liberal bias with
[frequent stories](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on [climate change](https://www.channel4.com/news/climate-change-the-scale-of-the-challenge) and opposition to [Brexit](https://www.channel4.com/news/brexit-party-targets-immigration-in-election-contract). Further, they negatively report on former [U.S. President Donald Trump](https://www.channel4.com/news/the-us-cannot-rewrite-international-law-to-fit-trumps-ideology-says-former-spokeswoman-for-palestinian-pm) and conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, such as this: [DUP says Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal ‘the worst of all worlds](https://www.channel4.com/news/dup-says-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-the-worst-of-all-worlds).’
Channel 4 News also offers a
[fact-checking](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck) service that is not a part of the [IFCN](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories).
