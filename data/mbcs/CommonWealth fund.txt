Analysis / Bias
In review, The Commonwealth Fund generally promotes access to healthcare for all. There isn’t use of loaded language, and all information is properly sourced to low biased and scientific sources. There is a left-leaning bias politically as they support
[universal healthcare](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2008/feb/learning-from-taiwan--experience-with-universal-health-insurance), which is considered the policy of progressive democrats.
The Commonwealth Fund typically reports factually but disagrees with former President Trump on health care access, such as this:
[The Affordable Care Act Under the Trump Administration](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/affordable-care-act-under-trump-administration). This story is thoroughly sourced from credible media outlets. In general, the Commonwealth Fund reports factually, with a left-leaning editorial perspective.
