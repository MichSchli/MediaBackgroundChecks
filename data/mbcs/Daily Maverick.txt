The Daily Maverick also publishes critical articles of the government, such as
[“Six months after national elections, SA’s leading parties continue to disappoint.”](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-12-02-six-months-after-national-elections-sas-leading-parties-continue-to-disappoint/) A quote from the article reads, “For those who voted for the ANC in the hope that Ramaphosa would clean things up, there is very little evidence that he is succeeding. Or even trying.” The website also publishes articles critical of The [Economic Freedom Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters) (EFF) leader Julius Malema (South African far-left Pan-Africanist party), the third-largest party in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_South_Africa). For example, in this article, [” With echoes of Adolf Hitler, Julius Malema makes his move to establish an African Reich](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2019-12-18-with-echoes-of-adolf-hitler-julius-malema-makes-his-move-to-establish-an-african-reich/).” Generally, they report on politics with minimal bias in story selection and editorial positions.
