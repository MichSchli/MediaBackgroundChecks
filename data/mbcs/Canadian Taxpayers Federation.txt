Analysis / Bias
The Canadian Taxpayers Federation advocates for conservative fiscal policy. The website features a newsroom that reports news with moderately loaded emotional language, such as this
[Teachers’ compensation is the cost elephant in the room](https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/teachers%E2%80%99-compensation-is-the-cost-elephant-in-the-room). This story offers reasonable sourcing. The website also offers petitions to curb what they feel is wasteful spending, such as this [Stop Trudeau’s debt dive](https://www.taxpayer.com/petitions/stop-trudeau%E2%80%99s-debt-dive) and [No Carbon Taxes!](https://www.taxpayer.com/campaigns/No%20Carbon%20Taxes!) Finally, they have a section where they answer questions such as [Who do we owe our federal debt to?](https://www.taxpayer.com/resources/myth-busters/)
Editorially, the CTF aligns with Libertarian right as they generally advocate for free-market principles. When reviewing sources, we check on their adherence to the consensus of science. The CTF does not deny climate change, but they do not accept many government interventions
[Trudeau’s carbon tax is fake environmental policy.](https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/trudeau%E2%80%99s-carbon-tax-is-fake-environmental-policy?id=&idCat=) In general, they report factually and with a right-leaning libertarian bias.
