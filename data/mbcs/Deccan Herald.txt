Analysis / Bias
In review, they publish national stories with neutral headlines such as “
[Journalist Gauri Lankesh shot dead outside home](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/631606/journalist-gowri-lankesh-shot-dead.html).” Further, their articles are well-sourced through quotes, but they rarely provide links to those sources, which does not allow the reader to check the source’s credibility. For the USA, their news coverage mostly leans left, such as: “ [Trump’s tougher H1B rules take toll, disheartened wife commits suicide](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/609947/trumps-tougher-h1b-rules-take.html).”
