Analysis / Bias
In review, BestLife publishes articles covering fashion, lifestyle, and politics. They typically publish articles with headlines such as
[“A Disney World Employee Is Rating Celebrities Based on How Rude They Are”](https://bestlifeonline.com/disney-employee-rating-celebrities-news/) and [“20 Hard Truths About Penis Size: Everything You Need to Know About How You Measure Up.”](https://bestlifeonline.com/penis-size/) They also publish news articles such as [ “President Biden Just Predicted When Things Will Return to Normal](https://bestlifeonline.com/biden-back-normal-news/).” BestLife often sources to themselves, but they also use sources such as [CNN,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) cdc.gov, [Science Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/science-daily/), and sites like oakastrology.com.
The website also publishes listicle articles with clickbait headlines: “
[17 Facts About Men’s Bodies Women Probably Don’t Know.”](https://bestlifeonline.com/facts-mens-bodies-women-dont-know/) Further, they publish articles promoting [horoscopes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/) which are considered a pseudoscience “ [The Best Holiday Gifts for Every Zodiac Sign in 2019, According to Astrologist.”](https://bestlifeonline.com/gifts-for-every-zodiac-sign/) Although they lightly promote pseudoscience through horoscopes and use clickbait type headlines, most information supports science consensus and is minimally biased.
