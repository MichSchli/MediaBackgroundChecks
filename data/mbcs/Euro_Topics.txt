[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung](https://www.bpb.de/die-bpb/ueber-uns/auftrag/343876/70-jahre-bpb/), a federal agency of the German government, and operated by the Network for Reporting on Eastern Europe n-ost.
Analysis / Bias
Euro|Topics offers various sections, including DEBATES, DOSSIER, and MEDIA. The DEBATES section focuses on current issues, providing a platform for diverse opinions on topics ranging from geopolitical tensions, like the situation between Hamas and
[Israel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/), to political changes within European countries, such as a potential change of government in [Poland](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poland-media-profile/) and even infrastructure and security issues like the Finnish-Estonian gas pipeline.
We analyzed the
[dossier](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/4/dossier) on [the Israel-Palestine conflict](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/200433/israel-palestine-conflict), focusing specifically on the snippets provided for 22 debates on the subject. It’s important to note that Euro|Topics aggregates articles from various European newspapers, each with its own bias, usually indicated above the snippet. Clicking on the ‘Original article’ often redirects to these European newspapers, some of which are not accessible due to subscription-based models, such as an [article](https://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/monde/paix-au-proche-orient-le-cimetiere-des-illusions-20231009) from [Le Figaro.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/le-figaro-bias/)
Based solely on the available snippets, our assessment reveals a clear pro-Israel bias. For example, headlines like ‘Terror against Israel: what is the right response?’ portray Israel as the victim and subtly question the legitimacy of pro-Palestinian actions. Overall, the framing of these snippets suggests a pro-Israel leaning in the aggregated European press coverage of the conflict.
The Israel-Palestine snippet analysis is a case study to understand better how Eurotopics aggregates and presents Europe’s perspectives on various issues. Regarding Eurotopics’ overall bias, we rate the platform as minimally biased because it aggregates articles from diverse European papers, offering a broad spectrum of viewpoints. However, we also rate them as Mostly Factual regarding factual reporting, given that they include
[articles](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/308886/labour-leader-wants-a-fresh-start-for-the-uk?zitat=308867#zitat308867) from sources like the [Daily Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/), which have failed fact checks.
