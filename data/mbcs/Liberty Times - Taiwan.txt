Analysis / Bias
Liberty Times publishes original news and analysis on both local and international events. They publish about cultural events such as
[“Royal Caviar Club offers the best caviar mooncakes.”](https://art.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/4364713) They also produce political articles such as [“Biden said again that “the U.S. military will defend Taiwan.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Continue to deepen the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership.”](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/4062684) This article reports on [U.S. President Joe Biden’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/facts-and-bias-joe-biden/) statement that the U.S. would defend Taiwan if it were attacked. The newspaper quotes Biden’s interview on the “60 Minutes” program and includes Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs response to his statement. The article is factual and employs neutral language. However, it lacks a hyperlink to the source.
Editorially, they favor the pro-independence
[Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)](https://www.dpp.org.tw/). Being pro-independence means supporting Taiwan’s sovereignty as a separate entity from [China](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/). The [Reuters Institute](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2023/taiwan) reports that the Liberty Times, as a pro-independence publication, supports Taiwan’s independence from China. For example, in this editorial piece republished from the Taipei Times [The Liberty Times Editorial: Core values lead to the top job](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2023/07/15/2003803198) they openly endorse the DPP with this quote:
The DPP is no longer only a party intent on ushering in reform, but a competitive one. To find the balance between the public will and the party’s core values and push for reform and actualize one’s vision by riding on the public’s support is a lesson that an innovative party seeking to embrace the people cannot afford to forget.
In general, the Liberty Times holds a left-leaning editorial bias, and news reporting appears to be factual; however, without hyperlinks, it is difficult to verify the sources of information.
