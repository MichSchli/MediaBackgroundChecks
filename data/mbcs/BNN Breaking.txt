Analysis / Bias
In analyzing the content and journalistic practices of BNN Breaking, we reviewed several articles for their approach to reporting, use of language, and adherence to journalistic standards.
The first article,
[“Turkey’s Grand Ambitions: Key Developments and Future Plans in Transportation,”](https://bnnbreaking.com/world/turkey/turkeys-grand-ambitions-key-developments-and-future-plans-in-transportation/) by Safak Costu, focuses on infrastructure projects in Turkey. The language is primarily neutral and informative, emphasizing developments and strategic advantages. There is minimal emotionally loaded language, indicating a straightforward reporting approach. However, this article lacks direct hyperlinks to its primary source, namely the reported interview with [Anadolu Agency.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anadolu-agency/) The absence of a direct link or an appropriately captioned image to validate its source undermines BNN Breaking’s credibility and adherence to journalistic norms of source transparency.
The second article, “
[Tragic Collapse of Under-Construction Church in Telangana: One Dead, Nine Injured,”](https://bnnbreaking.com/bnn-newsroom/tragic-collapse-of-under-construction-church-in-telangana-one-dead-nine-injured/) also fails to provide direct links or clear citations to its sources. In contrast, [IndiaTV News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/india-tv/), reporting the same breaking news about the [church collapse in Telangana,](https://www.indiatvnews.com/telangana/hyderabad-church-collapse-dead-injured-under-construction-building-falls-sangareddy-rescue-operations-latest-updates-2024-01-07-910702) attributes its information to [ANI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/asian-news-international-ani/) (Asian News International). The BNN Breaking article, on the other hand, presents the story without such clear attribution, focusing more on a narrative storytelling approach.
Another article, The BNN Breaking article
[ “CCTV Exposes Corruption in China, Targets Soccer in Anti-Graft Documentary”](https://bnnbreaking.com/politics/groundbreaking-anti-corruption-documentary-hits-chinese-prime-time-television/) by Salman Khan, reports on a Chinese state broadcaster [CCTV’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cctv-america/) documentary, focusing on significant corruption cases in China, particularly in the soccer world. However, the article does not include direct hyperlinks or references to external sources.
In general, the BNN Breaking articles reviewed lack clear sourcing, which could indicate a reliance on content aggregation or AI-generated content without proper acknowledgment.
