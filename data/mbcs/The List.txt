Analysis / Bias
In review, The List generally publishes clickbait-type stories with interesting headlines such as this
[When you drink Diet Coke every day, this is what happens to your body](https://www.thelist.com/198674/when-you-drink-diet-coke-every-day-this-is-what-happens-to-your-body/). This story is reasonably sourced from [Healthline](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/healthline/) and the [Mayo Clinic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mayo-clinic/). Many stories focus on entertainment and lifestyle, such as this: [The weird reason Brandi Glanville dumped David Schwimmer](https://www.thelist.com/198911/the-weird-reason-brandi-glanville-dumped-david-schwimmer/).
Under the health tab, there are numerous articles that could be best described as not proven, but certainly not blatant pseudosciences such as this
[The truth about your root chakra](https://www.thelist.com/198501/the-truth-about-your-root-chakra/) and this [When you drink pickle juice every day, this is what happens to your body](https://www.thelist.com/193007/when-you-drink-pickle-juice-every-day-this-is-what-happens-to-your-body/). While this source does publish factual content, much is the kind you find in clickbait ads under the content of websites. When reporting on politics, they generally stick with facts and clickbait-type articles such as this: [The truth about floating hospitals](https://www.thelist.com/195541/the-truth-about-floating-hospitals/). In general, this source is hard to classify as they focus on the sensational, but more stories favor the left by a slight margin.
