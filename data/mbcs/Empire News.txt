Analysis / Bias
In review, Empire News appropriately disclaims they are satire. Typical satire stories are as follows
[Multiple People Hospitalized, Several Arrested During ‘Rush Limbaugh Has Cancer’ Celebration in Boston](https://empirenews.net/multiple-people-hospitalized-several-arrested-during-rush-limbaugh-has-cancer-celebration-in-boston/), and [Trump To Host Massive ‘I Beat Impeachment’ Party at White House This Weekend](https://empirenews.net/trump-to-host-massive-i-beat-impeachment-party-at-white-house-this-weekend/). While these two examples might indicate they only go after the right, nope, there is this: [Michelle Obama Files For Divorce After Shocking Revelation; Barack Obama Admits: ‘I’m Gay!’](https://empirenews.net/michelle-obama-files-for-divorce-after-shocking-revelation-barack-obama-admits-im-gay/).
