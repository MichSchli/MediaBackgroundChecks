History
Jesus is Savior (JIS), authored by David J. Stewart, is not a news source in the usual sense. JIS is an assortment of stories and rants of religious zealotry, a sprinkling of random conspiracy theories with a specific bias towards the Catholic Church.

Analysis / Bias
The stories are poorly sourced and researched, heavily biased in their content, and strike out at any and everyone who does not follow what appears to be Mr. Stewart’s strict interpretation of the King James Bible. With headlines such as “The Pope Is The Vicar Of Hell” and “Proof That Evolution Is A LIE!” combined with poorly sourced and heavily biased writing earns Jesus is Savior a rating of Conspiracy – Pseudoscience.
The purpose of this re-review is to see if things have changed to adjust our rating. The answer is obvious. NO! They are publishing crackpot conspiracy theories such as this
[911 WAS AN INSIDE JOB!](https://www.c-span.org/video/?320748-5/washington-journal-architects-engineers-911-truth) and this [Evolution is a Big Hoax.](http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evolution%20Hoax/evolution_the_big_hoax.htm)
In general, this is a crazy Christian Zealotry site that is downgraded to Very Low bias on this review.
