The other Gizmodo Media outlets acquired were [Deadspin](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/deadspin/), [Jezabel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jezebel/), [Kotaku](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kotaku/), [The Root](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-root/), and [Splinter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/splinter/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Gizmodo primarily reports on technology and entertainment; however, they also report on politics with a left-leaning bias in story selection. There is the use of strong loaded language in headlines:
[The Trump Administration Is Spinning Its Latest Pro-Coal Policy as Good for People of Color](https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-trump-administration-is-spinning-its-latest-pro-coa-1830917422). This story is properly sourced to the EPA and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). In another story, they denigrate the right, such as this: [Trump Invites Consortium of Conservative Internet Trolls to The White House for ‘Social Media Summit](https://gizmodo.com/trump-invites-consortium-of-conservative-internet-troll-1836058173).’ Editorially, Gizmodo does not separate news from opinion, which can be misleading, with most editorial positions favoring the left.
