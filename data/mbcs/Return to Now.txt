History
[Founded in 2016](http://whois.domaintools.com/returntonow.net), Return to Now is a blog that reports news on natural health and medicine. According to their [about page](https://returntonow.net/about/): “Return to Now is dedicated to helping humans live fully in the present while gleaning tips on how to do so from our distant past. It’s a new kind of “news” website, whose contributors are not as concerned with current events as we are with the whole of the human experience.” The website does not list an editor or owner, although Sara Burrows is listed as the author of most information on this website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Return to Now publishes/republishes news stories related to natural health. Some of the articles published on this blog are sourced properly to credible scientific journals or though factual mainstream media sources. However, in between these articles, there is anti-vaccination propaganda such as this:
[7 Reasons Vaccinating Your Child Could Be the Worst Mistake You Ever Make](https://returntonow.net/2016/03/31/vaccine-myths/) or [BREAKING: Baby Foreskins Secretly Sold to Vaccine Companies For Decades, Foreskin Cells Now Injected Back into Babies](https://returntonow.net/2017/10/05/baby-foreskins-sold-vaccine-companies-injected-back-babies/). The first article sources [The Weston A. Price Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston_A._Price_Foundation), which [Science Based Medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/science-based-medicine/) has described as “ [one of the worst on the internet](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/sbm-weston-prices-appalling-legacy/).” The second article comes from VacTruth, which openly promotes [anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/).
Predictably, Return to Now also does not have a favorable opinion of
[GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/): [How GMO Corn Could Be Contributing to the “Leaky Gut” Epidemic.](https://returntonow.net/2016/03/10/526/) This piece sources the author of [Seeds of Deception,](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0972966587/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0972966587&linkCode=as2&tag=returntonow-20&linkId=EHHB64I54BN5WSFS) Jeffrey Smith, and has been challenged by the [Celiac Disease Foundation](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2013/12/03/Celiac-Disease-Foundation-plant-geneticist-challenge-report-linking-GMOs-to-celiac-disease-gluten-sensitivity#.Up93r8RDv-t).
