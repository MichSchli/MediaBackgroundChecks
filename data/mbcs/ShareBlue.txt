Analysis / Bias
In review, Shareblue is a news and opinion website that always favors the left. There is significant use of loaded language in headlines such as this
[Top budget official warns Trump is a ‘drag’ on the economy](https://shareblue.com/top-budget-official-cbo-warns-trump-drag-on-economy/) and this [GOP begs Congress to ‘move on’ from the Trump crimes Mueller found](https://shareblue.com/gop-begs-congress-move-on-trump-crimes/). This latter story comes directly republished from the [American Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-independent-institute/), which we rate as a left-biased source. Most stories on this website come from other sources and are not original content. In fact, almost all are republications from the American Independent. In general, story selection 100% favors the left, and sometimes poor sources are used.
