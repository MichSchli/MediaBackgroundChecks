Analysis / Bias
In review, CS Globe covers news related to pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
[For example](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), [Here’s 100% Proof that Chemtrails are Real](http://csglobe.com/heres-100-proof-that-chemtrails-are-real/). They also [promote cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) such as this: [There Are Now 100 Scientific Studies Proving Cannabis Cures Cancer](http://csglobe.com/scientific-studies-cannabis-cures-cancer/). While we are certain Cannabis can aid in cancer treatment for logical scientific reasons, to say it cures it, is a stretch. We will not spend much time on this source. If we are wrong please provide evidence and we will adjust accordingly.
