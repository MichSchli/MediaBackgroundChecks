Analysis / Bias
In review, the Lebanon Daily News covers local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[NTSB investigators begin probe into Pa. Turnpike crash](https://www.ldnews.com/videos/news/2020/01/09/ntsb-investigators-begin-probe-into-pa-turnpike-crash/4419741002/). Many stories have accompanying videos or images. National and International news is delivered through the [USA Today Network](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/).
Editorially, the Lebanon Daily News endorsed Republican candidates in the past, such as George W. Bush in 2004; however, in 2008, they endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama. Editorial columns offer both right and left-leaning perspectives, such as these:
[Column: Democratsâ€™ worst day ever](https://www.ldnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/03/08/column-democrats-worst-day-ever/98904644/) and [10 good things Trump brought us](https://www.ldnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/11/18/10-good-things-trump-brought-us/94034526/) (this editorial is harshly critical of former President Trump). In general, the Lebanon Daily News reports news factually and presents editorial positions with a reasonable political bias.
