Analysis / Bias
In review, Digital Journal uses citizen journalists for news reporting and Op-Eds. All articles reviewed were well-sourced and used minimally loaded language such as this
[Australia will not send officials to Beijing Olympics: PM](https://www.digitaljournal.com/sports/australia-will-not-send-officials-to-beijing-olympics-pm/article). Digital Journal also aggregates news from the least biased [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), such as the one listed.
Editorially, op-eds are clearly labeled and usually favor the left, such as this
[Op-Ed: Trump gets his wish — A political Civil War is brewing in Georgia.](https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/op-ed-trump-gets-his-wish-a-political-civil-war-is-brewing-in-georgia/article) In general, they republish the least biased AFP and minimize editorials.
