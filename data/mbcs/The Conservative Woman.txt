Analysis / Bias
In review, The Conservative Woman utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“Why do state and BBC ignore mass child rape culture? Because they can’t handle the truth.”](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-do-state-and-bbc-ignore-mass-child-rape-culture-because-they-cant-handle-the-truth/) This article is also poorly sourced; however, [occasionally](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/rapists-racists-hellholes-take-news/), they utilize credible right-leaning sources such as [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/) and questionable sources such as the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/). Regarding US politics, The Conservative Woman’s word choices are pro-Trump. For example, here is a quote from an [article:](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/seven-great-conservative-speeches-7-donald-trump/) “Donald Trump does not have a natural way with words like Ronald Reagan. He is not an ideologue like Margaret Thatcher. He does not have the intellect or the prodigious grasp of history that Churchill had. Yet in the last year, he has delivered the two most significant conservative speeches of this century.”
On national politics, the
[editorial opinion](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/theresa-may-leader-cant-lead-must-go/) of The Conservative Woman is against Theresa May, as seen from this quote from an article that reads, “One inescapable factor is common to all of these. It is Theresa May’s own near-total lack of ideology, intellectual curiosity, governing-philosophy, vision, direction, commitment, strategy, competence, charisma, and, most of all, leadership ability.” Further, they also have strong [anti-immigrant (Muslims)](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/radicalisation-and-child-rape-the-no-go-areas-in-liberal-elites-community-agenda/) and [anti-abortion](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-the-irish-were-manipulated-into-voting-for-abortion/) sentiments.
The Conservative Woman is also an anti-
[Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)) since they view them as not conservative enough. For example, in this editorial regarding the conservative Tory Party: [“Laura Perrins: The Tories are the enemy within](https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/laura-perrins-tories-enemy-within/),” Ms. Perrins states her own “Deep State” conspiracy theories “foreign Presidents, and Prime Ministers, the military, the intelligence services, the police, the charities, the stars, celebrities and virtue signallers, the universities and the crooked academics – almost the entire financial, political, media, military/industrial, intelligence agency, cultural, academic are all elements of this hybrid state, the Deep State.”
In 2020, The Conservative Woman published misleading information regarding the Corona Virus, such as this
[Malaria drug and zinc, the missing link.](https://conservativewoman.co.uk/malaria-drug-and-zinc-the-missing-link/) At this time, there isn’t evidence that [hydroxychloroquine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52779309) is an effective treatment for Coronavirus.
