History
Founded in 2014, Vision Times is a conservative news and opinion website affiliated with Falun Gong and the Epoch Times Media Group.
[The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), founded by [John Tang](http://www.epochmediagroup.com/) and a group of Chinese-American’s are also [Falun Gong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times) practitioners. Falun Gong, a Chinese spiritual philosophy, has been suppressed by the Chinese government. The Epoch Times and Vision Times hold strong anti-Chinese government sentiments.
On December 20, 2019, Facebook took down more than 600 accounts connected to The Epoch Times.
[According](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-says-pro-trump-media-outlet-used-artificial-intelligence-create-n1105951) to an NBC News report, “The network was called ‘The BL’ and was run by Vietnamese users posing as Americans, using fake photos generated by algorithms to simulate real identities. The Epoch Media group, which pushes a variety of pro-Trump conspiracy theories, spent $9.5 million on ads to spread content through the now-suspended pages and groups.” [According to a 2021](https://www-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/technology/epoch-media-right-wing-disinformation.amp.html) [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) report, Vision Times is among a dozen websites connected to the Epoch Media group that spreads misleading information.

Analysis / Bias
The Vision Times reports news and opinion in the following sections: China, US, World, Taiwan, Lifestyle, Health, Travel, and Science. They also cover politics and lifestyle.
According to an article in the
[Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), they [describe](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/inside-the-epoch-times-a-mysterious-pro-trump-newspaper/617645/) the Vision Times as a “doppelganger” of The Epoch Times.
The Vision Times covers straight news reporting through journalists and low-biased syndication through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). However, when writing on China, they reflect a strong anti-Chinese government bias such as this [Communist China Attempts to Bolster Its Olympic Medal Count by Including Medals Won by Hong Kong and Taiwan](https://www.visiontimes.com/2021/08/17/communist-china-attempts-to-bolster-its-olympic-medal-count-by-including-medals-won-by-hong-kong-and-taiwan.html). The Vision Times also uses loaded language that favors the right, such as [Biden’s Export-Import Bank Nominee Has Concerning Conflicts of Interest With Chinese Influence Organizations](https://www.visiontimes.com/2021/09/16/export-import-bank-reta-jo-lewis-china-influence.html).
Editorially, the Vision Times favors former President Trump by often reporting favorably such as this

Further, they report more negatively on Democrats, such as this [General Milley’s Secret Calls to China, Miller Dismisses Involvement](https://www.visiontimes.com/2021/09/29/general-milleys-secret-calls-to-china-miller-dismisses-involvement.html).
During the 2020-2021 Coronavirus outbreak, they have promoted misinformation such as this
[5 Things to Know Before Getting a Coronavirus Vaccine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210315205320/https://visiontimes.com/2021/02/07/five-things-to-know-before-getting-a-coronavirus-vaccine.html). In this article, they claim that the vaccines were only tested on healthy adults. [This is not true](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/31/facebook-posts/covid-19-vaccine-testing-included-people-underlyin/) as “Thousands of people with underlying health conditions were included in testing before COVID-19 vaccines were given authorization in the U.S.” In general, most news is reported factually; however, it is consistently one-sided in opposition to China and sometimes promotes misleading information. A complete lack of transparency, therefore, renders this source questionable.
