Analysis / Bias
In review, iNews reports news with minimal bias using credible media sources such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [NYT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). However, they do use the left-leaning loaded language both in their headlines and articles when discussing social issues and inequality, such as “ [Race audit reveals ‘bleak picture’ of inequality in British society](https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/politics/race-audit-reveals-bleak-picture-inequality-british-society/).” iNews also has a [left-center position editorially](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/editor/unhappy-boris-real-story-behind-brexit-blueprint/) with their lack of support for Brexit. Generally, news reporting is factual and presented with a moderate left-leaning bias.
