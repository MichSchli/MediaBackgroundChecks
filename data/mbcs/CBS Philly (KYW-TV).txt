Analysis / Bias
In review, the CBS Philly website publishes sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and local news for the greater Philadephia region. Local news articles and headlines use minimal emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[Philadelphia Suburbs Enter Green Phase As Many Personal Care Businesses Reopen At 50% Capacity](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/06/26/philadelphia-suburbs-enter-green-phase-as-many-personal-care-businesses-reopen-at-50-capacity/). A video accompanies most stories from the TV station. National news stories are published by other [CBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) affiliates and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, CBS Philly does not publish op-eds; however, they report on politics with slightly more stories favoring the left, such as this

However, they frequently cover political news favorable to Republicans, and [Pennsylvania Republican Senators Propose Limiting Gov.

Most importantly, the reporters deliver political news with little opinion interjected. In general, CBS Philly reports news factually and with minimal bias.
