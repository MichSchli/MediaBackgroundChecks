History
[Founded in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Green_Footballs), Little Green Footballs (LGF) is an American political blog run by web designer Charles Johnson. In its beginning years, the site had a right-wing orientation and known for its advocacy of the War on Terrorism and the Iraq War, as well its strident criticism of political Islam. The blog moved away from the right around 2009, with Johnson rejecting the far right and began publishing information more favorable to the left.
According to their
[about page](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/about), “For 22 years Little Green Footballs has been a leading source of unique stories and opinion about news, politics, art, culture and music, as well as a host for one of the best commenting communities on the web, wonderfully free of the trolls and haters that plague most comment sections.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

[debunking viral stories](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/43751_Jim_Hofts_Unsourced_Claim_That_Officer_Darren_Wilson_Had_an_Orbital_Blowout_Fracture_of_the_Eye_Socket) and exposing [doctored photographs](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/21956_Reuters_Doctoring_Photos_from_Beirut). There are two primary sources of content on the website. Those written by owner Charles Johnson and those written by member bloggers. We will first cover Mr. Johnson’s work. Charles Johnson presents news from a left-leaning perspective. His articles frequently feature loaded emotional wording favorable to the left and derogatory toward the right, especially former President Donald Trump. Below are a few selections:
[Great Segment From Rachel Maddow: White House Struggles to Clean Up After Trump’s Incoherent Spectacle at G7](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/49250_Great_Segment_From_Rachel_Maddow-_White_House_Struggles_to_Clean_Up_After_Trumps_Incoherent_Spectacle_at_G7) [A Selection of the Embarrassing Bad Craziness of Trump at the G7](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/49248_A_Selection_of_the_Embarrassing_Bad_Craziness_of_Trump_at_the_G7) [The GOP’s Gun Violence Talking Points Revealed: Blame the Left, Don’t Talk About White Supremacism](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/49225_The_GOPs_Gun_Violence_Talking_Points_Revealed-_Blame_the_Left_Dont_Talk_About_White_Supremacism)
These three sample stories are properly sourced to the
[Tampa Bay Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tampa-bay-times/), [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/), and Tweets.
When not reporting on politics, Johnson frequently covers music news.
