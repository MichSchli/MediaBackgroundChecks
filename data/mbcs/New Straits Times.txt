Analysis / Bias
In 2020,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Malaysia 101/180 in their [Press Freedom Index.](https://rsf.org/en/malaysia) Stating that the media environment improved after the defeat of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, however, despite the progress “archaic laws still endure.”

Muhyiddin Yassin leans Right.
In review, The New Straits Times (NST) publishes articles with minimal emotionally loaded language such as
[“Azmin and Co back Dr. Mahathir as 8th prime minister”.](https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2020/02/569288/azmin-and-co-back-dr-mahathir-8th-prime-minister) They cover the current Prime Minister with a positive tone [“Muhyiddin rises to the occasion”](https://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnists/2020/03/578863/muhyiddin-rises-occasion). They also publish equally positive articles about the center-left opposition [“Anwar: Time to close ranks, move on”](https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2020/03/570671/anwar-time-close-ranks-move). Coverage of the USA tends to be negative in a tone such as this: [“Dr. Mahathir to Trump: Resign”.](https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/02/563698/dr-mahathir-trump-resign) In addition, they republish world news stories from [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). When it comes to sourcing they tend to rely on large quotes, rather than hyperlinks. In general news is reported factually and with a reasonable balance in story selection.
