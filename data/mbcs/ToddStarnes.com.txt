Analysis / Bias
In review, ToddStarnes.com publishes his radio program, news, and commentary from a hyperpartisan conservative perspective. Many news stories contain audio clips from the radio program. Articles and headlines frequently contain loaded emotional language, such as
[Bush, Romney & Powell Don’t Want to Make America Great Again](https://www.toddstarnes.com/politics/bush-romney-powell-dont-want-to-make-america-great-again/), and [Massachusetts AG Slammed for Comparing Bloody Riots to Wildfires](https://www.toddstarnes.com/values/massachusetts-ag-slammed-for-comparing-bloody-riots-to-wildfires/). Many stories are unsourced and rely on audio clips from the Todd Starnes radio program when it comes to sourcing information.
Editorially, the website has a section for opinion pieces that always favors the right and denigrate the left, such as this:
[LEFTIST TEARS: CNN’s Brian Stelter Wants You to Know He Crawled into Bed and Cried During Pandemic Meltdown](https://www.toddstarnes.com/opinion/leftist-tears-cnns-brian-stelter-wants-you-to-know-he-crawled-into-bed-and-cried-during-pandemic-meltdown/) and this [FREEDOM! President Trump Calls For the Liberation of Virginia, Minnesota & Michigan](https://www.toddstarnes.com/coronavirus/freedom-president-trump-calls-for-the-liberation-of-virginia-minnesota-michigan/). They also promote conspiracy theories, such as discussing how some people associated with the Clintons die tragically: [Bill and Hillary Clinton Sure Do Know A Lot of People Who Died Tragically](https://www.toddstarnes.com/show/bill-and-hillary-clinton-sure-do-know-a-lot-of-people-who-died-in-tragically/). A quote from the story states, “almost 50 people who have either died from suicide or in some tragic accident and they’re all closely connected to the Clintons. What do we make of this? Coincidence or is there something more nefarious going on here?”
In general, story selection almost always favors the right with stories promoting propaganda to denigrate the left, such as this:
[Fake Newsers Are A Bunch Of No-Good, Low-Down Liberal Liars](https://www.toddstarnes.com/politics/fake-newsers-are-a-bunch-of-no-good-low-down-liberal-liars/). A quote from the article reads, “They’re a bunch of low-down, no-good, liberal liars.”
ToddStarnes.com reports news with a far-right bias that is not always factual, as evidenced by several failed fact checks and the promotion of conspiracy theories, as seen above.
