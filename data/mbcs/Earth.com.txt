Analysis / Bias
In the article
[“Antarctic sea ice extent hit a record low this month,”](https://www.earth.com/news/antarctic-sea-ice-extent-hit-a-record-low-this-month/) Earth.com discusses the record low sea ice extent in Antarctica, citing researchers from [NASA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nasa/) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). However, the links in the article redirect to the main pages of these organizations rather than specific related content, which can be misleading for readers. This lack of direct citation can raise questions about the article’s thoroughness in providing sources. Despite this, the article’s tone and content suggest a pro-science stance, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing the changing climate.
Similarly, the piece
[“NASA initiates ambitious plan to bring the ISS back to Earth”](https://www.earth.com/news/nasa-initiates-ambitious-plan-to-bring-iss-back-to-earth/) focuses on NASA’s plans for the International Space Station. While the article provides informative content, it also provides links that lead to the main pages of cited organizations rather than specific related topics. For instance, The article mentions Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. Still, it does not provide a direct link to his work or statements and references to space agencies like NASA, CSA, ESA, JAXA, and Roscosmos redirect to the main pages of these organizations rather than specific content related to the topic.
Lastly, The article
[“All mention of climate change removed from federal websites”](https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-removed-websites/) discusses the removal of climate change mentions from federal websites during [President Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) administration. The article’s tone and content suggest a criticism of the Trump administration’s stance on climate change, indicating a left-leaning bias on this particular issue. The emphasis on the importance of addressing climate change and the negative portrayal of the removal of climate-related content from federal websites further supports this analysis.
In general, Earth.com is a pro-science source with a left-leaning editorial bias. They are usually fact-based but lack proper hyperlinked sourcing.
