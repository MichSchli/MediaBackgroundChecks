History
Initiated in 1990 by
[F. Mitterand and H. Kohl](https://www.thelocal.de/20190122/timeline-decades-of-franco-german-friendship) when they signed an agreement to increase cooperation between the two countries, ARTE was founded as a Franco-German television channel. ARTE is now a European cultural TV network, and it is [made up](https://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/files/arte_powerpoint_2019_en.pdf) of two original members, ARTE France and ARTE Deutschland TV GmbH. They have one central office based in Strasbourg, France, and 10 European partners. Currently, [Peter Boudgoust](https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2015/10/07/peter-boudgoust-new-arte-president-from-2016/) is the president.
ARTE produces diverse cultural programs, documentaries, magazine shows, concerts, short video clips about politics, and more. ARTE broadcasts in
[six languages;](https://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/files/dp_6langues_2019-04_en_web.pdf) French, German, English, Spanish, Polish and Italian,
Funded by / Ownership
ARTE is
[funded](https://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/funding/) by a combination of public funding (95%) through TV license fees from France and Germany, and they are also co-funded by the European Union. ARTE is a GEIE/EEIG, or European Economic Interest Grouping (legal entity that enables [cross-border alliances](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-107-6557?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&bhcp=1) in the EU) and owned by The two-member companies, which are ARTE France and ARTE Deutschland TV GmbH. As a public channel, ARTE states that they do not run any advertising, but they also state they “may generate some income of its own,” mainly through sponsorships.
Analysis / Bias
[Read our profile on France’s media and government](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-media-profile/) and [Germany’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/germany-media-profile/)
In review, Arte reports that 15% of their programs are news-related, and their news coverage, particularly in regards to Germany, has a biased tone, such as in this short video
[“Europe is Swamped with Migrants.”](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/087181-351-A/europe-is-swamped-with-migrants/) where they tackle Euromyths regarding immigration problems and Mass immigration to Estonia and Europe. In this video, ARTE uses emotionally loaded language describing Estonia, such as this quote from the video “No offense to Estonia, but it is not an attractive country; it is Germany that is taking over half of the new asylum seekers.”
Another one is titled
[“Euromyth No. 2 Germany Controls Europe,”](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/087181-352-A/germany-controls-europe/) where ARTE states, “Some see Angela Merkel as a dominant figure in Europe with Germany imposing its will over other EU member states,” and they conclude “Germany has just one vote in the Council, the same as any other member state.” On the contrary, Angela Merkel is often [dubbed](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/politico50/angela-merkel/) the “new leader of the free world”.
According to Sueddeutsche, Germany is said to have more
[key positions](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/eu-deutschland-baut-seine-macht-in-bruessel-aus-1.2588651) in the European Commission than any other European country. Germany is “considered Europe’s strongest nation, both politically and economically. “
The last video from the politics and society section we analyzed is
[“A Populist Future Euromyth No 12,”](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/087181-362-A/a-populist-future/) where they conclude, It is not a myth that “EU populist parties are on the rise with the far-right making significant gains by exploiting the migrant crisis.” and “It’s up to European citizens in European elections to decide what kind of Europe they want.”
ARTE also produces documentaries which are
[55% ](https://www.arte.tv/sites/en/corporate/what-we-do/)of the programs, such as [“Re: The Fall of Hasankeyf Historic Remains Threatened by Rising Waters](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/090637-051-A/re-the-fall-of-hasankeyf/),” which brings awareness to the 12,000 years old Turkish heritage site of Hasankeyf, which is threatened by a hydroelectric dam. Another documentary we reviewed is about high-tech surveillance systems in Europe, The United States use, and China, [“7 Billion Suspects The Surveillance Society”](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/083310-000-A/7-billion-suspects/). The rest of the programs are 25% feature films and 5% featuring the performing arts.
Editorially, they are pro-EU and promote liberal perspectives such as Feminism,
[Screaming Against Patriarchy](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/086089-044-A/screaming-against-patriarchy/), and pro-environmental positions such as this [Europe is Letting Our Planet Die](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/087181-361-A/europe-is-letting-our-planet-die/).
