History
Founded in April 2007 by Peter Lipson, a doctor of internal medicine, RationalWiki Analyzes and refutes pseudoscience and the anti-science movement, documenting the full range of crank ideas, explorations of authoritarianism and fundamentalism, analysis and criticism of how these subjects are handled in the media.
From a historical perspective, RationalWiki was
[created](https://web.archive.org/web/20100326214700/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19/2) as a response to [Conservapedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservapedia/), which is routinely critical of liberals and atheists. MBFC lists Conservapedia as a Questionable source based on the publication of right-wing Christian Propaganda, as well as false reports.

Analysis / Bias
In review, RationalWiki is a wiki site that is open source and editable by anyone. RationalWiki is different from
[Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/) in that it openly uses loaded language to describe conservatives and those who promote conspiracies and pseudoscience. In general, RationalWiki does not attempt to hide its bias as they routinely poke fun at conservatives. This has led to them being labeled leftists. Perhaps RationalWiki leans left, but in the end, they are a pro-Science source. In general, all information is sourced from credible sources of evidence, much like Wikipedia.
