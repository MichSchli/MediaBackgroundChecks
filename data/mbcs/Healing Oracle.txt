History
Healing Oracle completely lacks transparency as there is no about page nor disclosure of authors or ownership. Essentially, this is a quackery-level pseudoscience website that publishes alternative health and wellness news. According to a
[domain search](http://whois.domaintools.com/healingoracle.ch), the domain was registered in 2010. One author does appear on the website occasionally by the name of [Amanda Mary Jewell](https://healingoracle.ch/tag/amanda-mary-jewell/), who apparently ran a wellness clinic in Belize and [claims to be a cancer researcher](https://healingoracle.ch/2018/03/02/mirror-and-people-newspaper-threaten-shock-article-over-amanda-mary-jewell-on-the-command-of-fiona-oleary/) from the UK ( [she is not](https://www.businessinsider.com/in-closed-facebook-groups-pushing-unproven-treatments-2019-8)). We cannot verify this; however, [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/in-closed-facebook-groups-pushing-unproven-treatments-2019-8) seems to indicate that is the case.
A bio section on Amanda Mary Jewell reads, “I do have a list of qualifications, but I find them cumbersome and false. The fact I am a qualified Holistic Doctor is neither here nor there. Medical education is entirely corrupt and something that can be used against you. I go on courses in order to learn, not to buy a badge to hide behind or a stick to beat people with.” This website also does not offer a disclaimer that the medical opinions expressed are not backed by science.
Finally, In May 2019, Healing Oracle was
[banned by Facebook](https://healingoracle.ch/2019/08/11/farewell-facebook-see-me-on-mewe/).
Funded by / Ownership
Healing Oracle does not disclose ownership. Revenue is derived through donations as well as
[selling services](https://www.businessinsider.com/in-closed-facebook-groups-pushing-unproven-treatments-2019-8) such as GcMAF treatments, which according to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/in-closed-facebook-groups-pushing-unproven-treatments-2019-8), individuals are charged up to $25,000 at her clinic in Belize, which was never registered as a medical clinic. You can read more about GcMAF below.
Business Insider further reports “that Jewell closed down the clinic earlier this year after authorities in Belize started looking into it. The clinic was never officially sanctioned by the Ministry of Health, so we only interviewed her once, and she was told what our problem was with her ads and clinic, and she said she was leaving; a follow-up visit two days later confirmed that she had basically left overnight.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, Healing Oracle is one of the most blatant scam pseudoscience sites we have encountered, and we have reviewed many. The website covers many typical themes such as
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), [miracle cancer cures](https://healingoracle.ch/2017/03/27/i-gave-my-dying-son-cannabis-to-ease-his-cancer-symptoms-and-he-made-a-miracle-recovery-reveals-mum/), and even a [cure for Autism](https://healingoracle.ch/2019/07/10/gcmaf/) which at this point is [not possible](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-cures/). With that said, the primary purpose of this website is to promote expensive GcMAF treatments, which stands for Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor, a protein that is produced by modification of [vitamin D-binding protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D-binding_protein).
Long story short, GcMAF has been promoted as a
[cure for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), HIV, [Autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/), and other conditions; however, there [isn’t any credible evidence](https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2008/12/03/cancer-cured-for-good-gc-maf-and-the-miracle-cure/) to indicate this is the case. In other words, this source is profiting from the promotion of pseudoscience and false hope.
After Covid-19, they promoted conspiracy theories and pseudoscience related to the vaccines
[HOW DNA VACCINE TECHNOLOGY COULD GENETICALLY MODIFY HUMANITY](https://healingoracle.ch/2020/06/24/how-dna-vaccine-technology-could-genetically-modify-humanity/). In general, the Oracle is a crackpot.
