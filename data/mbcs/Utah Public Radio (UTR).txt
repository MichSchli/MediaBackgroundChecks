Analysis / Bias
UPR sources news locally with reporters on the ground and internationally through partnerships with highly factual, left-leaning sources such as
[NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [PRI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/public-radio-international-pri/), and [CBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/). Like other NPR stations, there is minimal use of loaded language, and all reports are grounded in fact. There is a slight left-leaning bias in story selection that favors the left.
