[vision](https://www.americanpartisan.org/about/): “We will be the very best source for American Partisans with relevant reviews of gear, firearms and communications equipment, foreign and domestic intelligence summaries, and political commentary.”
According to their

Analysis / Bias
In review, American Partisan reports news with a conservative bias. They publish articles regarding guns such as
[“PSA AK-104: The Perfect Kalash?”](https://www.americanpartisan.org/2021/11/psa-ak-104-the-perfect-kalash/) and use sources such as palmettostatearmory.com. There is a strong use of emotionally loaded language, such as [“Iran: Biden’s Vietnam.”](https://www.americanpartisan.org/2020/11/iran-bidens-vietnam/)
American Partisan utilizes factually mixed sources such as
[Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/) and credible sources such as [Council on Foreign Relations.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-on-foreign-relations/) Primarily they aggregate news from other sources via RSS. Most of the source feeds are from right-leaning questionable and conspiracy sources such as [ One America News Network (OAN)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/), [lewrockwell.com,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/) [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [ ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr-news-natural-news/), and [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) [.](https://buchanan.org) They also use a few credible sources such as [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [DW](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/), and [France 24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/). Further, the website carries articles by notable conservative writers such as Patrick Buchanan.
Editorially, they favor the conservative right and promote pseudoscience and conspiracy theories such as this
[Martin Armstrong: Bayer Head Admits COVID-19 Vaccine is Gene Therapy](https://www.americanpartisan.org/2022/06/martin-armstrong-bayer-head-admits-covid-19-vaccine-is-gene-therapy/). The claim that the Covid vaccine alters DNA has been [debunked](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/03/instagram-posts/covid-19-vaccines-are-not-gene-therapy-and-forbes-/) numerous times. Finally, they also promote baseless election fraud claims from discredited sources such as [Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/): [Mike Lindell: Absolute Proof – Exposing Election Fraud and the Theft of America](https://www.americanpartisan.org/2021/02/mike-lindell-absolute-proof-exposing-election-fraud-and-the-theft-of-america/). Studies have concluded that there was [no evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) of systematic election fraud.
In general, American Partisan is far-right biased and relies on poor sources who frequently fail fact checks and promotes right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories.
