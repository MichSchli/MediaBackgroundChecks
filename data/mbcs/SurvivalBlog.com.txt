History
[Founded in 2005](https://survivalblog.com/about/), SurvivalBlog was created and written by James Wesley Rawles (“JWR”), who is a [novelist.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wesley_Rawles) Mr. Wesley clearly spells out the direction of his blog here: “I am a Christian, and hold to [Reformed doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Church). My view of history is of the [geographical determinist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671624113?ie=UTF8&tag=survivalcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0671624113) school. My view of economics is of the [Austrian school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School). Politically, I am a [Constitutionalist Christian libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Christian_libertarians). All of these have shaped my views on preparedness. HJL has very similar views.” He is also a frequent guest on the infamous conspiracy [Alex Jones Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) show.

Analysis / Bias
In review, this website serves as a resource for those who want to prepare for the worst. Especially disasters that will be man-made or natural. This source, in particular, sees globalism as the real threat in which they are calling for a
[second civil war](https://survivalblog.com/coming-second-civil-war/). They also use loaded emotional language to describe headlines such as this: [The Leftist Lexicon: Translating Statist Rhetoric Into Plain English, by Ray X.](https://survivalblog.com/the-leftist-lexicon-translating-statist-rhetoric-into-plain-english/) Further, SurvivalBlog is overtly Christian such as this: [Spiritual Preparedness for Hard Times, by ZeBo](https://survivalblog.com/spiritual-preparedness-for-hard-times-by-zebo/). When it comes to sourcing of information, there is not much here besides the bible.
