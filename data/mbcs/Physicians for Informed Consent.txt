History
[Founded in 2015](https://whois.domaintools.com/physiciansforinformedconsent.org) by [Shira Miller](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/leadership/shira-miller-md-bio/), Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC) is an organization that opposes mandatory vaccinations. They state their [mission](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/about/) as “The mission of Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC) is to deliver data on infectious diseases and vaccines, and unite doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals, attorneys, and families who support voluntary vaccination. The vision of Physicians for Informed Consent is that doctors and the public are able to evaluate the data on infectious diseases and vaccines objectively, and voluntarily engage in informed decision-making about vaccination.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Physicians for Informed Consent advocate for voluntary vaccinations with no mandates. The website provides educational materials, videos, and news on vaccinations. The organization also writes letters to
[politicians](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/pic-letter-to-congressman-gohmert-doctors-and-scientists-support-for-h-r-5816-national-informed-consent-exemption-nice-act/) and files Amicus Briefs such as this [Physicians for Informed Consent Files Amicus Curiae Brief in Crucial Parental Rights and Informed Consent Lawsuit](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/physicians-for-informed-consent-files-amicus-curiae-brief-in-crucial-parental-rights-and-informed-consent-lawsuit/). Finally, they also serve as a lobbying group in California promoting no vaccine mandates, and they set up booths at [alternative health events](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/events/) to promote their agenda.
When reporting on vaccines (Flu, Measles, Covid-19, etc.), they have been
[accused of cherry-picking](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/physiciansforinformedconsent.org?cid=1a2d1594-d48e-4d8e-859b-fd76d29dcae1) information from credible sources.
Another
[educational article](https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/aluminum-in-vaccines/) claims that aluminum in vaccines can be unsafe. The [consensus of science](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/common-ingredients-us-licensed-vaccines) does not support this. In general, Physicians for Informed Consent promotes anti-vaccination viewpoints that [Newsguard](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/physiciansforinformedconsent.org?cid=1a2d1594-d48e-4d8e-859b-fd76d29dcae1) has called “misleading.”
