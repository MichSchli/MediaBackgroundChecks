History
Founded as a website in 2015, BB4SP or Barracuda Brigade is a hyperpartisan conservative news and opinion website. The website is owned and edited by Alicia Luke. According to their
[about page](https://bb4sp.com/about-me/), they are “100% committed to spreading common-sense conservative principles!” They state their mission is to “promote and protect individual rights and freedoms as set forth in the United States Constitution and to limit the scope of government to the authority set forth therein. I’m fed up with the out-of-control government!” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Barracuda Brigade reports news from other sources and adds conservative commentary to the stories. Articles and headlines frequently use loaded emotional language such as
[Pelosi’s More Interested In Investigating Trump Than China On Coronavirus](https://bb4sp.com/pelosis-more-interested-in-investigating-trump-than-china-on-coronavirus/). Like many on the website, this story is sourced from tweets and other social media posts. Story selection always favors the right with a section dedicated to favorable news regarding former President Trump, such as this [Trump RIPS ‘FBI Scam’ Against Michael Flynn](https://bb4sp.com/trump-rips-fbi-scam-against-michael-flynn/) and another section that reports negatively on President Obama and Hillary Clinton: [Hillary Implies Kavanaugh Will Lead America Back To Times Of Slavery](https://bb4sp.com/hillary-implies-kavanaugh-slavery/). When it comes to sourcing, they sometimes use very poor sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), and many other questionable far-right sources that consistently fail fact checks.
The Barracuda Brigade often promotes misleading information and conspiracy theories, especially related to Coronavirus. For example, they report the conspiracy that US Dramatically Overcounting Coronavirus Deaths are overcounting Covid-19 deaths. This is false. According to
[JAMA Internal Medicine](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/07/about-30-covid-deaths-may-not-be-classified-such), it is estimated that Coronavirus deaths are undercounted by 28%. Further, BB4SP has been placed on [Newsguard’s Coronavirus misinformation tracker list](https://www.newsguardtech.com/coronavirus-misinformation-tracking-center/). Other conspiracies they have promoted are the [Seth Rich Murder](https://bb4sp.com/bombshell-new-report/) and those involving [George Soros](https://bb4sp.com/alan-dershowitz-i-have-proof-obama-ordered-fbi-investigation-at-request-of-george-soros/), the Deep State, and others. Finally, BB4SP has been placed on [Politifact’s Fake News List](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/?platform=hootsuite).
