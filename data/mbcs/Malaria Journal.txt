History
The Malaria Journal is a peer-reviewed open-access journal published by BioMed Central (BMC) covering research on malaria. According to its
[about page](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/about), “Malaria Journal is aimed at the scientific community interested in malaria in its broadest sense. It is the only journal that publishes exclusively articles on malaria and, as such, it aims to bring together knowledge from the different specialities involved in this very broad discipline, from the bench to the bedside and to the field.”
Founded in 2000, BioMed Central, or BMC, is a United Kingdom-based, for-profit scientific open-access publisher. They publish more than 300 journals that are entirely online. According to their about page, “Our leading research journals include selective titles such as
[BMC Biology](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/), [BMC Medicine](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/), [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/) and [Malaria Journal](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/), academic journals such as [Journal of Hematology & Oncology](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/), [Malaria Journal](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/), and [Microbiome](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/), and the [BMC series](https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals), 65 inclusive journals focused on the needs of individual research communities.

Analysis / Bias
Malaria Journal is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to malaria research. The journal primarily publishes research like this:
[Vectorial competence, insecticide resistance in Anopheles funestus and operational implications for malaria vector control strategies in Benin Republic](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-023-04815-9).
BioMed Central (BMC) is an open-access publisher of scientific journals. There are two types of Open Access Journals, legitimate and predatory, both of which charge the author for publication.
[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. BioMed Central is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, BMC journals have been criticized for [retracting numerous studies](https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/mass-retraction-35728) due to fake peer reviews or poor methodology.
Although BMC has retracted some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed, the Malaria Journal publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
