Analysis / Bias
In review, the Waco Tribune-Herald covers local news via journalists and with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[State to seek death penalty in 2 capital murder cases](https://www.wacotrib.com/news/courts_and_trials/state-to-seek-death-penalty-in-capital-murder-cases/article_08ae5f15-4290-54a6-9f95-d088ae0520e9.html). National news is covered exclusively by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, the Waco Tribune-Herald reasonably represents both sides. A review of editorial articles demonstrates a reasonable low bias; however, slightly more op-eds favor the right. While more op-eds favor the right, liberal perspectives have fair representation; therefore, they earn a least biased rating on the right side of the scale. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
