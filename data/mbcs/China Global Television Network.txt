Analysis / Bias
[Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/china) has reported China as the “World’s leading prison for citizen journalists” According to [Reporters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) Without Borders 2023 report; China ranks 179 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, which equates to almost zero press freedom. [According](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/23/the-voice-of-china-will-be-a-squeak/) to [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), CGTN is a part of a global [$6.6 billion media](https://www.economist.com/node/15607496) expansion [campaign](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/china-state-television-global-expansion) involving TV, radio, and newspapers that started in 2009 during the presidency of Hu Jintao, Xi’s predecessor. The purpose of this is to serve as a global mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.
In review, China Global Television Network (CGTN) uses a neutral tone when reporting national political news such as
[“Yizhuang will host Beijing’s first test road for self-driving vehicles.”](https://news.cgtn.com/news/7741544d77677a6333566d54/share_p.html) They typically utilize factually mixed sources such as [Xinhua News Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/xinhua-news-agency/), and further, when reporting world and USA news China Global Television Network (CGTN) utilizes minimally loaded words in their articles, and they do present low biased coverage of USA news through the use of credible sources such as [AFP,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and [Reuters.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) However, this does not mean they are without bias. Most articles about the Communist Government are favorable with zero criticism of President Xi Jinping. In other words, the content you find on the website is generally factual and neutral in tone, but it is the consistent bias by omission that makes CGTN a factually Mixed and propaganda source.
