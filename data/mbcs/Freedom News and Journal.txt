[Freedom News and Journal](https://freedomnews.org.uk/history/) is a London-based anarchist news site and journal published by Freedom Press once per year. According to their about page, they describe themselves as “We are socialists, disbelievers in property, advocates of the equal claims of all to work for the community as seems good — calling no-one master, and of the equal claim to each to satisfy as seems good to them, their natural needs from the stock of social wealth they have laboured to produce …We are anarchists, disbelievers in the government of the many by the few in any shape and under any pretext.” [Read our profile on UK media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-kingdom-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Freedom News and Journal cover the topics under categories: News, World, Analysis, Features, and reviews. The analysis section includes editorial and satire content.
In review, the content of the editorials and headlines use emotionally loaded words such as:
[“Polish Government’s War on Women”](https://freedomnews.org.uk/polish-governments-war-on-women/) and [“Trump’s UK visit and the royal wedding offer avenues for mass action](https://freedomnews.org.uk/trumps-uk-visit-and-the-royal-wedding-offer-avenues-for-mass-action/). “ Freedom News generally quotes left-leaning credible sources such as [New York Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-magazine/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) [,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/), and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/windsor-homeless-royal-wedding-council-leader-simon-dudley-a8140636.html), as well as right-center biased sources such as the [London Evening Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/london-evening-standard/) and local sources such as hopenothate.org.uk. A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=freedomnews.org.uk&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have never failed a fact check.
Editorially, the content is one-sided in favor of Left-wing anarchism, such as this
[A note on Facebook’s crackdown against US anarchist groups.](https://freedomnews.org.uk/2020/08/20/a-note-on-facebooks-crackdown-against-us-anarchist-groups/) They also hold an anti-conservative position and promote anti-fascism [East German anti-fascist conspiracy trial to start this week](https://freedomnews.org.uk/2021/09/06/east-german-anti-fascist-conspiracy-trial-to-start-this-week/). The content is primarily factual; however, the reporting is one-sided and lacks ownership transparency.
