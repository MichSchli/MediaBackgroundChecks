[Salt Of The Earth](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/542/salt-of-the-earth). All stories are well-sourced. While this source is not overly political, stories tend to favor the left, such as this [Ralph Nader On Taking Back Power From The Corporate State](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/521/the-great-work) and this [Mary Christina Wood On Avoiding Climate Disaster](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/518/before-its-too-late). In general, the news reported is factual and with a moderate left-leaning bias.
