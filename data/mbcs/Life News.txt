Analysis / Bias
In review, Lifenews.com primarily reports on anti-abortion news using loaded language such as this:
[Bishop Slams Andrew Cuomo for Signing Bill Legalizing Abortions Up to Birth: You’re No Catholic](https://www.lifenews.com/2019/01/23/bishop-slams-andrew-cuomo-for-signing-bill-legalizing-abortions-up-to-birth-youre-no-catholic/). Sourcing for this article comes from the factually mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). Lifenews.com also covers political news with a strong right-wing bias such as this: [Seven Times the Liberal Media Swooned Over Their Liberal Heroes This Year.](https://www.lifenews.com/2018/12/26/seven-times-the-liberal-media-swooned-over-their-liberal-heroes-this-year/) This story is also poorly sourced to the factually mixed [NewsBusters. ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsbusters/)
In general, all stories on LifeNews.com favor a far-right Christian perspective and routinely denigrate liberal ideology.
