Analysis / Bias
In review, we will focus on the website as that is what is available to check. The website has headlines loaded with sensationalism, such as
[Dear Violent Liberal Rioters: YOU Are the Fascist Nazis!](http://louderwithcrowder.com/dear-violent-liberal-rioters-you-are-the-fascist-nazis/). Within this article, there is not a single link to an outside credible source. Every link links to another Louder With Crowder article, a red flag for a credible source. When it comes to science, Steven Crowder is not a fan of the consensus when it comes to [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as this: [Sorry, But You Can’t Scare Me Into Believing Man-Made Climate Change Hysteria](https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sorry-but-you-cant-scare-me-into-believing-man-made-climate-change-hysteria/).
Louder with Crowder attempts to source their information; however, it mostly links back to previous articles on the website or other right-leaning sources such as
[Campus Reform](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/campus-reform/) and the [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/). Steven Crowder also frequently criticizes transgender persons with articles such as this: [Dear Gay-Trans Bullies: Sorry, the Rest of Us Still Have Rights…](https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dear-gay-trans-bully-pulpit-sorry-the-rest-of-us-still-have-rights/) In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left with strong, emotionally loaded headlines.
