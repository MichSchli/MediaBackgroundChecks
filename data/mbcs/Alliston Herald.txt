In review, the Alliston Herald uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Town of Innisfil testing ways to slow down drivers in three hot spots](https://www.simcoe.com/news-story/10716506-town-of-innisfil-testing-ways-to-slow-down-drivers-in-three-hot-spots/). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
