History
The Patriot Nurse is an online platform operated by an
[anonymous individual](https://whois.domaintools.com/thepatriotnurse.com) offering courses and content focusing on medical preparedness, herbalism, and holistic health. The exact founding details are sparse, but the platform has been active for several years, promoting self-sufficiency in health care, particularly in crisis situations. The website also features strong, right-leaning content, especially the associated YouTube channel.
The Patriot Nurse
[claims](https://www.patriotnurseacademy.com/about-us) to be a [registered nurse](https://autismum.com/2012/01/25/the-patriot-nurse-a-letter/) with certifications as a master herbalist and allopathic medical certifications. She also holds memberships as an NRA Life Member, Gun Owners of America – Lifetime Member, and Tennessee Firearms Association – Life Member. She is also a GLOCK Certified Armorer, NRA Certified Pistol Instructor, and Glock Sport Shooting Foundation Lifetime Member. Unfortunately, due to a complete lack of transparency, we cannot verify if the above claims are true.

Analysis / Bias
ThePatriotNurse.com website generally serves as a vehicle to market or sell Ms. Greene’s products. The website offers links to her online preparedness courses, live training sessions, and a store that sells herbal products like this
[Patriot Nurse’s Starter Stash – 20 Herbs](https://www.thepatriotnurse.com/products/top-20-herbs-starter-stash). This herb package is currently on sale for $480. The store also has a bookshelf, which is currently empty.
The website also links to
[Ms. Greene’s YouTube Channel](https://www.thepatriotnurse.com/pages/recent-videos), where she offers advice and conservative political opinions. The channel features videos on alternative health and many videos promoting right-wing conspiracy theories like this [Protect Yourself Against Medical Tyranny With These 5 Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RxE5gJq1cs) and this promoting a so-called invasion at the Texas border [Civil War Echoes: Unpacking Governor Abbott’s Defiance in the Texas Border Clash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL9fpPCt3AY). Both of these narratives advance common conservative ideologies.
In another story, she leads with a headline that is false:
[Hawaii Bans 2nd Amendment- Constitutional Crisis Takes Shape?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zXz1MOvNgE) The claim of an outright ban on the Second Amendment in Hawaii is false. While Hawaii has strict gun control laws, these do not equate to a ban on the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The legal landscape around the Second Amendment involves a balance between individual rights and public safety considerations, with states having the leeway to regulate firearms in a manner consistent with Supreme Court rulings and constitutional protections.
In general, the Patriot Nurse promotes a conservative narrative, frequently expressing negative opinions about Transgender care like this
[Are You SURE You Want to Go to the Pediatrician?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEkCb6uJerE) While not all information on this site is false. It is often entirely one-sided, which can be misleading as it leaves out important context for the reader/listener.
