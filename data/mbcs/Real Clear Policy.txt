In review, RealClearPolicy frequently uses emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[â€œ](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2018/08/13/trump_tower_meeting_looks_increasingly_like_a_setup.html) [ Trump v. Big-City Mayors and Woke Radicals](https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/508509-trump-v-big-city-mayors-when-the-feds-should-and-shouldnt-act).
Generally, story selection moderately favors the Right, and RealClearPolicy takes a conservative stance. RealClearPolicy typically sources their information to credible sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/); however, they also source factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/).
