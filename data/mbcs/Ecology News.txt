This website completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page or disclose ownership. News posts link to either JD Heyes, Mike Adams, or Ethan Huff and none of them have biographical information listed on the website. A Google search shows that JD Heyers is the Sr. Correspondent with the Conspiracy/Pseudoscience website News Target.

Funded by / Ownership
Ecology News does not disclose ownership or funding, however, it is assumed to be a part of the Natural News Network. Revenue appears to be derived from online advertising as well as links to the Natural News Store that sells supplements and alternative health products.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Ecology News publishes news that is primarily related to the environment and ecological systems. However, a majority of news focuses on human-influenced climate change denial such as this: Global warming a total “hoax and scam” run by corrupt scientists, warns Greenpeace co-founder. This article is sourced to far-right unreliable sources such as Breitbart and Natural News. The website features a search bar that searches with Good Gopher, a search engine designed to search Mike Adam’s properties. Through using the search bar most searches returned information from the highly questionable News Target. Using this search bar results in anti-vaccination propaganda as well as chemtrails and other pseudoscience/conspiracy information. The bottom line, this is an unreliable source for information.
