History
The
[Mises Institute](https://mises.org/about-mises) is a non-profit libertarian think tank from Auburn, Alabama, which promotes the philosophy of Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard’s Austrian School of free-market economics and anarcho-capitalism. Mises Institute was [founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mises_Institute) in 1982 by [Lew Rockwell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/), Murray Rothbard, and Burton Blumert. Mises Institute states its [mission](https://mises.org/wire/mises-institute-ranked-9th-most-influential-us-think-tank) as “to promote the Misesian tradition of thought through the defense of the market economy, private property, sound money, and peaceful international relations while opposing government intervention.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
According to independent.org, Ludwig von Mises was initially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. A quote from the
[article](https://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=692) states, “Mises himself in the years immediately after he came to the United States were kept afloat financially through generous grants from the Rockefeller Foundation.” Mises Institute [states](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/2017%20Annual%20Report%20Mises%20Org.pdf) that The institute “operates as a non-profit corporation using funds donated almost entirely by individuals. Our donors are our shareholders.” However, they don’t reveal those [donors](https://mises.org/giving/donor-privacy-policy).

Analysis
Mises Institute consists of sections such as Mises Wire, Blog Media, virtual courses under the Learn Online section, and a store where they sell books.
In review, Mises Institute publishes articles with a critical tone of the Trump administration. They use strong, emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“AS DEMOCRATS PUSH A “WEALTH TAX,” HERE’S WHY OTHER COUNTRIES GOT RID OF IT,”](https://mises.org/power-market/democrats-push-wealth-tax-heres-why-other-countries-got-rid-it) and [“Trump Shows Us Why Its So Hard to “Drain the Swamp.”](https://mises.org/wire/trump-shows-us-why-its-so-hard-drain-swamp) Paul-Martin Foss authors this second article, and a quote from the article reads, “If Trump supporters don’t wake up and recognize what is transpiring very soon, by the time they realize that they’ve been hoodwinked and that Trump has become the establishment’s Manchurian president it will be too late.” Finally, Mises frequently publishes articles that attempt to portray socialism negatively, such as this: [Two Reasons Why Socialism Repeatedly Fails](https://mises.org/wire/two-reasons-why-socialism-repeatedly-fails). In general, story selection mostly favors the Libertarian right.
Bias
Although they utilize credible sources such as
[AOL](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/aol/), [Vanity Fair](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vanity-fair/), [Washington Examiner,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Scientific American](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/scientific-american/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/), [The American Conservative](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-american-conservative/), [Reason.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/), and mixed sources such as the [Wall Street Journal,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) they also utilize conservative blogs such as [danieljmitchell](https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/the-growing-threat-of-a-wealth-tax/) to back their claims.
When it comes to science, Mises does not deny the existence of
[human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). However, they consistently downplay the consequences and [reject government intervention](https://mises.org/wire/fear-global-warming-markets-offer-our-best-chance-survival) as a solution. Further, their founder Lew Rockwell has published outright human-influenced [climate change denial](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2009/06/david-deming/global-warming-is-a-fraud/) on his blog. Mises has also promoted pseudoscience by claiming that [MMR vaccines cause autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/): [CDC, PHARMA, And Mainstream Media On The Same Team](https://mises.org/wire/cdc-pharma-and-mainstream-media-same-team).
According to the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), Mises Institute scholars [promoted](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/mainstream) “anti-immigrant views” and “promotes a type of Darwinian view of society in which elites are seen as natural and any intervention by the government on behalf of social justice is destructive.” Further, Ludwig von Mises states in [Human Action](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/661), “It is nonsensical to fight the racial hypothesis by negating obvious facts. It is vain to deny that up to now certain races have contributed nothing or very little to the development of civilization and can, in this sense, be called inferior.”
