The website does not have an about page or disclose ownership. News stories appear to be published by Ron Kersten, Samantha Foster, and Joe Callen. The website does not list bios, and a Google search was also not helpful in figuring out who they are.

Analysis / Bias
In review, 24 News takes a current right biased news story and interjects opinion around the content. Article headlines contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[Ocasio-Cortez Attacks PRAYER After New Zealand Mosque Attack, Twitter Explodes from All Sides](http://us24news.com/ocasio-cortez-attacks-prayer-after-new-zealand-mosque-attack-twitter-explodes/). News stories are generally sourced to reasonable media outlets or videos and Tweets. However, in some cases, they use Questionable sources such as [ILoveMyFreedom](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/i-love-my-freedom/). In general, story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left.
A factual search does not turn up any failed fact checks; however, some of the sources used by this website have failed numerous fact checks.
