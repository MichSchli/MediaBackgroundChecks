Analysis / Bias
According to Reporters Without Borders, the media environment in India is threatened by increasing
[nationalism](https://rsf.org/en/india): “self-censorship is growing in the mainstream media and journalists are increasingly the targets of online smear campaigns by the most radical nationalists.”
In review, Asian News International (ANI) reports national news with minimally emotionally loaded headlines such as:
[“It’s an action-packed visit for PM Modi in Singapore.”](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/its-an-action-packed-visit-for-pm-modi-in-singapore201805311507110001/) The wording of the articles is also relatively neutral and balanced. ANI primarily sources information to itself as they are the source and provider of news. ANI reports international news with low bias as they use credible mainstream news agencies of the relevant countries such as: [“Russian foreign minister to visit N Korea ‘soon](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/russian-foreign-minister-to-visit-n-korea-soon201805300627180001/).’”
ANI has faced
[criticism](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/ani-reports-government-version-truth) for frequent favorable reporting on Center-Right Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
