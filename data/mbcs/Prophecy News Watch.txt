Analysis / Bias
In review, all articles are delivered with a right-wing Christian perspective. Prophecy News Watch frequently publishes anti-Muslim articles such as this:
[Welcome to America, Terrorists! Right This Way for Student Visas!](http://www.prophecynewswatch.com/article.cfm?recent_news_id=1995#bbDq9BjVGe8TvvXY.99). This particular story comes from the [Gatestone Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gatestone-institute/), which frequently publishes right-wing based anti-Muslim articles. Prophecy News Watch also publishes conspiracy theories such as this: [Preparing The Way For The Mark Of The Beast? Bitcoin & Bible Prophecy](http://www.prophecynewswatch.com/article.cfm?recent_news_id=1939#IW6GzrT0KjJKZHAF.99). The only sourcing for this information is bible passages. In general, this is a low-information site that routinely misleads.
