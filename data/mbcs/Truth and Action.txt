History
[Founded in 2013](http://whois.domaintools.com/truthandaction.org), Truth and Action is a news and opinion website with extreme right-wing bias in reporting. The primary focus of the website is Prepping, Survival, and Gun Rights. The website does not have an about page, nor does it disclose ownership; however, they do describe itself on its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/TruthAndAction/about/?ref=page_internal): “I’m tired of saying nothing & doing nothing. It’s time we rally together, get the truth out & make changes to the system.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Truth and Action typically takes news stories from other sources and then summarizes them or adds additional commentary from a conservative perspective. Headlines use moderately loaded language such as this
[Ocasio-Cortez: The Electoral College is a ‘Scam’ That Hurts Minorities](http://www.truthandaction.org/ocasio-cortez-electoral-college-scam-hurts-minorities/). This story is sourced back to [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/).
Truth and Action also frequently publishes right-wing conspiracy theories such as this:
[New Video Exposes Potential Fraud Committed by Rep. Ilhan Omar](http://www.truthandaction.org/new-video-exposes-potential-fraud-committed-rep-ilhan-omar/). The source for this story is [Alpha News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/alpha-news/), which we have rated as “Questionable based on extreme right bias, poor sourcing of information, promotion of conspiracy theories and anti-Islamic propaganda, as well as a lack of transparency regarding ownership.” A fact check reveals the fraud claims against Ilhan Omar [have not been proven](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/jul/18/did-ilhan-omar-marry-her-brother-her-hometown-news/).
Truth and Action also report on
[False Flags](http://www.truthandaction.org/category/politics/false-flags/) and promote [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). This latter story on vaccines is sourced to the highly discredited [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), which frequently advances right-wing conspiracy theories and dangerous pseudoscience. The website also promotes debunked conspiracy theories regarding Fluoride, such as this: [Drink filtered water: Harvard Study Shows Flouride lowers IQ in children and promotes neurotoxicity in adults](http://www.truthandaction.org/drink-filtered-water-harvard-study-shows-flouride-lowers-iq-children-promotes-neurotoxicity-adults/). The claim that fluoride lowers IQ has been [debunked](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277240.php) by subsequent studies.
Editorially, Truth and Action 100% favors the right and former
[President Donald Trump](http://www.truthandaction.org/obama-official-calls-military-state-rebellion-president-trump-refuses-accept-2020-election-defeat/).
