History
[Founded in October 2020](https://conservativeplaylist.com/about-us/), the Conservative Playlist anonymously runs the conservative news, video, and podcast aggregator. According to their about page, they state, “we are no longer trying to be “ [the next Drudge](https://conservativeplaylist.com/were-not-trying-to-be-the-new-drudge-we-are-building-something-better/).” We’re shooting for something better that will bring the best news stories, videos, and podcasts to the masses.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not name the people involved or who owns the website.
