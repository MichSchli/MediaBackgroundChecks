In review, The Waterloo Record uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Police investigating report of sexual assault at Kitchener restaurant](https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2023/06/03/police-investigating-report-of-sexual-assault-at-kitchener-restaurant.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
