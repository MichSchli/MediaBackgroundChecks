They also own the [National Geographic Channel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-geographic/)and broadcasts from [New York, NY](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). [Roger Ailes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes)was the founding CEO. Roger Ailes resigned in 2016 after many accusations of sexual harassment. [Jay Wallace](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-news-exec-jay-wallace-gets-candid-competition-ratings-q-a-1070362)became president of the network, and [Suzanne Scott](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/business/media/fox-news-suzanne-scott.html), the CEO of FNC, as of May 2018.

[terms of use](https://www.foxnews.com/terms-of-use), “Company furnishes the Company Sites and the Company Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment.” This has led some to declare that Fox News is now an entertainment company and does not have to uphold journalistic standards.

On 12/12/2021 – 18-year, veteran journalist Chris Wallace
[resigned from Fox News](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/585671-wallace-departure-from-fox-seen-as-loss-for-the-network) and joined [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/).

In 2022, Fox News was sued for Defamation by
[Dominion Voting Systems](https://abcnews.go.com/US/fox-news-sean-hannity-set-deposed-part-billion/story?id=89069237) for 1.6 billion dollars due to alleged false claims and conspiracy theories related to the companies voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. According to the lawsuit’s court docket, [Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sean-hannity-bias-rating/), [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) and Jeannine Pirro, and former [Fox Business](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-business/) host [Lou Dobbs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lou-dobbs-bias-rating/) will be deposed. [On 04/18/2023](https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-news-media-dominion-voting-systems-reach-agreement-over-defamation-lawsuit), Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit for $787 million where they were accused of promoting false claims and conspiracy theories against Dominion Voting Systems during the 2020 elections. A statement by Fox reads as follows:
“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems,” the network said Tuesday in a statement. “We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”
[On 4/24/2023](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2023/04/24/tucker-carlson-leaves-fox-news/), Tucker Carlson, the top-rated prime-time news host, left Fox News for undisclosed reasons.

Analysis
According to a Pew Research Center
[survey](http://www.journalism.org/2017/01/18/trump-clinton-voters-divided-in-their-main-source-for-election-news/), “Fox News was the main source for 40% of Trump voters” during the 2016 election. Further, another Pew [Survey](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/) indicates, “When it comes to choosing a media source for political news, conservatives orient strongly around Fox News. Nearly half of consistent conservatives (47%) name it as their main source for government and political news.” Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 35% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 46% do not, ranking them #11 in trust among the major USA news providers.
Fox News typically looks at the issues from a conservative perspective. Also, it has several on-air personalities that are strong supporters of former President Trump, such as
[Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sean-hannity-bias-rating/), [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) (former), [Laura Ingraham](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/laura-ingraham-bias-rating/), and [Dan Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dan-bongino-bias-rating/) (former); thus, during the Trump Presidency, FNC typically skewed conservative as there was less criticism of Trump.
Bias
In review, FNC publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as
[Biden says ‘MAGA Republicans’ threaten democracy as he and Dems crank up anti-Trump rhetoric ahead of midterms](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-maga-republicans-threaten-democracy-dems-hammer-trump-emphasize-social-issues-before-midterms) and [White House defends slamming half of America as ‘semi-fascist,’ ‘terrorists’ despite Biden’s unity pledge](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-shrugs-question-bidens-recent-semi-fascist-rhetoric-we-understand-we-hit-nerve).
After the 2020 election, Fox News TV personalities advanced false and unproven conspiracy theories regarding election fraud
[Questions linger over the Left’s plot against Donald Trump](https://web.archive.org/web/20210804205241/https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/questions-linger-over-the-lefts-plot-against-donald-trump). Numerous audits and [studies](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) reveal that election fraud during the 2020 election was average and had no impact on the election’s outcome. Further, as noted above, they promoted [conspiracy theories](https://www.smartmatic.com/uploads/Smartmatic_Complaint_Against_Fox_Corporation.pdf) related to Dominion Voting Machines.
TV personalities also advanced false claims and conspiracies on the following issues:
[No guns at the capitol riot](https://web.archive.org/web/20220610022039/https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-truth-happened-jan-6-unknown) ( [False](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2022/06/15/fact-check-were-firearms-other-weapons-capitol-jan-6/7621149001/)), [Trump authorized the National Guard for the Capitol Riot](https://web.archive.org/web/20220204203723/https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-january-6-committee-subpoena-pelosi) ( [No Evidence](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/10/facebook-posts/no-proof-trump-asked-troops-jan-6-or-democrats-den/)), [FBI orchestrated insurrection](https://web.archive.org/web/20220626211818/https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-government-agents-helped-organize-capitol-riot) ( [False](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/06/conservative-outlets-advance-unfounded-theory-about-capitol-attack/)), [The USA funds Biolabs in Ukraine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424165141/https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tucker-the-pentagon-is-lying-about-bio-labs-in-ukraine) ( [False](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-no-there-are-no-us-funded?s=r)), [Numerous instances of Covid-19 vaccine disinformation](https://web.archive.org/web/20220703153049/https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-how-many-americans-have-died-after-taking-the-covid-vaccine) ( [False](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html)). Further, according to [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), FNC has also been deemed the [least accurate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/29/punditfact-checks-cable-news-channels/) cable news source.
Finally, Fox News also features fact-based news reporting by beat reporters and some daytime TV hosts. However, this credible news reporting is buried between TV programming promoting Right Leaning propaganda and false claims. The website is similar, with credible news stories between hyper-partisan questionable content from their nighttime TV hosts.
In general, Fox News’ beat reporters produce low-biased fact-based news; however, the reporting on their entertainment-based news programming frequently promotes propaganda and false claims that render Fox News Questionable.
