Analysis / Bias
Forbidden News Network publishes articles highlighting controversies, conflicts, and issues in China. The tone of the articles can be sensational, with an emphasis on conflicts and disputes. While some events reported are factual, as we verified that reputable sources like
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) report them, the presentation and interpretation of these events can be biased.
For instance, the article “A 13-Year-Old Girl In Henan Who Eats Snacks As A Meal And Loves To Play With Her Phone While Drawing 2 Liters Of Blood Is “Milky White.” is about the
[13-year-old girl](https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/cbnews/20230729/1913655.html) who developed health issues after consuming snacks. The Headline contains emotionally loaded language, and when it comes to sourcing, typically, Forbidden News Network does not provide direct sources or references to the story, making it challenging to verify the claims. Furthermore, they link every word to a different page. For instance, they hyperlink the word snack, and if clicked, it directs the user different page tagged with that word.
Another article we analyzed, “11 DEAD IN QIQIHAR GYMNASIUM,” about the
[roof collapse](https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/cbnews/20230729/1913656.html) in a gymnasium in Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, is factual as Western media, such as Reuters [reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ten-killed-after-school-gymnasium-roof-collapses-china-2023-07-24/) the incident, and [Chinese sources](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/24/WS64bda90da31035260b817fe4.html) also report it. However, the Forbidden News Network article does not provide credible sources and uses vague phrases like “some people revealed on the internet,” “this situation reminds people,” and “many people believe.” These phrases do not specify the sources or the extent of the sentiments expressed, making it unclear whether these are widely held views or opinions of a few individuals. Also, although it accurately reported the event, its emphasis on conflicts between parents and hospital staff, increased police presence, and comparisons to previous incidents might reflect a specific narrative or perspective.
Politically, Forbidden News reports positively on former President Trump, such as this:
[Trump Mercilessly Unleashes On Biden In Speech Following Arraignment In Federal Court](https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/taiwannews/20230614/1896646.html). When reporting on [President Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), they often report negatively, such as this: [INTERVIEWS WITH BIDEN SCANDAL WITNESSES: THEY KILLED A REAL EVENT BEFORE THE ELECTION](https://www.bannedbook.org/sitesearch.php?q=biden). This story is from [Tucker Carlson’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) former [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) program, which has a [poor record](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tucker-carlson/) with fact-checkers.
