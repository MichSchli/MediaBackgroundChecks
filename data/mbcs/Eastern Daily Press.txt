Analysis / Bias
The Eastern Daily Press provides news coverage, including politics, health, sports, crime, business, and the environment for Norfolk and northern parts of Suffolk and eastern Cambridgeshire. Local news reporting is often covered with minimal bias, such as this
[Man airlifted to hospital after being hit by a motorbike](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/man-in-yarmouth-airlifted-to-hospital-8221624). This story is properly sourced back to one of the many local affiliate sites. The paper does not cover international news and instead focuses on purely local news and information.
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion content, of which many are related to sports news. In reviewing dozens of news articles and opinion pieces, they present both sides and usually do not interject emotional language to sway the reader. Further, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have reported accurately reflecting a pro-science position such as this
[Norwich sees Covid cases rise by 39pc in a week](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/health/norwich-norfolk-coronavirus-cases-rising-8219582). In general, the Eastern Daily Press produces low biased factual local news content.
