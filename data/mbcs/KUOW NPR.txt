[University of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington), but is operated by KUOW Puget Sound Public Radio, a nonprofit community organization. Revenue is derived through Listeners, Members, and Business contributions. The organizations also get funding from the University of Washington and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the KUOW-NPR website reports news and radio programming information with minimal bias. News on the website is derived from
[NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and often utilizes minimally loaded language such as this [House Democrats Unveil 2 Articles Of Impeachment Against Trump](https://kuow.org/stories/house-democrats-unveil-2-articles-of-impeachment-against-trump). This story is fact-based and cites quotations and first-person accounts.
In general, story selection tends to slightly lean left, through some negative coverage of former President Trump and positive coverage of Democrats, but there is a consistent, credible balance.
