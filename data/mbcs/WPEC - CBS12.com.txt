Funded by / Ownership
In 2011, WPEC was bought by
[Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group), a publicly-traded American telecommunications company controlled by the family of company founder [Julian Sinclair Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Sinclair_Smith). The company is the largest television station operator in the United States by a number of stations, and largest by total coverage; owning or operating a total of 193 stations across the country (233 after all currently proposed sales are approved) in over 100 markets (covering 40% of American households), many of which are located in the South and Midwest.
Sinclair has been scrutinized by multiple media outlets for consistently favoring conservative politics. They are considered a
[rival to right biased Fox News](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/business/dealbook/sinclair-media-expansion-fox-conservative-media.html?_r=0) for the conservative audience. [The Seattle Times](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020756844_fishersinclairxml.html) has written a piece documenting Sinclair’s right-wing bias. Further, according to the [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), the Sinclair Broadcast Group has [donated](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000029062&cycle=2016) $1,143,508 or 80% to Republican candidates since 1994.
Finally, in March 2018, Sinclair ordered its stations to produce promos with an “anchor delivered journalistic responsibility message” dictated by the company.
[The wording of the mandated script](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html) was criticized by some station news staff and outside pundits for its discussion of “fake news,” with some critics arguing that the message used similar language and rhetoric to Donald Trump. [Trump responded](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/980799183425802240?lang=en) to the promos on April 2, 2018, defending the company as being “far superior to [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and even more Fake [NBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), which is a total joke.”
Revenue is generated through advertising and cable subscription fees.

In review, CBS12.com reports local news on the website with minimal bias such as this:
[Speeding couple gets baby delivery help, not ticket](https://cbs12.com/news/local/speeding-couple-gets-baby-delivery-help-not-ticket). National and World news is syndicated through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Editorially, op-eds tend to favor the right, with minimal criticism of President Trump: [Florida GOP hearts Trump](https://cbs12.com/news/local/florida-gop-hearts-trump). Other opinion-based commentary tends to lean slightly right, though there is a reasonable balance. In general, CBS12.com reports news accurately and with minimal bias.
