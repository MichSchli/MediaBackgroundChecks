Analysis / Bias
In review, the Angus Reid Institute utilizes emotionally loaded language in its articles such as
[“Canadians aren’t as accepting as we think — and we can’t ignore it, writes Angus Reid”](http://angusreid.org/multiculturalism-analysis/) and [“Truths of reconciliation: Canadians are deeply divided on how best to address Indigenous issues.”](http://angusreid.org/indigenous-canada/) Angus Reid also frequently performs polls that analyze the importance of religion in society, such as this: [“Spirituality in a changing world: Half say faith is ‘important’ to how they consider society’s problems](http://angusreid.org/religion-in-canada-150-part-two/).”
Angus Reid’s polls have faced criticism by The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada (ARCC)
[“Angus Reid Takes Sides – With the Anti-Choice”](http://www.arcc-cdac.ca/presentations/angus-reid-takes-sides.html) and also criticism regarding right-leaning bias [“Canada’s hate-on for Omar Khadr: how Angus Reid’s (really) bad poll fueled a Conservative party “outrage” hoax.”](https://nowtoronto.com/news/omar-khadr-angus-reid-poll/)
Angus Reid discloses how they conduct surveys through online research and how random sampling is impossible in an era of anti-spam regulations. They also often use credible sources such as
[The Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-star/), [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) (national statistical office), [ CBC News (Canadian Broadcasting)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/), and [Global News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-news/). [FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/), an expert on measuring and rating pollster performance, has evaluated 31 polls by Angus Reid, indicating they are accurate 92% of the time or Very High Factual. They also conclude that their polling favors the Right with a score of +1.1, which equates to a Right-Center bias in polling. In general, ASR is a very accurate pollster that slightly favors the right (Conservative Candidates).
