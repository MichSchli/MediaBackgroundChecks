Analysis / Bias
In review, Japan Today publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as this republished through
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/): [“String of missteps slash Abe’s support rates”.](https://japantoday.com/category/politics/String-of-missteps-slash-Abe-support-rates) This article is critical of the right-leaning Abe Government and sourced through local newspapers such as [Asahi newspaper](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-asahi-shimbun/) and [Mainichi](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mainichi-shimbun-bias-credibility/) newspapers without providing hyperlinks. Japan Today also republishes from Soranews24 with emotionally loaded language such as this [“Japanese politician gets caught watching crocodile video during Diet session”.](https://japantoday.com/category/politics/japanese-politician-gets-caught-watching-crocodile-video-during-diet-session) The politician in this story is from the right-leaning ruling party LDP, a quote from the article reads “Japanese netizens were amused by Hirai’s viewing habits.” The article also provides reactions from people that are critical of both the politician and government “If he were watching a cat video, I’d forgive him,” “This is how our taxes are being used…” Further, the article is poorly sourced. Japan Today publishes crime stories without sensationalizing such as this: [“3 youths arrested for throwing concrete blocks from bridge onto expressway.](https://japantoday.com/category/crime/3-youths-arrested-for-throwing-concrete-blocks-from-bridge-onto-expressway)”
When it comes to sourcing Japan Today often sources through quotes, utilizes credible sources through republishing Reuters, and also sources Japanese news agency Kyodo News and SoraNews24 (news blog from Japan). Although they do not use hyperlinks, the sources they utilize are credible.
Reporting on the USA and, in particular, former President Donald Trump often selects news that is negative toward his previous administration
[Trump lashes out at scientists whose findings contradict him.](https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-lashes-out-at-scientists-whose-findings-contradict-him) In general, they report news factually and with a left-leaning bias.
