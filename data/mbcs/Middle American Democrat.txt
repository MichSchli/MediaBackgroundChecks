Analysis / Bias
In review, Middle American Democrat reports news with a consistent left-wing bias and frequently uses loaded language such as this:
[Trump lies to military again about their pay](https://middleamericandemocrat.com/2018/12/27/trump-lies-to-military-again-about-their-pay/). This story is reasonably sourced to the [HuffPost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/) and [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/). The primary target for this website is President Donald Trump, with some articles making claims that are not supported by evidence. For example, in this article, [Donald Trump is mentally ill – If you don’t already believe that, just read these quotes](https://middleamericandemocrat.com/2018/08/26/donald-trump-is-mentally-ill-if-you-dont-already-believe-that-just-read-these-quotes/), they use quotes from Donald Trump to establish his mental illness, which is not evidence. In general, story selection always favors the left and reports negatively on the right.
