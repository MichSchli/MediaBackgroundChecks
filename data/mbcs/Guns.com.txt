Funded by / Ownership
Guns.com does not disclose its funding, but it is apparent gun advertising is a major contributor based on advertising on the website.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Guns.com does exactly as stated on their about page. They report on guns, the industry, and the politics of gun ownership/control. Guns.com uses minimal loaded words, and they source all information appropriately. Politically, Guns.com favor the right through reporting that favors the GOP and pro-gun positions, but again this is well-sourced and fairly balanced.
