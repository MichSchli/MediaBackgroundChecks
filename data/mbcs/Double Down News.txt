Analysis / Bias
DDN advocates for progressive social causes, including racial justice, economic justice, and civil rights. Their reporting often employs emotionally loaded language, as seen in headlines like “

Yet, we could confirm several important points with existing data, including the UK’s role in arms exports, COVID-19 impacts, and socio-economic issues.

The second video analyzed,
[“Israel & The Myth of ‘Self Defence,”](https://www.doubledown.news/watch/2023/october/13/israel-myth-of-self-defence-david-hearst) portrays the Israel-Palestine conflict from a Palestinian perspective, using emotionally loaded language like “crimes against humanity” and “wipe Gaza out” to provoke emotional reactions and emphasize Palestinian suffering reflects a bias towards the Palestinian cause and criticism of Israeli policies. For this video analysis from DDN, we confirmed some key points with existing data, including the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Hamas’ violations of international law, and the impact of Israeli military actions in Gaza.
- Israeli Settlers: There are currently about
[700,000](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-advances-peak-number-west-bank-settlement-plans-2023-watchdog-2023-07-13/)Israeli settlers living in 279 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
- Hamas’ Actions Against Civilians: The claim that Hamas has committed crimes against humanity is supported by statements from the House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, who declared that Hamas has committed
[war crimes](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-declares-hamas-committed-acts-of-genocide-crimes-against-humanity-war-crimes-calls-upon-state-department-to-determine-same/)against the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Amnesty International also documents violations of international law by Hamas, including war crimes, such as hostage-taking and the abduction of civilians, which are prohibited by international law.
- Israeli Actions in Gaza: Amnesty International documented Israeli forces’ actions in Gaza, causing significant civilian casualties and property destruction, including the killing of more than

Although most information on the website is rooted in facts, they have given a voice to a known purveyor of misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccines, Dr. Aseem Malhotra.
[Dr. Malhotra](https://healthfeedback.org/authors/aseem-malhotra/) has a poor fact-check record, often spreading inaccurate information about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines. In general, Double Down News holds a progressive left editorial bias and presents information in a one-sided fashion.
