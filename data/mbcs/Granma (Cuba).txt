History
Founded in 1965, Granma is the official newspaper of The Communist Party Of Cuba Central Committee and headquartered in Havana, Cuba. Published in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Italian, Granma covers National News and Politics, World News, Culture, Tourism, and Sports. Since the Cuban Government and its only political party, The Communist Party of Cuba, controls the paper, Granma is regarded as a government mouthpiece. Granma also states on its
[about page](http://en.granma.cu/quienes-somos) that the newspaper is “loyal to the Party’s policy, its ethical principles, in both its focus on events unfolding within Cuban society and international relations.”
In 2017, The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party promoted
[Yailin Orta Rivera](http://www.granma.cu/cuba/2017-12-05/promovida-yailin-orta-rivera-como-directora-del-periodico-granma-05-12-2017-21-12-08) to be the director of “Granma.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Granma publishes articles utilizing loaded headlines such as
[The blockade asphyxiates and kills, just like the virus, and must end,”](http://en.granma.cu/mundo/2021-06-24/the-blockade-asphyxiates-and-kills-just-like-the-virus-and-must-end) and [Within the Revolution there continues to be room for everything and everyone, except those who seek to destroy the collective project.”](http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2021-06-29/within-the-revolution-there-continues-to-be-room-for-everything-and-everyone-except-those-who-seek-to-destroy-the-collective-project)
Editorially, Granma holds a far-left bias through the promotion of Marxism. Furthermore, Granma also publishes articles that glorify Fidel Castro, such as this article dated 1988,
[“Why we don’t need more than one party.”](http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2021-07-12/why-we-dont-need-more-than-one-party) The basic editorial position of the paper is to advance Communist Party propaganda.
Additionally, they regularly criticize American Foreign Policy
[“Washington’s accusation in its report that Cuba engages in people trafficking is a lie Declaration by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs”](http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2021-07-05/washingtons-accusation-in-its-report-that-cuba-engages-in-people-trafficking-is-a-lie) and they completely lack linked sourcing. In general, Granma promotes a strong left-wing bias with the endorsement of Marxism and pro-Government propaganda. Finally, Granma cannot seem to glorify Fidel Castro enough.
