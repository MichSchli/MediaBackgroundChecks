History
The Morning Poll is a conservative-leaning news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://morningpoll.com/about-us/), they state “Presidential Wire brings you the week’s most important news and views for staying informed, free and self reliant.” This is not the Presidential Wire website.
The website lacks transparency as it does not disclose its conservative leanings or name authors, editors, and ownership. The domain is registered with information redacted for privacy.

Funded by / Ownership
The Morning Poll lacks transparency as they do not provide ownership information. However, the contact page provides a physical mailing address @
[1985 Henderson Rd STE 1156 Columbus, OH 43220](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pak+Mail/@40.0545541,-83.0736699,56m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88388d84b97e5c39:0xa3e179426055c5b3!8m2!3d40.0545979!4d-83.0736413). This address leads to a strip mall and a company called [Pak Mail](https://www.pakmail.com/mailbox-rental), which provides shipping services and personal and business mailbox rentals. It appears Patriotic Post has rented a mailbox with Pak Mail.
Further, when searching the mailing address, we found several other conservative websites linked to this mailbox rental. This is what we have discovered thus far:
These websites have the same design and appear to be owned by the same company/person. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The Morning Poll does not conduct original reporting. Instead, they curate news from other sources and add conservative commentary. Articles and headlines feature loaded emotional wording such as this
[Biden Video Producer Suggests Cops Worse Than Pigs](https://morningpoll.com/biden-video-producer-suggests-cops-worse-than-pigs/). This story does not provide a hyperlinked source.
Regarding sourcing, most articles do not utilize hyperlinked sourcing which is unacceptable for a web-only publication. In reviewing numerous articles, we found they generally rely on questionable right biased sources such as
[American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/).
Editorially, most stories strongly favor the right, and former President Donald Trump, such as this
[Biden Leaves His Basement for Luxury Beach House Break](https://morningpoll.com/biden-leaves-his-basement-for-luxury-beach-house-break/).
Finally, The Morning Poll has promoted
[Covid-19 disinformation.](https://morningpoll.com/republican-senator-stops-ohio-officials-banning-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-treatment/) In general, The Morning Poll is a far-right biased source that promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience that are not rooted in fact.
