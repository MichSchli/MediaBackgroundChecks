[John Ricardo I. “Juan” Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Cole), an American academic and commentator on the modern Middle East and South Asia. He is a Richard P. Mitchell Collegiate Professor of History at the University of Michigan. According to their [about page](https://www.juancole.com/about), “Drawing on the insights of expert journalists, activists, and academics, we strive to publish the deep geopolitical analysis that’s readable for a general audience. And unlike most foreign policy-oriented publications, our editorial line isn’t dictated by beltway think tanks or corporate boards.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Informed Comment uses mild to moderate loaded words in their headlines and articles. All articles tend to have a left-leaning perspective related to the middle east and politics in general.
Editorially, most stories favor the progressive left, such as this
[We’re not at War: Why is Congress giving $778 Billion of our Money to the Pentagon?](https://www.juancole.com/2021/12/congress-billion-pentagon.html) And this [As Climate Emergency Shakes Iran, Government Attacks, arrests Water Protesters at Isfahan, wounding 3](https://www.juancole.com/2021/11/emergency-government-protesters.html). These stories are sourced from credible information such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and The Nation. In general, the news is mostly factual and left-leaning in bias.
