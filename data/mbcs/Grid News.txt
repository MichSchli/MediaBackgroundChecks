History
[Launched in 2022](https://whois.domaintools.com/grid.news), Grid News is an explainer journalism news website and newsletter based in Washington DC. According to their [about page](https://www.grid.news/about-us/), they state “Grid’s mission is to connect with an audience that wants a deeper, clearer understanding of the world around them, regardless of their political orientation. We provide the facts and context necessary to understand how world events, persistent challenges, and mega-trends are connected to one another — and require connected solutions.”
The website is fully transparent regarding staff, the board, and authors but less clear on ownership. Mark Bauman is the current President and CEO who has “oversaw various media businesses at the
[Smithsonian Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/smithsonian-magazine/) and [National Geographic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-geographic/). He also covered international conflicts for [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/), as well as for a number of newspapers and magazines.”
On 03/23/2023, Neiman Lab reported that “Grid is being absorbed into The Messenger, a forthcoming news site that plans to employ 550 journalists within a year while changing “
[the face of the media landscape](https://themessenger.com/).” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Grid News conducts original reporting through journalists in the following categories: 360, Global, Economy, Politics, Climate, Science, Technology, and Misinformation. The primary focus is on
[explainer journalism](https://www.fipp.com/news/what-is-explainer-journalism/). Put simply, explainer journalism “attempts to get behind the news to give the reader background information about a story to ensure that they are able to properly understand events as they unfold.”
Articles and headlines often contain moderately loaded emotional language that favors the left, such as this
[Fake vaccine cards are everywhere. It’s a public health nightmare](https://www.grid.news/story/science/2022/01/25/fake-vaccine-cards-are-everywhere-its-a-public-health-nightmare/) and [The excruciatingly long, slow ‘death’ of coal](https://www.grid.news/story/climate/2022/01/20/the-excruciatingly-long-slow-death-of-coal/). All articles reviewed offer excellent sourcing from credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [The Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and Columbia University.
Editorially, many stories favor perspectives that align with the left, such as concern for climate change
[It is always disaster season](https://www.grid.news/story/climate/2022/01/19/it-is-always-disaster-season/), and supportive articles concerning Joe Biden [What if a law on the books derails the 2024 presidential election? Trump’s team tried it in 2020.](https://www.grid.news/story/politics/2022/01/21/saving-democracy-starts-with-rewriting-the-electoral-count-act/) Under the “misinformation” category they accurately report on [Covid misinformation](https://www.grid.news/story/360/2022/01/11/how-misinformation-about-pregnancy-and-covid-vaccines-became-deadly-conventional-wisdom/) and Donald Trump’s baseless conspiracy theories regarding election fraud, [The Big Lie’s lasting damage to American democracy](https://www.grid.news/story/misinformation/2022/01/24/the-big-lies-lasting-damage-to-american-democracy/). Finally, while most stories favor the left, they do offer criticism as well, such as this [‘A tactical mistake’: Inside the Democrats’ year of failed attempts to mend a fraying democracy](https://www.grid.news/story/politics/2022/01/14/a-tactical-mistake-inside-the-democrats-year-of-failed-attempts-to-mend-a-fraying-democracy/). Grid News generally holds a strong Left-Center bias editorially and reports news factually.
