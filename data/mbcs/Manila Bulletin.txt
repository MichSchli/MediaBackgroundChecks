Analysis / Bias
In 2022,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/), the Philippines is “Holding the line against Duterte’s attacks.” They further report, “Three Philippine journalists were killed in 2019, probably by thugs working for local politicians, who can have reporters silenced with complete impunity.”
In review, the Manila Bulletin publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as this”
[“Duterte tells daughter Sara: Be true to your country”](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/05/31/duterte-tells-daughter-sara-be-true-to-your-country/) and [“Palace appeals: Respect Duterte’s remarks against Robredo.”](https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/07/11/palace-appeals-respect-dutertes-remarks-against-robredo/) Regarding sourcing, the Manila Bulletin does not use hyperlinks and relies on quotes. Reporting on international news comes from the [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they do not criticize President Duterte and usually glorify him, such as this:
[Duterte: Send me hospital bills of stranded Filipinos with COVID-19](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/05/29/duterte-send-me-hospital-bills-of-stranded-filipinos-with-covid-19/). When reporting on USA politics, such as news pertaining to former President Trump, they rely on the Least Biased AFP: [Trump urges the US to reopen as daily death toll spikes](https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/05/06/trump-urges-us-to-reopen-as-daily-death-toll-spikes/). The Manila Bulletin generally publishes factual news; however, a strong pro-Government bias leaves out negative news and criticism. Therefore, we consider them to be a source that promotes state propaganda.
