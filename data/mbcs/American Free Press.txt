Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Free Press publishes news with extreme right-wing, nationalist, racist, and antisemitic views. Headlines often use loaded wording such as this:
[The Media’s Love Affair With Hate Crimes](https://americanfreepress.net/the-medias-love-affair-with-hate-crimes/). This story does not provide a single hyperlinked source to validate their claims. The website also publishes 9/11 conspiracies such as this: [San Diego 9/11 Truth Group Perseveres](https://americanfreepress.net/san-diego-9-11-truth-group-perseveres/). They also frequently endorse Zionism and antisemitism, such as this: [Someone Tell Trump: It was Jews, Not Arabs, Dancing on 9-11](https://americanfreepress.net/someone-tell-trump-jews-not-arabs-dancing-9-11/). Finally, they also promote [anti-vaccination pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this: [What Ever Happened to the Vaccine-Autism Commission?](https://americanfreepress.net/what-ever-happened-to-the-vaccine-autism-commission/) In general, the American Free Press is not credible on any level.
