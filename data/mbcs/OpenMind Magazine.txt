Analysis / Bias
OpenMind Magazine has a tagline that reads “tackling science controversies and deceptions.” The website offers essays submitted by writers and experts in their fields. Topics cover cognition, culture, conspiracies, deceptions, and controversies. Articles and headlines use moderately loaded language such as this
[Algorithms, Lies, and Social Media](https://www.openmindmag.org/articles/algorithms-lies-and-social-media). The articles reviewed rely on credible sourcing such as [Freedom House](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-house/), scientific journals, [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/), and [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/).
Editorially, they support pro-science positions, which at this time aligns with the left, especially as it relates to Covid-19. For example, in the article
[The Murky History of Lab Leaks](https://www.openmindmag.org/articles/the-murky-history-of-lab-leaks) the author goes in-depth, examining the history of lab leak conspiracies throughout time. The author explains how conspiracy theories are an easy way to describe situations when there is no evidence to support a conclusion.
At the time of this review, there is very little content to draw a conclusive bias rating, but all signs point to a low biased, perhaps left-leaning source that promotes fact-based information.
