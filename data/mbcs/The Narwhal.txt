History
[Founded in 2018 by Carol Linnitt and Emma Gilchrist](https://thenarwhal.ca/about-us/), The Narwhal is an online magazine that reports on climate change and the environment in Canada. Linnitt and Gilchrist worked together on the [Desmog Blog](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/desmog/), a website that exposes climate misinformation and the funding of anti-climate organizations and companies.
According to their

Analysis / Bias
The Narwhal publishes in-depth reports, analyses, and opinion pieces related to climate change and the Canadian environment. News articles use moderately loaded emotional headlines that reflect the article’s content, such as this
[Here’s the dirt: how Doug Ford is shaping Ontario’s environmental laws in his second term](https://thenarwhal.ca/ontario-environment-ford-explainer/). Like all others reviewed, this story is properly sourced to credible outlets such as government sites and the [National Observer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-observer-canada/).
Editorially, The Narwhal is often critical of the fossil fuel and logging industries, with reports such as this
[Documents reveal how Alberta oil and gas industry used pandemic to push ‘wish list’](https://thenarwhal.ca/capp-oil-lobbying-alberta-government/). They also appropriately label opinion pieces that strongly favor progressive left perspectives, such as this [The ‘new’ face of environmental racism in Quebec](https://thenarwhal.ca/opinion-quebec-caribou-environmental-racism/). In general, The Narwhal is fact-based and holds progressive left editorial positions.
