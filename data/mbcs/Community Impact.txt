Community Impact does not publish op-eds and heavily focuses on business news such as this
[Texas State Optical celebrates one year of business in Buda](https://communityimpact.com/austin/san-marcos-buda-kyle/impacts/2021/05/30/texas-state-optical-celebrates-one-year-of-business-in-buda/). Finally, the websites provide news on local government written with a neutral tone, such as this [John Escoto sworn in to Shenandoah City Council](https://communityimpact.com/houston/the-woodlands/government/2021/05/27/john-escoto-sworn-in-to-shenandoah-city-council/).
