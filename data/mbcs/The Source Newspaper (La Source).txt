Analysis / Bias
The Source Newspaper, when it comes to Canadian news, is left-biased. For example, they often utilize emotionally loaded language in their headlines and articles such as
[“Whose side are they on? Big money, big media and the coming B.C. election”](http://thelasource.com/en/2017/03/06/whose-side-are-they-on/) and are always well sourced to credible media such as the [Globe and Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-globe-and-mail/) and through the use of direct quotes. When reporting US news, they generally are anti-Trump and anti-conservative. For example: [“Only bold, progressive politics can stop the spread of the Trump virus.”](http://thelasource.com/en/2016/11/21/only-bold-progressive-politics-can-stop-the-spread-of-the-trump-virus/)
