Analysis / Bias
In review, all articles are sourced and well-written. There is minimal use of loaded language, though story selection tends to favor the left as this source is a very pro-environment source such as this
[What can I do about climate change? Fourteen ways to take positive action](https://www.positive.news/environment/what-can-i-do-about-climate-change-how-to-lower-your-carbon-footprint/). Under the opinion section, there are also left-leaning opinions such as this [‘Why we shouldn’t call today’s children the ‘Covid generation’ – but ‘the remarkables.”](https://www.positive.news/opinion/why-we-shouldnt-call-todays-children-the-covid-generation-but-the-remarkables/)
Most stories favor a socially equitable world and climate justice; therefore, we rate them Left-Center Biased and factual in reporting based on proper sourcing.
