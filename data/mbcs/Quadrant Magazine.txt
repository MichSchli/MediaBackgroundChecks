Analysis / Bias
In review, Quadrant frequently uses loaded words in headlines and articles such as
[Burn, Climate Witches, Burn](https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2018/03/burn-climate-witches-burn/). This article is also one of [many](https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/) that question whether humans influence climate change. They have also been accused of creating [scientific hoaxes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/quadrant-magazine-scientific-hoaxer-revealed-1267335.html). Quadrant usually sources their information but sometimes uses poor sources such as [Judith Curry](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-etc/). Essentially, all articles favor the right and conservative causes.
