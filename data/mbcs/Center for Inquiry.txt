History
[Founded in 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Inquiry), The Center for Inquiry (CFI) is a nonprofit educational organization. Its primary mission is to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values. According to their [about page](https://centerforinquiry.org/about/), they are “dedicated to [defending science](https://centerforinquiry.org/our-issues/legislation-watch/) and [critical thinking](https://centerforinquiry.org/blogs-magazines/) in examining religion. CFI’s vision is a world in which evidence, science, and compassion—rather than superstition, pseudoscience, or prejudice—guide [public policy](https://centerforinquiry.org/our-issues/office-of-public-policy/). [In January 2016,](http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/an_important_announcement_from_cfi_president_ronald_a._lindsay/) the [Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins_Foundation_for_Reason_and_Science) announced that it was merging with the Center for Inquiry, with [Robyn Blumner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Blumner) as the CEO of the combined organizations.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the CFI website features its important issues and news reports. Under the “
[Our Issues](https://centerforinquiry.org/our-issues/)” tab, they publish news and information about religious freedom, the negatives of religion, and pro-science information regarding health and medicine. The website also publishes [position papers](https://centerforinquiry.org/our-issues/position-papers/) that often debunk pseudosciences, such as [acupuncture](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-directory-acupuncture/) and the harm of religious fundamentalism.
Another aspect of the website is its
[Legislation Watch](https://centerforinquiry.org/our-issues/legislation-watch/) page which shows proposed government legislation bills and CFI’s stance on them. For example, they support the [ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL ACT (H.R. 2567)](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/congress_bills/access-to-birth-control-act-h-r-2567/) but do not support the [DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACT (H.R. 354)](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/congress_bills/defund-planned-parenthood-act-h-r-354/). Further, CFI frequently investigates [paranormal activities](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/stagecoach_tavern_ghosts/) and ultimately debunks them.
As a means to gauge political bias, we searched the website using the following keywords and documented the tone of those articles:
[Trump](https://centerforinquiry.org/s/?_sf_s=trump)– Consistently Negative [Clinton](https://centerforinquiry.org/s/?_sf_s=clinton)– Neutral to Positive [Conservative](https://centerforinquiry.org/s/?_sf_s=conservative)– Consistently Negative [Liberal](https://centerforinquiry.org/s/?_sf_s=liberal)– Mostly Positive [LGBTQ](https://centerforinquiry.org/s/?_sf_s=LGBTQ)– Positive
