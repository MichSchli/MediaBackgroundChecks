Analysis / Bias
The Detroit Metro Times covers local arts, food, culture, music, entertainment, and news for the Detroit Area. Local news is generally reported via staff writers, with some in-depth pieces. Straight news uses minimally loaded words such as this:
[Whitmer set to veto Senate’s ban on abortion procedure](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/05/14/whitmer-set-to-veto-senates-ban-on-abortion-procedure). News stories are generally sourced through quotes, first-hand accounts, or hyperlinks.
Editorially, the Detroit Metro Times leans strongly left with opinion pieces such as these:
[We should all be embarrassed by Betsy DeVos’ 60 Minutes interview](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2018/03/12/we-should-all-be-embarrassed-by-betsy-devos-60-minutes-interview) and [5 bullshit claims at Trump’s raucous rally in Grand Rapids](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/03/29/5-bullshit-claims-at-trumps-raucous-rally-in-grand-rapids).
