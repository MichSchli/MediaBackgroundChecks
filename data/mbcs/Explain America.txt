Analysis / Bias
Explain America publishes news and commentary on USA politics favorable toward former President Trump and conservatives
[Trump Fires Back After Biden’s DOJ Appoints Special Counsel](https://explainamerica.com/3563195/). They do not publish original reporting but rather take an existing story and add conservative commentary.
Articles and headlines usually contain emotionally charged wording such as this
[‘Con Artist’ Hunter Biden Turns Heads After Paintings Sell for Hundreds of Thousands](https://explainamerica.com/5763491/). In another story, they denigrate Democrats [New Study Shows How the Mainstream Media Pushes the Democratic Party Agenda](https://explainamerica.com/2962998/). This story comes from Kyle Becker, who has a history of publishing misinformation on his website [Becker News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/becker-news/). However, when it comes to sourcing, they generally use credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/).
Explain America generally publishes highly right-biased opinion content; however, most stories are rooted in fact and earn a mostly factual rating due to offering corrections to stories that are not accurate such as this
[CORRECTION: PayPal Did Not Put $2,500 Fines on Users Back Into Its Terms of Service](https://explainamerica.com/2662909/).
