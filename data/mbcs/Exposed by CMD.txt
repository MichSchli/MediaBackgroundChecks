History
Exposed by CMD, a website operated by the
[Center for Media and Democracy (CMD)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-media-and-democracy/), is recognized for its in-depth investigations into corruption affecting democracy, the environment, and economic prosperity. Founded in 1993, CMD is led by Executive Director Arn Pearson, with Lisa Graves as the board President. CMD manages this website and [SourceWatch.org](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/). [Some contend](http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/125510523.html) that CMD is not neutral. CMD has been criticized for having an anti-corporate viewpoint.

Funded by / Ownership
The Center for Media and Democracy owns and publishes Exposed by CMD, which is a nonprofit funded through donations. They claim on their
[about page](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/about-cmd/) that “We accept no funding from for-profit corporations or grants from administrative agencies.” However, they [list](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/about-cmd/) funding from numerous left-leaning foundations such as [Open Society Foundations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/open-society-foundations/), Ford Foundation, and Tides Foundation.
Analysis / Bias
The Exposed by CMD website covers news and conducts investigations with a strong left-leaning bias. Headlines and articles contain loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Constitution in the Crosshairs: The Far Right’s Plan for a New Confederacy](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2023/12/12/constitution-in-the-crosshairs-the-far-rights-plan-for-a-new-confederacy/). This story, like all others reviewed, relies on credible sources such as [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), [Ballotpedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ballotpedia/), [The Progressive](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-progressive/), and .gov sites.
Editorially, story selection and opinion pieces often favor
[workers’ rights](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2024/01/03/first-avenue-workers-victory-another-win-for-union-and-worker-center-collaborations/) and [fighting climate change](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2022/11/07/dispatches-from-the-cop27-climate-talks-in-egypt/), which aligns with progressive left viewpoints. However, many of the investigations conducted by the CMD focus on money spent by right-wing groups and initiatives like this: [DonorsTrust Funneled $134 Million to Right-Wing Groups in 2022](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2023/11/17/donorstrust-funneled-134-million-to-right-wing-groups-in-2022/). Again, this information is well sourced from the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), [SourceWatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), and IRS filings. In general, Exposed by CMD holds progressive biases and adheres to fact-based reporting.
