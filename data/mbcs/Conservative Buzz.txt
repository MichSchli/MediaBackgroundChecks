Analysis / Bias
In review, Conservative Buzz does not produce original content. Rather, they republish or summarize articles from other sources and place them in categories such as: Latest News, Elections, Big Government and Liberal Lunacy. Headlines are not overly sensational and generally reflect the story such as this:
[U.S. Receives Wave Of Bomb Threats.](https://conservativebuzz.com/2018/12/13/u-s-receives-wave-of-bomb-threats/) However, this story, like most on the website do not provide hyperlinked sourcing, but rather mention the source where it came from. Some of the sources used are the Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and credible [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/). In general, story selection always favors the right.
