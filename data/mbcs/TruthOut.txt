Analysis / Bias
In review, Truthout is a progressive news and opinion website focused on social justice and the environment. There is significant use of loaded emotional language that favors the left such as this:
[Scapegoating Unions for the Postal Service’s Phony Crisis](https://truthout.org/articles/scapegoating-unions-for-the-postal-services-phony-crisis/). This op-ed is properly sourced to credible outlets such as [Brookings](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/) and whitehouse.gov. Straight news reporting comes from both Truthout staff, as well as republishing from other sources. Most of the sources used for republishing are left-leaning such as [Common Dreams](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/common-dreams/), [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/), and [Rewire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rewire/). In general, story selection always favors the left with negative reporting on President Trump, such as this: [Donald Trump’s Only Strategy Is to Create Crisis and Claim to Fix It](https://truthout.org/articles/donald-trumps-only-strategy-is-to-create-crisis-and-claim-to-fix-it/).
When it comes to science, Truthout holds a
[negative view toward GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) and uses highly sensationalized and conspiratorial headlines such as this: [Have Monsanto, and the Biotech Industry Turned Natural Pesticides Into GMO “Super Toxins”?](https://truthout.org/articles/have-monsanto-and-the-biotech-industry-turned-natural-bt-pesticides-into-gmo-super-toxins/)
Failed Fact Checks
Although Truthout has not failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker, they have reported some stories that were not factual. For example, a reporter claimed that Karl Rove was indicted on charges when in fact, he wasn’t. The reporter continued to claim without evidence. See the link
