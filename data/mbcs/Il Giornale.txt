[Italy 58/180](https://rsf.org/en/italy) in their Press Freedom Index. [Read our profile on Italy’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/italy-media-profile/) Currently, the Prime Minister of Italy is Mario Draghi, who leans [center-left](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/italy-pm-conte-left-leaning-coalition-vote-of-confidence) due to a coalition government.
In review, Il Giornale publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as
[“The center-right united in the square: “We give voice to Italy forgotten by the government.”](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/centrodestra-unito-piazza-diamo-voce-allitalia-dimenticata-1864117.html) This article is sourced through quotes and tweets. Although Il Giornale sometimes provides a [hyperlink](http://blog.ilgiornale.it/locati/2020/05/17/oltre-il-covid-19-troppe-morti-inspiegabili/) to credible sources such as [The BMJ (British Medical Journal)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-bmj-british-medical-journal/), they typically source through large blocks of quotes.
Further, most of Il Giornale’s editorials criticize the former Conte Government, such as this:
[“So only the mafias celebrate](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/cos-festeggiano-soltanto-mafie-1863744.html).” The editor criticizes the former Prime Minister by stating, “The problem is that Conte relied on professors instead of entrepreneurs.” In the Il Giornale section called “Insideover,” they publish articles with emotionally loaded language such as [“Turkey Makes Another Risky Move in the Eastern Mediterranean.”](https://www.insideover.com/politics/turkey-makes-another-risky-move-in-the-eastern-mediterranean.html) This article is poorly sourced through quotes from analysts; however, there is not a hyperlink or the name of the analysts. A quote from the article reads, “Expected Turkish drilling in the region will widen the scope of tension in it and put Ankara on a collision course with other countries, analysts said.” In general, they hold a right-leaning editorial bias and source information poorly.
