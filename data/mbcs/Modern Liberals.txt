Analysis / Bias
In review, Modern Liberals (ML) publishes both strongly left-leaning news commentary and political satire. ML appropriately labels and separates this content. For this review we will only examine news commentary. The articles reviewed all contain strongly loaded emotional words that favor the left, such as this:
[Sarah Huckabee Sanders Says Roger Stone Has Nothing To Do With Trump And These Pictures Say She’s A Liar](http://www.modernliberals.com/sarah-huckabee-sanders-says-roger-stone-has-nothing-to-do-with-trump-and-these-pictures-say-shes-a-liar/). In another article, there is the use of profanity in the headline: [Pelosi Politely Tells Trump He Can F*ck Himself And Deliver The State Of The Union Somewhere Else](http://www.modernliberals.com/pelosi-state-union-2019/). Most of the articles reviewed were sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) or documents and tweets from political figures. In general, Modern Liberals is a fiercely anti-Trump website.
