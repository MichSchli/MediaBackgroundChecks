Analysis / Bias
In review, the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin publishes local news via journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Truck driver is charged with 5 deaths in wreck on 10 Freeway last year in Rialto; pleads not guilty](https://www.dailybulletin.com/2019/02/19/truck-driver-is-charged-with-5-deaths-in-i-10-wreck-last-year-in-rialto-pleads-not-guilty/?fbclid=iwar0l_ftbo6rxz99qpwbqvegdnldji-qkfzhsva_f7dpviovrdavxwaol-to). The national news is republished from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Political news coverage tends to lean left with stories such as these: [Female presidential candidates likely to face bias based on gender, study shows](https://www.dailybulletin.com/2019/02/22/study-indicates-female-presidential-candidates-likely-to-face-bias-based-on-leadership-looks-more/), and [Emergency?

Editorially there is a mix of left and right-leaning opinions with a slight advantage to the right. In general, the Daily Bulletin reports news with balance and is properly sourced.
