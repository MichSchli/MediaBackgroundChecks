Analysis / Bias
In review, Constative.com covers clickbait-style news such as
[“British Habits Americans Will Never Understand.”](https://constative.com/world/british-habits-americans-will-never-understand/) Under the news section, they typically cover travel information with minimal bias, such as this [“Current Hawaii Vacation Travel Restrictions and Rules.”](https://constative.com/news/current-hawaii-vacation-travel-restrictions-and-rules/) Headlines typically reflect the content of articles; however, information is poorly sourced. For example, they report on the restrictions in place; however, no sources are used or hyperlinks for reference.
Editorially, Constative.com does not directly cover politics; however, they publish entertainment news as it relates to politics. For example, under this listicle
[“27 Famous People Who Said Really Dumb Things,”](https://constative.com/celebrity/famous-people-who-said-really-dumb-things/9/) they quote President Biden, “If we do everything right if we do it with absolute certainty, there’s still a 30% chance we’re going to get it wrong.” In this case, they appropriately link to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). Another example, under a listicle titled [“25 Facts About Trump Tower You Never Knew,”](https://constative.com/business/25-facts-trump-tower-facts/16/) they use various facts about Trump Tower. To read all the information, you have to click forward to the next page 25 times; hence this is a clickbait website. A thorough review of political content demonstrates a more negative tone toward left-leaning politicians.
