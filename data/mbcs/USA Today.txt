Analysis
USA Today had never taken a position in a US presidential election. However, in 2016, USA Today published an
[editorial](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/dont-vote-for-donald-trump-editorial-board-editorials-debates/91295020/) urging readers not to vote for Donald Trump. Further, they did not endorse Hillary Clinton either. USA Today explained its decision behind the “disendorsement” in a separate editorial titled: [“Why we’re breaking tradition: Our view,”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/donald-trump-editorial-board-al-neuharth-editorials-debates/91294382/) in which they explain that founder Al Neuharth in his [column](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-05-31/mitt-romney-donald-trump-fundraiser/55319192/1), described Trump in 2012 as “a clown who loves doing or saying things to get attention, no matter how ridiculous.” Essentially, they felt that this is what Al Neuharth would have wanted if he were alive. Although they did not endorse any single candidate, they opposed Donald Trump.
In 2017, a USA Today editorial published a rebuke of a Trump tweet: “
[Will Trump’s lows ever hit rock bottom?”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/12/12/trump-lows-ever-hit-rock-bottom-editorials-debates/945947001/)
“Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!” ~ Donald Trump
The USA Today Editorial Board responded by writing: “A president who’d all but call a senator a whore is unfit to clean toilets in Obama’s presidential library or shine George W. Bush’s shoes.” When USA Today received criticism for this editorial’s perceived bias, they responded with an
[additional editorial](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/12/13/response-concerns-editorial-trump-gillibrand/948317001/) explaining their position.
Bias
In review, USA Today publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“President Trump’s 2017 performance review, from Putin with love.”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/01/17/president-trumps-2017-performance-review-putin-love-steven-strauss-column/1032913001/) USA Today also publishes opposite-view articles such as [“Democrats, it’s time for you to dump Hillary Clinton.”](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/16/democrats-its-time-you-dump-hillary-clinton-christian-schneider-column/430158002/) USA Today [states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/01/26/why-does-usa-today-pair-editorials-opposing-views/1059433001/) they pair editorials with opposing views; however, we found more editorials slightly favored the left through wording and story selection in our review.
In June of 2018, to provide balance to readers, USA Today
[launched a conservative newsletter](https://www.poynter.org/news/usa-today-network-launches-conservative-opinion-newsletter-heartland) geared toward the United States’ heartland.
When it comes to reporting straight news, USA Today always uses proper sources such as
[Associated Press,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and [ABC News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) Further, straight news reporting is written with minimally loaded words and tends to cover both sides of issues.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/usa-today/) found that 41% of USA Today’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 32% Mixed, and 27% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers them. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 43% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 31% do not, ranking them #9 in trust of the major USA news providers.
