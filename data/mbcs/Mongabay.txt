Analysis / Bias
In review, Mongabay publishes news and research related to the environment and conservation. Their
[mission](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/45-3714703) is to “raise awareness about social and environmental issues relating to tropical forests and other ecosystems, to wildlife, and to the important role that natural ecosystems play in maintaining critical services, including stabilizing the global climate system. To achieve this, Mongabay.org creates educational materials in several languages and provides opportunities for science journalists to report on environmental issues through well-established online platforms.”
Articles and headlines sometimes utilize loaded emotional language such as this
[The thick of it: Delving into the neglected global impacts of human waste](https://news.mongabay.com/2022/01/the-thick-of-it-delving-into-the-neglected-global-impacts-of-human-waste/). All information is properly sourced to credible outlets such as scientific journals, [WHO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), and Columbia University. Editorially, they lean left with their support for conservation and concern for the environment.
