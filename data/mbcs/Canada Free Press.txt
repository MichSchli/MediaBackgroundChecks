Analysis / Bias
Canada Free Press is an overtly Christian, extreme right website that peddles conspiracy theories such as
[Obama being an Islamic Terrorist](https://canadafreepress.com/article/obamas-ineligibility-prepare-to-defend-america-muslim-leftist-radical-in-th) and [9/11 as an inside job](http://web.archive.org/web/20050808081842/http://www.canadafreepress.com/2005/cover071105.htm). They also promote pseudosciences such as [human-influenced](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) [Climate Change Denial](https://canadafreepress.com/article/end-climate-propaganda) and [Creationism](https://canadafreepress.com/article/a-misguided-faith-in-evolution).
Canada Free Press routinely uses strong loaded wording that always favors the right such as this:
[New Poll Results Freaking out Democrats.](https://canadafreepress.com/article/new-poll-results-freaking-out-democrats) When it comes to sourcing, they favor right-biased sources and occasionally use sources that we have rated as Questionable.
