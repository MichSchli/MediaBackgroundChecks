Analysis / Bias
In review, New Matilda is a hybrid website that produces real news as well as satire. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded language that favors the left such as this
[Trump’s Loss Leaves ScoMo Out In The Cold In A Warming World](https://newmatilda.com/2020/11/14/crossing-the-green-divide-trumps-loss-leaves-scomo-out-in-the-cold/) and this [What Australia’s COVID-19 Panic-Buying Tells Us About Climate Change](https://newmatilda.com/2020/06/08/what-australias-covid-19-panic-buying-tells-us-about-climate-change/).
Editorially, they align with the progressive left in their defense of Julian Assange such as this
[Julian Assange Must Be Freed, Not Betrayed: John Pilger](https://newmatilda.com/2020/02/18/julian-assange-must-be-freed-not-betrayed-john-pilger/) and with [Timeline Of A Capitulation: How Morrison Finally Conceded Climate Change Makes Bushfires Worse](https://newmatilda.com/2020/01/13/timeline-of-a-capitulation-how-morrison-finally-conceded-climate-change-makes-bushfires-worse/). In general, the New Matilda covers news with a strong left-leaning bias in story selection but is well-sourced.
