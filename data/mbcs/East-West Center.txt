Analysis / Bias
The East-West Center focuses on research and discussions related to various social and global topics.
The article titled
[Beyond Binary: New Approaches to Gender in Southeast Asia](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/events/beyond-binary-new-approaches-gender-southeast-asia) reflects a progressive or left-leaning viewpoint on gender issues. By delving into the gender dynamics in Southeast Asia and acknowledging a broader “gender spectrum,” the lecture challenges traditional norms and advocates for a more inclusive understanding of gender.
On the other hand, the article
[Two Peripheries: The Ukraine War’s Effect on North Korea-Russia Relations](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/two-peripheries-ukraine-wars-effect-north-korea-russia-relations) offers a balanced view of the geopolitical implications of [Russia’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) actions in [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/) on the Korean Peninsula, presenting facts and analysis without overt bias. However, the article does not provide direct citations or references within the text. Instead, it offers a comprehensive analysis based on the author’s understanding and interpretation of the geopolitical situation. The lack of direct citations might raise questions about the sources of specific claims or information in the article.
Lastly, The article
[“Pacific Islands Young Economic Empowerment Leaders Cohort 2”](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/training-exchanges/pacific-islands-young-economic-empowerment-leaders-cohort-2) cites the “Pacific Islands Development Program” as a source, indicating that the Center does include references in some of its content for verification and further exploration.
In general, while the East-West Center prioritizes in-depth research and dialogue on critical issues and presents content without evident bias, certain topics, such as those related to gender, align with progressive or left-leaning perspectives.
