Analysis / Bias
In review, Vigilant Citizen publishes right-wing conspiracy theories about symbolism and other topics. For example, in the story
[Kevin Spacey Posted a Chilling Video on YouTube One Day Before the Sudden Death of His Accuser](https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/kevin-spacey-posted-a-chilling-video-on-youtube-one-day-before-the-sudden-death-of-his-accuser/), they claim there is a hidden message in the video that links Kevin Spacey to the deaths of three people who have been accused him of misconduct. This story is only sourced from a video with speculation added by Vigilant Citizen. They also promote without evidence that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, such as this: [Was Jeffrey Epstein Murdered?](https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/was-jeffrey-epstein-murdered/) While it may or may not be true that he was murdered, there isn’t evidence to suggest he was.
Finally, Vigilant Citizen holds a favorable view of former President Trump as they are concerned with witches casting spells on him
[Witches Worldwide Target Trump in Mass Occult Ritual](https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/witches-worldwide-target-trump-mass-occult-ritual/). This is a tinfoil hat-level conspiracy website that often promotes debunked or impossible-to-prove claims.
