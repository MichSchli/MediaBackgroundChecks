History
According to
[Whois,](http://whois.domaintools.com/thinkamericana.com) the domain was purchased in 2017. Think Americana does not have an about page, disclaimer, or ownership information. Further, the only author listed on the website is Mike Vance. This appears to be a one-person blog promoting conservative news.
Funded by / Ownership
Again, Think Americana does not offer transparency, therefore ownership is unknown, though Mike Vance does make every post on this website. The website appears to be funded by only advertising, but we cannot be 100% sure on sponsors and donations as there is zero disclosure.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Think Americana is far-right website that glorifies President Trump and denigrates liberals through loaded language such as this:
[ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ PRETENDS TO BE FROM THE BRONX, HEREâ€™S PROOF SHE WENT TO AFFLUENT YORKTOWN. ](https://thinkamericana.com/2019/01/03/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-pretends-to-be-from-the-bronx-heres-proof-she-went-to-affluent-yorktown/) This story relies on the Questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) for information. The website breaks news into categories such as [Hillary](https://thinkamericana.com/category/hillary/) which is links to stories that denigrate Hillary Clinton and liberals in general. They also have a category for [Trump](https://thinkamericana.com/category/hillary/https://thinkamericana.com/category/trump/) that glorifies his policies and actions. Think Americana also has a Blogroll that presumably lists their 4 favorite sources which are the Questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), the factually Mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), The Last Tradition and Trump Truck. In general, all stories favor the right and some use very poor sources.
