Analysis / Bias
[RealClearInvestigations](http://observer.com/2016/10/realclearinvestigations-wants-to-be-the-medias-aggregator-and-ombudsman/) reports and links to news from other outlets and also produces its own original stories.
In review, RealClearInvestigations frequently uses emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[“2016 Trump Tower Meeting Looks Increasingly Like a Setup by Russian and Clinton Operatives”](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2018/08/13/trump_tower_meeting_looks_increasingly_like_a_setup.html) and [“Mueller Still Relying on Discredited Steele Dossier.”](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2018/02/20/robert_mueller_continues_using_the_steele_dossier.html)
Generally, story selection moderately favors the Right and RealClearInvestigations takes a Pro-Trump stance. RealClearInvestigations typically sources their information to credible sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/); however, they also source factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). For example, this snippet from the article: “Investigation worked with employees of Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research firm reportedly [paid $1 million](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/14/obamas-2012-campaign-hired-fusion-gps-to-dig-dirt-on-mitt-romney-book-claims.html) (Fox News link) by Clinton operatives to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign.” RealClearInvestigations sourced Fox News, who in turn sourced the [same information](http://dailycaller.com/2018/03/13/fusion-gps-romney-investigation/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social) from another factually mixed source, the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), owned by conservative political commentator [Tucker Carlson.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson)
