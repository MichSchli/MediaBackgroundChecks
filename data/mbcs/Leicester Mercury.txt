Analysis / Bias
In review, The Leicester Mercury covers local and regional news through journalists. News headlines are somewhat sensational such as this:
[Crooks with heavy-duty equipment mount late-night cash machine raid in Loughborough](https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/local-news/crooks-heavy-duty-equipment-mount-3509199). This story is properly sourced. The website breaks news down into several categories, including politics. Political news tends to slightly favor the right such as this: [Labour Party remains silent over suspended Keith Vaz](https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/labour-party-remains-silent-over-3500079). However, a review of general news reporting and op-eds finds a relatively balanced approach. On a whole, the Leicester Mercury leans slightly right through story selection.
