History
The Florida Capital Star is a news and opinion website with a right-leaning bias in reporting. According to their
[about page](https://floridacapitalstar.com/about-us-fl/), “We feature articles reporting news, politics, and policy at the state level, primarily from Florida. We round out our daily coverage with national stories and thoughtful commentary of interest to our readers.” According to an investigation by [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/03/04/activists-setup-local-news-sites/), The Florida Capital Star is not a local newspaper but rather a front for “Tea Party-connected conservative activists: Michael Patrick Leahy and Christina Botteri.” Snopes details connections to conservative donors and PACS as well.

Editorially, the Florida Capital Star has a strong right-leaning bias with frequent use of strong, emotionally loaded words that favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this

Although The Florida Capital Star is right-biased and generally factual, we cannot rate them High for factual reporting due to the source being exposed as a political activism website attempting to look like a local paper. For this reason, we rate them factually Mixed based on a lack of transparency and the promotion of propaganda.
