Analysis / Bias
In review, the
[print edition](https://washingtonspectator.org/about/) of the Washington Spectator, generally in “every issue covers a single topic—most often, one that its editors believe is not receiving sufficient coverage in the mainstream media outlets.” The website publishes articles related to politics, the world, culture, and the economy. Articles and headlines utilize strongly loaded language that favors a left-leaning perspective, such as this [Anatomy of Deceit: Team Trump Deploys Doctors with Dubious Qualifications to Push Fake Cure for Covid-19](https://washingtonspectator.org/anatomy-of-deceit/). This story, like most, is thoroughly sourced from credible media outlets such as [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/).
Editorially, The Washington Spectator promotes left-leaning policies such as environmentalism and supports the consensus of science regarding
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), [Event: Mobilizing to Defeat Climate Change](https://washingtonspectator.org/event-mobilizing-to-defeat-climate-change/). Other policies supported are [LGBTQ rights](https://washingtonspectator.org/gay-revolution/), [Black Lives Matter](https://washingtonspectator.org/white-america-this-ones-on-you/), and negative reporting on [conservatives](https://washingtonspectator.org/aei-conservative-republican-doublespeak/) and former [President Donald Trump](https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-tax-cuts-for-wealthy-pressman/). They generally report the news factually and with a consistent left-leaning bias.
