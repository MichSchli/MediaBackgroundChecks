History
Donaldjtrump.com was the official campaign
[website](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0016078/) of former Republican President Donald J. Trump, which featured upcoming campaign events, a donation section, and other standard campaign sections. After losing the 2020 Presidential election, the website became a forum for Donald Trump to issue official statements and, most recently, a blog called [From the Desk of Donald J. Trump](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/desk).
After the Capitol Riots on January 6th, Twitter eventually suspended Donald Trump from his primary communication vehicle and Facebook. As a result, he began issuing statements on his website and recently From the Desk of Donald J. Trump. A Twitter account was created for From the Desk but was promptly
[suspended](https://twitter.com/djtdesk) by Twitter. [On June 2, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/trump-blog-page-shuts-down-for-good.html?utm_content=Politics&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1622642731), From the Desk of Donald Trump was removed from the website. However, his statements are still listed on the donaldjtrump.com domain. [Read our profile on USA Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Formerly,Donaldjtrump.com featured the sections “News” and “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.” Under the News section, all news posts are titled “
[Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-05.10.21)” The same statement is published on his From the Desk blog. The only difference between them is the title and the fact that the blog posts can be shared on Twitter and Facebook.
The content published is similar to Donald Trump’s previous Twitter account, where he criticizes his opponents and media. The blog posts also frequently promote false claims and conspiracy theories. For example, on May 7, 2021, he
[repeated](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/desk/desk-sv5wzzsjev/) a debunked election fraud claim such as this “At 6:31 in the morning on November 4th, a dump of 149,772 votes came into the State of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes, and the State miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate started their review of the Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 yet, or are they about to start?” This statement has been [fact-checked](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-checking-donald-trumps-latest) by the right-leaning IFCN fact-checker, [The Dispatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-dispatch/), and failed.
The
[wording](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/desk/desk-hgnfasttbf/) of Former President Trump’s blog entries are highly emotional and unchanged from his days on Twitter “The Fake News Media, working in close conjunction with Big Tech and the Radical Left Democrats, is doing everything they can to perpetuate the term “The Big Lie” when speaking of 2020 Presidential Election Fraud. They are right in that the 2020 Presidential Election was a Big Lie, but not in the way they mean.” In general, From the Desk of Donald J. Trump promotes a far-right biased agenda and regularly publishes false or misleading information.
