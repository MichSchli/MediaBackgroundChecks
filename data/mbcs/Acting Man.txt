Analysis / Bias
In review, Acting Man is a blog focused on libertarian and Austrian Economics. Most headlines have minimal loaded words, but several articles do, for example, in the article
[Trump Vs. The Deep State](http://www.acting-man.com/?p=48819#more-48819) refers to the Obama Administration as the “Obummer Administration,” an old childish term for those who oppose the former President. This instantly diminishes the credibility of the source. Further, in this same article, the only source listed as a reference is [Zero Hedge](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), which we have rated as a conspiracy website.
Editorially, most stories favor the right. In general, this is a low-credibility blog that favors the right.
