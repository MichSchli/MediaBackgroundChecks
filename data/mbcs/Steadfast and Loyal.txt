Analysis / Bias
Steadfast and Loyal is an opinion and news website with a strong right-wing bias in reporting. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional language such as
[“LIBERALS LATEST CHICKEN LITTLE WARNING FAILS TO MATERIALIZE](https://steadfastandloyal.com/politics/liberals-latest-chicken-little-warning-fails-materialize/).” Although they utilize credible right-wing sources such as [The American Spectator,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-spectator/) they also use factually mixed sources such as [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and questionable sources like [Allen West Republic.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/allen-west-republic/) Example: “ [THE DEEP STATE IS COMING UNGLUED RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES](https://steadfastandloyal.com/social-issues/deep-state-coming-unglued-right-eyes/).” Further, Steadfast and Loyal made a false claim according to Snopes: [“Vigilante Protesters Digging Up Confederate Graves after Charlottesville Clashes?”](https://www.snopes.com/are-vigilante-protesters-digging-up-confederate-graves/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right such as this
[BUTTIGIEG MAKES INSANE STATEMENT ABOUT ELECTRIC CARS](https://steadfastandloyal.com/news-for-you/buttigieg-makes-insane-statement-about-electric-cars/). When covering Covid-19, they take the conservative positions of no lockdowns or mask/vaccine mandates but do not make false claims regarding the virus or vaccines. Though it is safe to say they downplay it. In general, they publish mixed factual content that is hyper-partisan in favor of the far right.
