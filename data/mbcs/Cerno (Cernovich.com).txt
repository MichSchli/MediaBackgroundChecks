Mike Cernovich, according to his interview with the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/31/trolls-for-trump) is an “expert at using social media to drive alt-right ideas into the heart of American political discourse” and he prefers to call himself “American nationalist,” but he often uses “we” when discussing the alt-right movement” Mike Cernovich has also been mentioned by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) as an [important figure](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/06/21/competing-alt-right-free-speech-rallies-reveal-infighting-over-white-nationalism) in the Alt-Right movement.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Cerno publishes articles with sensational headlines and sometimes uses videos to promote propaganda by using loaded language:“
[EXCLUSIVE: Man Featured In Viral Video Getting His MAGA Hat Stolen By A Snowflake Is Pursuing Legal Action](http://cernovich.com/exclusive-man-featured-viral-video-getting-maga-hat-stolen-snowflake-pursuing-legal-action/)”. However, occasionally Cerno quotes credible sources such as the [Miami Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/miami-herald/), but again with sensational headlines: “ [Socialism Sucks: Venezuelan Female Teachers and Doctors Turn to Prostitution to Survive.](http://cernovich.com/socialism-sucks-venezuelan-female-teachers-doctors-turn-prostitution-survive/)” Mike Cernovich has been credited with a [Pants on Fire](http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/jul/18/mike-cernovich/no-cleveland-police-are-not-standing-down-rnc/) claim via [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact-news/) as well as being labeled a [male supremacist](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/mike-cernovich). In short, this is an Alt-Right website.
