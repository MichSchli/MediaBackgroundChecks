[According](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/peter-g-peterson-foundation/recipients?toprecipscycle=2020&id=D000070397&candscycle=2020) to [Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/) they generally fund both Democrats and Republicans. For example, in 2016 they contributed 50% to Republicans, 49% to Democrats, and 1% to others. However, in 2020 they contributed 85% to Democrats.
Analysis / Bias
In review, they stick to reporting facts and figures with opinion pieces mixed in on occasion. They have donated to Clinton, Bush, Heritage fund, and several left-leaning organizations making them very moderate in their views. There’s little extremism as they talk of carbon tax & fair tax taking from
[both sides of the aisle](http://www.pgpf.org/finding-solutions/tax-reform). They have an array of speakers from Bill Clinton to Alan Greenspan to Chris Christie demonstrating a bipartisan and moderate approach to fiscal policy and taxation. PETER G. PETERSON, for who the foundation is named after, served under Nixon and Clinton. According to [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/) he has been quoted as saying; “I remain a Republican, but the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party, not troubling with evidence.” In general, the Peterson Foundation provides factual analysis that is bipartisan and low-biased.
