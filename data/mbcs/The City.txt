Analysis / Bias
In review, The City has a partnership with New York Media, in which their stories are published on the
[New York Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-magazine/) website. The City provides original reporting ranging from local first person accounting to in-depth investigations covering lifestyle and politics.
The City typically does not use loaded emotional language in articles and headlines such as this:
[Trained Operators for Coronavirus Patient Ventilators Scarce in New York](https://thecity.nyc/2020/03/trained-operators-for-coronavirus-ventilators-scarce-in-nys.html). This story, like most, is correctly sourced to credible outlets such as NYC.gov and the State Department of Education. Story selection tends to lean left with many articles covering social justice and education. Generally, the news is reported factually with a slight left-leaning bias in story selection.
