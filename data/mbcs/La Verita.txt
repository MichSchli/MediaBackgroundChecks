Analysis / Bias
La Verità demonstrates a conservative bias, particularly in its critiques of Western leaders and environmental policies, as seen in “
[Green, weapons, hoaxes: the ‘competent’ treat us like foolish children.”](https://www.laverita.info/green-armi-bufale-i-competenti-ci-trattano-come-bambini-sciocchi-2667344394.html) This article uses strong emotive language to suggest that authorities manipulate public opinion through fear, reflecting a common right-leaning perspective that questions mainstream environmental policies and leadership decisions. The publication’s selective sourcing further reinforces its conservative viewpoint, shaping reader perceptions to be skeptical of established authorities and environmental initiatives, appealing to those already doubting mainstream narratives.
Further, the editorial by Maurizio Belpietro, titled
[“Here’s Who Is Plotting Against Meloni,”](https://www.laverita.info/ecco-chi-trama-contro-meloni-2666882598.html) takes a stance in favor of Prime Minister [Giorgia Meloni.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/giorgia-meloni-italy-facts-and-bias/) The piece suggests that political figures, notably Giuliano Amato, may be working against her. The author supports Meloni, describing her as resilient amid political adversity, which reflects a clear editorial bias in her favor.
Transitioning to coverage on LGBTQ+ topics, La Verità’s articles “
[Drugs for children to change sex. The increasing cases are now scary](https://www.laverita.info/farmaci-bimbi-cambiare-sesso-2667170488.html)” and “ [Free drugs for trans people: we pay ](https://www.laverita.info/farmaci-gratis-ai-trans-per-cambiare-sesso-2647884532.html)“have been criticized for fear-mongering and potential misinformation by outlets like [Gay.it](https://www.gay.it/la-verita-titolo-disgustoso-in-prima-pagina-farmaci-gratis-ai-trans-paghiamo-noi) and [Quotidiano Sanità.](https://www.quotidianosanita.it/scienza-e-farmaci/articolo.php?articolo_id=119868#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLa%20triptorelina%2C%20un%20bloccante%20transitorio,orientamento%20e%20identit%C3%A0%20sessuale%2C%20ma) Further, La Verità has routinely published false and misleading information about [Covid-19 and its associated vaccines](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/laverita.info?cid=9aff6a82-bdbe-4c6d-b65c-67bd6f23c098).
In summary, La Verità’s editorial stance and reporting style are characterized by a right-leaning bias and a tendency towards sensationalism and the publication of misinformation.
