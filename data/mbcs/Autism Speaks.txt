History
Autism Speaks is an autism advocacy organization in the United States that sponsors autism research and conducts awareness and outreach activities aimed at families, governments, and the public. Autism Speaks is an organization that raises
[tens of millions of dollars](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0824-silberman-autism-speaks-20150824-story.html) each year by hosting walks and star-studded events like an annual concert in Hollywood called Light Up the Blues. While Autism Speaks is one of the largest and most influential Autism groups, they are not without controversy.
Until recently, they promoted
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) based on the false notion that vax is a risk factor for [autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). This goes 100% against the [consensus of science](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0824-silberman-autism-speaks-20150824-story.html). Thankfully, they have changed their position, [stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#cite_note-55): they “have not found a link between vaccines and autism,” and that they “strongly encourage parents to have their children vaccinated for protection against serious disease.” Another significant controversy is the board of Autism Speaks does not have a single person with autism representing the organization. This has caused persons with autism to form counter groups and protest this organization’s leadership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Autism Speaks publishes information on support for those with Autism as well as news. News is often low biased and evidence-based such as this
[Autism researcher presents findings on self-determination in planning for transition to adulthood](https://www.autismspeaks.org/science-news/autism-researcher-presents-findings-self-determination-planning-transition-adulthood). However, this organization sometimes promotes and funds [non-evidence-based](https://asatonline.org/research-treatment/resources/topical-articles/review-of-randomized-control-trial-of-dirfloortime-therapy-learning-through-interaction-in-children-with-autism-preliminary-data-from-a-social-communication-based-intervention/) therapies such as [Floortime](https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/treatment/floortime). Autism Speaks has a long record of promoting Pseudoscience but has changed its positions to be more evidence-based. In 2017 we rated Autism Speaks as a Strong promoter of Pseudoscience. With the changes they have made, we feel they are mildly promoting pseudoscience through advocacy for therapies that are not yet evidence-based.
