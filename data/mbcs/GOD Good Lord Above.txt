TheGoodLordAbove uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, prior to 2018, Good Lord Above was a website that published fake satirical news stories that made fun of religion and the Christian Right. In 2018, they began publishing real news stories that are also denigrating to the right. A sample article headline reads:
[This Hilarious New Twitter Account Combines The Pope With Filthy Tweets](https://thegoodlordabove.com/2018/10/08/pontifux-pope-horny-twitter-account-ddt/). Some articles use highly loaded emotional language such as this: [Scumbag Televangelist Pat Robertson Prays For God To ‘Throw Confusion’ Into Kavanaugh’s Alleged Victims.](https://thegoodlordabove.com/2018/09/29/pat-robertson-kavanaugh-prayer/) In general, articles typically reference tweets, with opinions that favor the left added in. Other articles consist of summaries from other sources such as: [Raw Story](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/raw-story/), [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), [Daily Dot](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-dot/), and the Friendly Atheist. Story selection always favors the left.
A
