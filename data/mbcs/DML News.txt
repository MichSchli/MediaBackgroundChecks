Analysis / Bias
TeamDML features a free news aggregation/curation service and paid subscription content consisting of live programming, podcasts, and educational products.
TeamDML’s news feed consists of an opening commentary (conservative-leaning) that is followed by a snippet of a summary from the source. Articles and headlines use emotionally loaded wording, such as this
[REPORT: Bombshell FBI report contradicts Alec Baldwin’s key claim about tragedy on set.](https://teamdml.com/news/report-bombshell-fbi-report-contradicts-alec-baldwins-key-claim-about-tragedy-on-set/?lpr=1) The DML News aggregator draws upon a mix of credible sources such as [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) and [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) and less reliable sources such as the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/) and [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/).
Editorially, story selection favors the right, while opinion content strongly supports former President Trump, such as this
[Trump has huge night, what it means for midterms](https://teamdml.com/news/dml-podcast-trump-has-huge-night-what-it-means-for-midterms-ep138/?lpr=1). Generally, aggregated news is mostly factual but sometimes relies on poor sources. Politically, DML News holds a right conservative bias.
