History
C19nitazoxanide.com is part of the CovidAnalysis Network, a group of websites that publishes research studies on alternative treatments for Covid-19. According to their
[FAQ page](https://c19early.com/faq.html), “We are Ph.D. researchers, scientists, people who hope to make a contribution, even if it is only very minor. You can find our research in journals like Science and Nature.”
Unfortunately, it is impossible to prove this as they lack transparency by not listing names, credentials, ownership, or funding.
They further state on the FAQ page, “We catalog
[544 potential treatments](https://c19early.com/treatments.html), of which we currently analyze 37 of the most effective, promising, and widely used early treatments. Many treatments are helpful for late-stage patients; however, we currently focus on early treatment.”
The
[domain](https://whois.domaintools.com/c19early.com) is registered in Canada, but we cannot determine where they are based due to a lack of transparency and restrictive privacy settings.
Finally, on
[December 27, 2020](https://c19early.com/twitter.html), Twitter suspended its account; as of this date, 2/21/2022, it remains suspended.
Funded by / Ownership
C19nitazoxanide.com is part of the
[CovidAnalysis Network](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/covidanalysis-network-c19early-com-bias/), lacking transparency as they do not disclose ownership. Further, they do not display advertising or solicit donations; therefore, it is unknown if they are funded by large corporate donors, alternative health providers/stores, or political activist groups.
Analysis
The CovidAnalysis Network consists of 29 websites, each with unique domain names. Each site is identical in that they publish studies related to an alternative treatment for Covid-19. They do not publish studies related to FDA-approved vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.
For all web domains such as C19nitazoxanide.com, they publish a summary of clinical trials or studies related to alternative treatments such as Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, Vitamin D, Zinc, etc. Within the summary, they indicate if the study is negative or inconclusive and explain the
[study’s faults](https://c19hcq.com/cavalcanti.html); however, when there is a positive result for an alternative treatment, they do not go into detail or [criticize the research](https://c19hcq.com/yu2.html) in the same manner. Data from the studies are compiled on meta-analysis pages for each treatment, with almost all alternative treatments having a favorable outcome in treating Covid, while those from peer-reviewed sources have poor or inconclusive outcomes.
Initially, the CovidAnalysis Network promoted Hydroxychloroquine as a beneficial treatment for Covid-19. At the time, they had a separate domain at HCQTrial.com that now redirects to
[hcqmeta.com](https://hcqmeta.com/). The meta page compiles and summarizes the data on HCQ as it relates to treatment for Covid, demonstrating a positive benefit in outcomes. However, there is no consensus on whether HCQ works in the treatment of Covid-19, with the [FDA revoking emergency use authorization](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-revokes-emergency-use-authorization-chloroquine-and) in June 2020.
Currently, the network promotes Ivermectin as a credible treatment.
[A recent study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2789362?guestAccessKey=58760460-df0f-4790-9257-8f3682dca39b&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=021822) published in the [Journal of the American Medical Association](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-medical-association-ama/) found, “In this open-label randomized clinical trial of high-risk patients with COVID-19 in Malaysia, a 5-day course of oral ivermectin administered during the first week of illness did not reduce the risk of developing severe disease compared with standard of care alone. The study findings do not support the use of ivermectin for patients with COVID-19.”
The AMA study above contradicts their meta-analysis found at
[ivmmeta.com](https://ivmmeta.com/), which claims Ivermectin is highly effective in treating Covid-19. They state, “Statistically significant improvements are seen for mortality, ventilation, ICU admission, hospitalization, recovery, cases, and viral clearance.” The results of their meta-analysis may be misleading due to the inclusion of non-peer-reviewed studies and the bias of the data interpreter.
Bias
C19nitazoxanide.com publishes studies related to Nitazoxanide (antiparasitic agent) and its efficacy in treating and preventing Covid-19. The website reports that Nitazoxanide showed statistically significant improvement with “Ventilation, Hospitalization, and Viral Clearance.”
[Other studies](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/nitazoxanide/) have demonstrated that Nitazoxanide has benefits against SARS-CoV-2.
While studies indicate Nitazoxanide may have some benefits The CovidAnalyisis Network generally promotes misinformation regarding alternative treatments for Covid-19 by cherry-picking and misrepresenting studies with favorable outcomes. In this way, they promote anti-vaccination propaganda without stating it for unknown reasons. Other sources have also reviewed the CovidAnalysis Network and have concluded that it promotes misinformation.
[See our full review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/covidanalysis-network-c19early-com-bias/).
C19nitazoxanide.com generally gives the impression of fairly publishing negative and positive studies; however, positive studies significantly outnumber negative, with many positive studies not being peer-reviewed and sometimes wholly misrepresented. This is a questionable, right-biased source that promotes pseudoscience and
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/).
