History
According to the Filming Cops
[About Page](http://filmingcops.com/about/), “they were started in 2010 as a conglomerative reporting service documenting police abuse. They state that “the aim isn’t to demonize the natural concept of security provision as such, but to highlight specific cases of State-monopolized police brutality that traditional media outlets otherwise ignore.” Although the about page sheds light on their mission, there isn’t transparency in authors, editors, or owners.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Filming Cops highlights police abuse and misconduct. Articles and headlines are often not sensational such as this

This story, like most, is not original and comes from another source. Many stories come from local media, which is usually credible. Regarding sourcing, they link to the original story at the end of the article.
Editorially, almost all stories portray the police in a negative light without offering countering stories where the police have helped. In general, they source to credible media sources, but they are completely one-sided, which renders them Mixed for factual reporting.
