Analysis / Bias
In review, Asia Sentinel uses emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Philippines’ Duterte’s Popularity Soars”](https://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-popularity-soars/) and [“Growing Disaster of Trump Administration’s Foreign Policy](https://www.asiasentinel.com/econ-business/growing-disaster-trump-administration-foreign-policy/).” When it comes to sourcing, some [articles](https://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/malaysia-gets-change-but-can-it-handle-it/) utilize credible sources such as “ [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/)” by mentioning “a Reuters interview of Anwar Ibrahim following his release from prison,” typically, however, Asia Sentinel poorly sources their articles and does not provide hyperlinks.
Further, Asia Sentinel published an
[article](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/09/20/dems-to-sue-asia-sentinel-despite-apology.html) in 2018 titled “Indonesia’s SBY Government: ‘Vast Criminal Conspiracy.’ This article was written by the site’s editor John Berthelsen, who claims that the former president of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), was involved in money laundering practices, which was called [“false”](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/09/15/yudhoyonos-party-to-sue-asia-sentinel-over-false-report.html) by [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY).](https://en.tempo.co/read/921841/i-forgive-asia-sentinel-sby-says)
Yudhoyono’s party stated that they would sue Asia Sentinel over a ‘false’ report. Later, an apology was published by Asia Sentinel’s website titled “
[Apology to President Yudhoyono and the Democrat Party of Indonesia,”](https://www.asiasentinel.com/press-release/apology-president-yudhoyono-democrat-party-indonesia/) and the original article was removed from the Asia Sentinel website.
