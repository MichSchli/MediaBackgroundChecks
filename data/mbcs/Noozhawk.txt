Analysis / Bias
Noozhawk covers news for Santa Barbara with minimal bias, such as this
[Santa Barbara County’s Population Grows 5.7% in 2020 Census](https://www.noozhawk.com/article/census_data_reveals_that_santa_barbara_countys_population_grew_by_nearly_6). This story, like most stories, links to credible sources.
Although they use words that are charged with emotion in some headlines/articles and with left bias such as these: “
[Arrogance and Ignorance: The Story of Mooch,”](https://www.noozhawk.com/article/susan_estrich_arrogance_and_ignorance_the_story_of_mooch) They do publish stories that are center-right too, such as Michael Barone (senior political analyst for [The Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/),) [“Anti-Trump Overreach Could Backfire”](https://www.noozhawk.com/article/michael_barone_anti_trump_overreach_could_backfire). Therefore, editorial bias is minimized through the balance of covering both sides. In general, news coverage is factual and contains minimal bias though slightly more favor the left, but not enough to change a least biased rating.
