History
Capital Research Center (CRC) is a non-profit, Libertarian “think tank” organization located in Washington, D.C. Capital Research Center was
[founded in 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Research_Center) by Willa Johnson. Before launching CRC, Johnson had been Senior Vice President of the [Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/), a conservative think tank with a [mixed record](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/09/heritage-foundation/heritage-foundation-tweet-says-repealing-obamacare/) reporting facts.
According to their
[ about page](https://capitalresearch.org/about/), “Today, we study unions, environmentalist groups, and many nonprofit and activist organizations. We also keep an eye on crony capitalists who seek to profit by taking advantage of government regulations and by getting their hands on taxpayers’ money.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Capital Research is a nonprofit organization that is funded through donations. The website lacks transparency as they do not list funding or donors. According to the left-leaning
[Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), they have received donations from the right-leaning Kochs, the [Scaifes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaife_Foundations), the [Bradleys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Foundation), and ExxonMobil.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Capital Research Center uses minimal loaded words and typically sources credible information. The one area where CRC reports questionable information is on the topic of climate change, where they reject the consensus of experts in the field. For example, this,
[A Cult of Climate Change?](https://capitalresearch.org/article/a-cult-of-climate-change/) This story is poorly sourced to the Questionable [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), [CARM.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-apologetics-research-ministry-carm/), and the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). Outside of a rejection of the consensus of science regarding climate change (see funding), they are mostly factual in other areas as long as it supports free-market economics.
Editorially, Capital Research generally favors the former
[Trump](https://capitalresearch.org/?s=trump) administration and rejects anything that is not pro-capitalism.
