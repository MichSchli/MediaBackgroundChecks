Analysis / Bias
In review, American Digital News frequently uses loaded language in its headlines and articles:
[Brennan & Co in Meltdown Mode over the FBI/DOJ Infiltration of the Trump Campaign](https://americandigitalnews.com/2018/05/21/brennan-meltdown-fbi-doj-infiltration-trump-campaign/#.WxPav0gvzb0). The website also openly endorses President Trump with a banner stating, “Make America Great Again.” For the most part, this is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website covering such topics as the [Seth Rich Murder](https://americandigitalnews.com/2018/03/04/let-us-not-forget-seth-rich-new-updates/#.WxPcPkgvzb0) Conspiracy, [Mind Control](https://americandigitalnews.com/2018/05/26/patents-details-mind-control-technology/#.WxPc0Egvzb0), [New World Order](https://americandigitalnews.com/2017/12/22/nwo-new-world-order-seen-legend-charlie-daniels/#.WxPdB0gvzb0), [False Flag Operations](https://americandigitalnews.com/?s=false+flag#.WxPdIEgvzb0), and [Antonin Scalia murdered by democrats to create a SCOTUS seat](https://americandigitalnews.com/?s=false+flag#.WxPdIEgvzb0).
