Analysis / Bias
Altermed Zentrum publishes a mixture of republished content and original. Most articles focus on alternative health and frequently promote pseudoscience such as this
[Studies show: Garlic helps against 14 types of cancer and 13 types of infections. Why don’t doctors recommend this?](https://altermedzentrum.com/studien-zeigen-knoblauch-hilft-gegen-14-arten-von-krebs-und-13-arten-von-infektionen-warum-empfehlen-aerzte-das-nicht/) The primary source for this story is [GreenMedInfo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/greenmedinfo/), which frequently promotes misleading pseudoscientific information. Doctors don’t recommend garlic because there is [little supportive evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366009/) to support its value in protecting against cancer.
The website frequently promotes anti-vaccination propaganda such as this
[Vaccinating: 27 Crushing Facts About The Pharmaceutical Industry And Its Vaccines !!](https://altermedzentrum.com/impfen-27-zerschmetternde-fakten-ueber-die-pharmaindustrie-und-ihre-impfstoffe/) They rely on poor sources such as [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), which routinely fails fact checks when promoting vaccine misinformation.
Altermed Zentrum also publishes debunked information regarding the dangers of 5G, such as this
[5G – Urgent warning of total radiation from new cellular network!](https://altermedzentrum.com/5g-dringende-warnung-vor-totalverstrahlung-durch-neues-mobilfunknetz-2/) Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have [repeatedly](https://altermedzentrum.com/?s=covid) reported false and misleading information. In general, they promote pseudoscientific information.
