Analysis / Bias
The
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) describes Agenda 21: The UN, Sustainability as a [“Right-Wing Conspiracy Theory”](https://www.splcenter.org/20140331/agenda-21-un-sustainability-and-right-wing-conspiracy-theory) and states Tom DeWeese “believes that Agenda 21 is ultimately responsible for what he sees as destructive forces in American society, including multiculturalism, same-sex marriage, and other cultural changes.” On the other hand, Tom DeWeese acknowledges that The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) calls his efforts an “Anti Government Right-Wing Conspiracy Theory.” He states, “Attack articles appeared in the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Esquire Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/esquire-magazine/), Wingnut Watch, [Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/), and [TreeHugger.com.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/treehugger/)” Further, Tom DeWeese suggests all these publications labeled his organization’ as ”tin-foil-hat-wearing nut jobs.” Unfortunately, we agree with the Washington Post, Esquire Magazine, Wingnut Watch, Mother Jones, and TreeHugger.com.
In review, American Policy Center (APC) publishes
[articles](https://americanpolicy.org/2019/02/25/green-new-deal-reveals-the-naked-truth-of-agenda-21/) with an extreme right-wing bias promoting conspiracy theories such as “Sustainable Development is not about the environmental clean up of rivers, air, and litter.” He calls them a “socialist scheme.” He also criticizes Libertarian and Conservative organizations such as “ [CATO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/), [Heritage](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/) and the [Reason Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/) for their support of Agenda 21.” In general, American Policy Center promotes the Agenda 21 conspiracy theory believing that globalists want to eliminate the human population by 85% and institute a one-world government. Despite railing against Agenda 21 for many years, it remains a non-binding agreement and is not likely to ever be ratified.
