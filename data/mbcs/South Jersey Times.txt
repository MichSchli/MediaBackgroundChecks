The South Jersey Times reports local news through reporters with minimal bias, such as this
[Nearly 8 years after N.J. man vanished, cops and family still looking for clues](https://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/2023/03/nearly-8-years-after-nj-man-vanished-cops-and-family-still-looking-for-clues.html). National/international news is covered via the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other Advance publications.
Editorially, The South Jersey Times does not publish opinion content online; however, story selection tends to slightly favor the left, such as this
[Hamilton school principal receives MLK community spirit award](https://www.nj.com/mercer/2023/01/hamilton-school-principal-receives-mlk-community-spirit-award.html). Generally, the news is factual and holds a slight left-leaning bias in story selection.
