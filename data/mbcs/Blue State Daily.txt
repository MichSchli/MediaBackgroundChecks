[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/bluestatedaily/about/?ref=page_internal) does have a description: “Blue State Daily is a 100% independent news website committed to keeping you informed of the latest democratic news.” A [Whois](http://whois.domaintools.com/bluestatedaily.com) search reveals the domain is registered privately and was purchased in 2016.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Blue State Daily is a 100% left leaning website that reports on Democratic news. Headlines and articles contain emotionally loaded words that typically favor the left such as this
[Hillary Clinton Blasts Trump And Republicans For Their Incivility.](https://bluestatedaily.com/hillary-clinton-blasts-trump-and-republicans-for-their-incivility/) Although most information is appropriately sourced, sometimes Blue State Daily utilizes poor sources with Mixed factual records such as [ShareBlue](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shareblue/). A review of the first 10 articles on the website demonstrate that every one of them is pro-left.
