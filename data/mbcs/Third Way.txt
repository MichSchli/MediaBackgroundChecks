History
Third Way is a Washington, D.C.-based public policy think tank
[founded in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way_(think_tank)). The think tank develops policy ideas, conducts public opinion research, and hosts issue briefings. The organization has four policy divisions: Economics, National Security, Clean Energy, and Social Policy & Politics. Third Way develops and advocates for policies representing the “vital center.” According to their [about page](https://www.thirdway.org/about), “Third Way is a national think tank that champions modern center-left ideas.

Funded by / Ownership
Third Way is a nonprofit that is funded through donations. However, the website lacks transparency as it does not disclose financial information or large donors. In 2019, the
[Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/13/koch-brothers-third-way/) reported that Koch Industries funded a report titled “Why Lou Dobbs is Winning.” In 2013, [The Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-nation/) [reported](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/gop-donors-and-k-street-fuel-third-ways-advice-democratic-party/), “The Democratic think tank Third Way relies on money from corporate interests, lobbyists, and Republican donors.” Finally, [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/) reports that [Third Way senior vice president admits majority of think tank’s funding comes from Wall Street](https://www.salon.com/2013/12/12/third_way_senior_vice_president_admits_majority_of_think_tanks_funding_comes_from_wall_street/).
Analysis / Bias
In review, Third Way publishes news and information from a neoliberal (free market) economic and socially liberal perspective. The website lists many issues and their positions, with curated links to outside news stories supporting their agenda. For example, under
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they support the consensus of science and list policy changes they advocate for, such as this “evidence-based solutions to the climate challenge that include advanced nuclear and carbon capture technology, as well as renewables, hydropower, existing nuclear, energy storage, and efficiency.” Under this heading, they list outside stories that come mostly from the Right-leaning [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), which also has a poor record with fact-checkers and [human-influenced climate denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).
Under the economy tag, they advocate for an “innovative, modernized government that must work in tandem with a thriving and dynamic private sector to achieve sustained economic growth and broad prosperity.” A press release under this tab shows they do not advocate for Republican tax policy such as this

Here is their perspective on some other issues:
When it comes to progressive Democratic politicians, they have a negative viewpoint such as this:
[How the Sanders Social Security Plan is Not Progressive](https://www.thirdway.org/report/how-the-sanders-social-security-plan-is-not-progressive). However, when reporting on Trump, they have a much stronger negative viewpoint [Untruthful Hyperbole: Trump vs. Facts on Jobs and the Economy](https://www.thirdway.org/memo/untruthful-hyperbole-trump-vs-facts-on-jobs-and-the-economy). Third Way generally endorses and supports a more favorable policy to the establishment, corporate-friendly Democrats but is nevertheless opposed to social conservatives.
