History
The Media Research Center (MRC) is a politically conservative content analysis organization based in Reston, Virginia,
[founded in 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Research_Center) by activist L. Brent Bozell III. Its mission is to “prove—through sound scientific research—that liberal bias in the media exists and undermines traditional American values.” According to their [about page](https://www.mrc.org/about), “MRC’s sole mission is to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media. This makes the MRC’s work unique within the conservative movement.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, MRC does not produce original content but links to other websites such as MRCTV, Newsbusters, and CNS News. These sources frequently utilize strong loaded emotional language such as this:
[The Embarrassing Questions NBC’s Moderators NEVER Asked](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/geoffrey-dickens/2019/06/28/embarrassing-questions-nbcs-moderators-never-asked). Articles are typically properly sourced; however, they use the Questionable CNS News as a primary source. CNS News has failed numerous fact-checks by IFCN fact-checkers.
The primary purpose of MRC is to expose liberal bias in the media. They often claim there is a conspiracy in the media to promote liberalism while suppressing conservatism. Journalist Brian Montopoli of
[Columbia Journalism Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-journalism-review/) in 2005 [labeled MRC](https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/propaganda_clothed_as_critique.php?page=all) “just one part of a wider movement by the far right to demonize corporate media” rather than “make the media better.” Essentially, MRC is a propaganda outlet for the Republican Party.
When it comes to science, MRC advocates for
