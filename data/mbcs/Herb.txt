Analysis / Bias
In review, Herb publishes news related to cannabis and product reviews and guides. News is reported with minimally loaded emotional language, such as
[Now Is The Time To Free Prisoners Convicted On Cannabis Charges](https://herb.co/news/now-is-the-time-to-free-prisoners-convicted-on-cannabis-charges/). The story is properly sourced to justice.gov, bjs.gov, and [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/). They also publish recipes that use cannabis, such as this [How To Make Easy-Peasy Pot Brownies](https://herb.co/recipes/easy-peasy-pot-brownies/).
Editorially, Herb holds liberal perspectives advocating for marijuana legalization and social justice, such as this
[Trump’s War On Drugs Has Always Been A War On Immigrants](https://herb.co/news/legalization/trumps-war-on-drugs-immigrants/).
Although most information on this website is pro-science, there are instances where they have made pseudoscientific claims that
[Cannabis can cure cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/). For example, the claims [5 Common Illnesses you Didn’t Know Marijuana can Cure](https://herb.co/news/health/5-common-illnesses-didnt-know-marijuana-can-cure/) and [These Are The 4 Ways Cannabis Kills Cancer](https://herb.co/news/health/cannabis-kills-cancer/). Currently, there isn’t [scientific evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6426557/) to support that Marijuana cures cancer or kills cancer cells.
