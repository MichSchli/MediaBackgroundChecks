History
Founded in 1867 by Journalist Vittorio Bersezio,
[La Stampa](https://books.google.com/books?id=9t_pAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT96&lpg=PT96&dq=la+stampa+Vittorio+Bersezio&source=bl&ots=myTrgFLY2y&sig=ACfU3U3Yt_4jFTS_ToZKhloL-yybcMiHHw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilmZ-l3N3mAhWJd98KHVzQCq0Q6AEwBXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=la%20stampa%20Vittorio%20Bersezio&f=false) is an Italian daily newspaper based in Turin, Italy. It was initially called Gazzetta Piemontese. In 1894, Entrepreneur Alfredo Frassati bought the paper, and in the 1920s, the paper held anti-fascist editorial positions. Later, ownership was passed to the FIAT Group (Agnelli Family). However, [in 2016](https://www.ft.com/content/e739b472-e090-11e5-96b7-9f778349aba2) the FIAT Group sold its shares to their rival De Benedetti Family (GEDI), which was considered the biggest consolidation in Italian print media. In December 2019, FIAT [re-acquired](https://www.exor.com/press-releases/2019-12-02/agreement-signed-sale-exor-cirs-4378-shareholding-gedi) La Stampa.

Analysis / Bias
La Stampa is generally regarded as politically
[leaning left](https://www.ft.com/content/e739b472-e090-11e5-96b7-9f778349aba2).
In review, La Stampa utilizes minimally loaded emotional wording in headlines that favor Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (Center-Left) and are critical of Far right-populist Lega (League) leader Matteo Salvini:
[“The fate of the Conte government lies in the hands of the Consulta](https://www.lastampa.it/topnews/firme/dentro-la-politica/2019/12/27/news/il-destino-del-governo-conte-e-nelle-mani-della-consulta-1.38257711).” This article, [“Salvini wants to lead Italy. He may be about to get the chance,”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/18/matteo-salvini-italy-populist-league-five-star-movement) is written by Maurizio Molinari, the editor-in-chief of La Stampa.
They are also critical of their coalition partner, the populist 5 Star Movement. A quote from the article describing the 5 Star Movement reads, “more ambiguous in its political positioning, is increasingly seen as a collection of losers.”
On the issues, when covering immigrants, La Stampa utilizes minimally loaded emotional wording in their headlines, such as
[“For days closed in a truck: they were not thieves, but children fleeing the war.”](https://www.lastampa.it/torino/2019/12/20/news/da-giorni-chiusi-in-un-tir-non-erano-ladri-ma-ragazzini-in-fuga-dalla-guerra-1.38238202) When covering foreign politics pertaining to the USA, they typically are neutral and fact-based such as [this](https://www.lastampa.it/esteri/2018/07/30/news/trump-conte-sta-facendo-un-lavoro-fantastico-ok-alla-cabina-di-regia-italia-usa-per-la-libia-1.34035271).
