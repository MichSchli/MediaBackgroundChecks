Analysis / Bias

They also offer articles and blogs that discuss ethical considerations related to veganism, such as
[A Vegan’s Guide to Ethical Swimming](https://www.vegansociety.com/#mm-13).
Editorially, the Vegan Society holds left-leaning viewpoints such as this
[Andy West reveals why veganism can alleviate the suffering of all, animals and humans alike.](https://www.vegansociety.com/news/blog/animal-suffering-human-suffering-why-human-rights-support-veganism) They also report [negatively on conservatives](https://www.vegansociety.com/get-involved/research/research-news/vegan-friendship) such as this: “Meanwhile, conservatives tend to view veganism as a threat to existing ways of living and thus a threat to the stability of the community. This helps explain why conservative and right-wing ideologies are more hostile towards veganism than left-wing and liberal ideologies.” Further, the organization advocates for social causes favored by the left, such as [LGBTQIA rights](https://www.vegansociety.com/news/blog/queer-appalachian-vegans-thoughts-pride-and-intersectional-social-justice-movements) and concern with [climate change](https://www.vegansociety.com/get-involved/research/research-news/unveiling-fascination-thriving-study-veganism).
Finally, while the website is clearly biased towards promoting veganism, it does not appear to engage in pseudoscience. The information provided is generally factual, and sources are cited where applicable.
