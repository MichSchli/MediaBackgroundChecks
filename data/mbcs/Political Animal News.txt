History
Political Animal News is a hyper-partisan conservative news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://politicalanimalnews.com/about/), “As Internet Goliaths like Google and Facebook move to censor and “crack down” on conservative viewpoints, we’re making sure that scheme won’t work.”
The website otherwise lacks transparency as the authors are not named, the domain is registered privately, and ownership is not revealed.

Analysis / Bias
Political Animal News does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left, such as this:
[Joe Biden just lashed out at Donald Trump with a jaw-dropping insult—and immediately regretted it after this response](https://politicalanimalnews.com/joe-biden-just-lashed-out-at-donald-trump-with-a-jaw-dropping-insult-and-immediately-regretted-it-after-this-response/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on the information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once again proved she’s out of touch with reality with one tweet](https://politicalanimalnews.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-once-again-proved-shes-out-of-touch-with-reality-with-one-tweet/), and [Christians cheered when this Republican Congressman just sent a Planned Parenthood official to his room without dessert](https://politicalanimalnews.com/christians-cheered-when-this-republican-congressman-just-sent-a-planned-parenthood-official-to-his-room-without-dessert/). In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing conspiracy theories and propaganda, sometimes using poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
