Analysis / Bias
An analysis of The Voice’s content reveals a focus on local events and community news relevant to Aurora and surrounding areas. Headlines such as “Santa, markets part of holiday Saturdays in downtown Aurora Dec 2, 9, and 16,” “Hollywood Casino Aurora breaks ground on $360-Million development,” “17th Annual Aurora Festival of Lights,” “DuPage County Board approve Fiscal Year,” and “Giving Tuesday worth saving and expanding” suggest a community-centric approach.
A review of articles and headlines reveals they do not contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[New small-scale nuclear technology in State](https://thevoice.us/new-small-scale-nuclear-technology-in-state/). This story is republished from Capitol News Illinois.
Editorially, most opinions are derived from reader commentary, which tends to lean right. However, the paper does offer op-eds that offer a mix of opinions, but many are critical of former President Trump such as this
[Trump supporters offer a variety of wacko theories](https://thevoice.us/trump-supporters-offer-a-variety-of-wacko-theories/), while those covering President Biden are less critical: [President Biden seeks solutions to border migration](https://thevoice.us/president-biden-seeks-solutions-to-border-migration/). In general, they are fact-based and offer a wide range of opinions covering both sides of issues.
