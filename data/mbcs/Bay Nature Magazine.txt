Analysis / Bias
Bay Nature Magazine and website covers news related to the San Francisco Bay area’s natural environment. They also provide information on
[trails](https://baynature.org/article/explore-the-bay-water-trail/), [nature events](https://baynature.org/events/), and [nature photography](https://baynature.org/2021/08/03/ethical-wildlife-photography-makes-for-better-wildlife-photos/). Many stories focus on science and nature; however, there is a strong emphasis on conservation and sustainability, such as this [Raptors Rather Than Rodenticide](https://baynature.org/article/raptors-rather-than-rodenticide/). This story utilizes primary sources of information.
Editorially, Bay Nature Magazine holds a left-leaning bias through the promotion of nature conservation,
[concern for the environment](https://baynature.org/?s=climate+change), and social justice such as this [Public Lands Have Become a Refuge for People Priced Out of Housing in the West. Local Tensions are Increasing. What Now?](https://baynature.org/article/public-lands-have-become-a-refuge-for-people-priced-out-of-housing-in-the-west-local-tensions-are-increasing-what-now/) When reporting on politics, they consistently favor democratic candidates and policies such as this [With Recall Election, California’s Environmental Future Up for Vote](https://baynature.org/2021/08/24/with-recall-election-californias-environmental-future-up-for-vote/). In general, Bay Nature Magazine is a pro-science source of information; however, they report on politics and advocate for left-leaning issues; therefore, we rate them Left-Center biased.
