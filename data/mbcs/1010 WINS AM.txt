Analysis / Bias
In review, the 1010 Wins website reports news through journalists in the form of written reports, radio clips, and video. Local news stories focus on crime and lifestyle and utilize minimally loaded language such as this:
[Homeless man covered in bed bugs found dead on subway train: report](https://1010wins.radio.com/articles/homeless-man-covered-in-bed-bugs-found-dead-on-subway-train). National and international news is usually provided through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). The website also features a section dedicated to politics that again uses the Associated Press for national politics and local journalists for local news such as this: [NY Times endorses Klobuchar, Warren in Democratic contest](https://1010wins.radio.com/articles/ap-news/ny-times-endorses-klobuchar-warren-in-democratic-contest).
The website does not produce editorial content, and political stories tend to be balanced and low-biased in wording.
