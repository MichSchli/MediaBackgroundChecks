Analysis / Bias
In review, American Affairs breaks down articles into sections such as “Populism, Immigration, and the Border.” Within this section is an article titled:
[Containing the Drug Cartels: A Case for the Border Wall](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/11/containing-the-drug-cartels-a-case-for-the-border-wall/), in which there is support for Donald Trump’s wall. The article is very well sourced to credible media outlets and organizations. The following section is “Neoliberalism against the Market,” followed by “Nationalism and Democracy,” and lastly, “Corporate Culture.”
Each article uses minimally loaded words in the headlines, and the articles are very well written. In general, the stories published in American Affairs align with the right; however, there is
[not always support for former President Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/opinion/sunday/i-voted-for-trump-and-i-sorely-regret-it.html). Further, American Affairs has received positive reviews from left-leaning sources. For example, the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) said, “. . . as good a place as any to go looking for the intellectual future of conservatism.” and the [New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/) said, “Generally speaking, an upstart journal should be both invigorating and somewhat strange, and American Affairs succeeds on both counts.”
