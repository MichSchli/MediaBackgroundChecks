History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/revolver.news), Revolver.News is a conservative news aggregation/curation website that claims to be the new [Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/). They claim, “Revolver News is dedicated to news aggregation and analysis at the bottom of the articles. While we greatly respect and admire Matt Drudge, the Drudge Report no longer has its finger on the pulse of America. We aim to fill that void and much more. We are dedicated to providing Americans of all backgrounds and political persuasions with timely, common-sense, accurate, and compelling information.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page, name authors or editors, and does not openly disclose ownership.
Funded by / Ownership
Revolver.News lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership. Advertising, donations, and a shop that sells branded merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Revolver.News primarily aggregates news from external sources. Most stories favor the right and frequently utilize loaded emotional headlines and wording, such as this
[TRUMP SUPPORTER COMMITS SUICIDE AFTER GETTING CAUGHT IN LEFT’S INJUSTICE SYSTEM…](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/09/breaking-omaha-bar-owner-charged-killing-rioter-attacked-business-committed-suicide/) This story links to the right-wing conspiracy website the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). Other aggregated news stories come from credible sources such as [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/), [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and Local News Stations. However, some stories are published from low-quality sources such as [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [Hot Air](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hot-air/), [Wayne Dupree](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/waynedupree-com/), and Twitter.
Editorially, Revolver.News occasionally produces original content that aligns with the right and is generally favorable toward the former Trump administration, such as
[While A Terrific Judge, Amy Coney Barrett May Create Electoral Pitfalls For Trump 2020](https://www.revolver.news/2020/09/while-a-terrific-judge-amy-coney-barrett-may-create-electoral-pitfalls-for-trump-2020/). Although this is an opinion piece, it does not provide a single hyperlinked source to verify its claims. In general, Revolver.News reports news from a strong right-leaning perspective and lacks credibility due to a complete lack of transparency.
