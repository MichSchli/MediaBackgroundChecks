According to their [about page](https://www.nationaljournal.com/about), “National Journal keeps members informed about key movements in people, politics, and policy.” They also publish daily journalism covering politics and public policy that is led by President Kevin Turpin.

Analysis / Bias
In review, National Journal provides news, research, and information to politicians, lobbyists, and corporate government affairs teams. Unfortunately, National Journal’s content is behind a paywall, and therefore we rely on third-party assessments of bias. For example,
[Allsides](https://www.allsides.com/news-source/national-journal) lists National Journal as “center” based on over 1800 votes from community members. On the other hand, Skyline College Library lists them as [Conservative](https://skylinecollege.edu/library/informationliteracy/evaluatingsources/political.php). When we last reviewed National Journal in 2016, we determined they were a least biased source and high for factual reporting. We do not have enough evidence to change the rating; therefore, this is a low-confidence review.
