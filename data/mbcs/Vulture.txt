Funded by / Ownership
Vulture is owned by
[Vox Media,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media) which is a digital publishing network founded by [Jerome Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Armstrong), Tyler Bleszinski, and [Markos Moulitsas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markos_Moulitsas) and based in Washington, D.C. According to a [Nieman Lab ](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/built-on-passion-how-vox-media-grew-from-its-roots-as-an-oakland-as-blog-into-one-of-the-internets-biggest-publishers/)article, Vox Media had eight editorial brands and a custom advertising division. These are (sports-focused) SB Nation, (tech site) [The Verge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/), (real estate blog) Curbed, (food and nightlife) Eater, (technology news) Racked, (news hub) [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), and (technology business) [Recode](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/recode/).
However, in 2019 they merged with New York Media adding
[New York Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-magazine/), [The Cut](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-cut/), and others. Further, a New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/business/media/nbcuniversal-invests-200-million-in-vox-media.html) dated 2015 states that NBC Universal, which Comcast owns, invested $200 Million in Vox Media. Revenue for Vulture is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Vulture primarily covers entertainment news; however, when they cover news related to politics, they have a left-leaning bias in story selection. Vulture uses moderately loaded words when describing conservatives: “
[Colbert Sings a Scathing Cowboy Ballad for Roy Moore and the Horse He Rode in On](http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/colbert-sings-scathing-cowboy-ballad-about-roy-moore.html).” Further, all articles are well-sourced to credible media outlets.
