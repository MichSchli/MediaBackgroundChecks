Analysis / Bias
In review, KQED.org publishes radio programs, podcasts, videos, and news stories for the San Francisco Bay area. Most news reporting is original from reporters and journalists that utilize minimally loaded language such as this:
[Coronavirus: What’s Reopening in Each Bay Area County](https://www.kqed.org/science/1963889/coronavirus-some-bay-area-counties-are-about-to-open-up-more-heres-where-your-county-stands). This story is properly sourced from government resources. While they do not publish actual opinion pieces or specifically offer emotional appeals, their story selection frequently favors the left.
For example, they have a section dedicated to
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) with articles such as this: [Climate Lawsuits by California Cities, Counties Transferred to State Court in Victory Over Oil Companies](https://www.kqed.org/science/1964947/climate-lawsuits-by-california-cities-counties-transferred-to-state-court-in-victory-over-oil-companies). They also report frequently on LGBTQ issues [No Parade? No Problem — SF Pride Launches Online Celebration](https://www.kqed.org/coronavirusliveupdates) and pro-immigration stories [Essential Workers with Temporary Protected Status Could be at Risk of Deportation](https://www.kqed.org/news/11824078/essential-workers-with-temporary-protected-status-could-be-at-risk-of-deportation). Generally, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning bias in story selection.
