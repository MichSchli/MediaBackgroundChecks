Analysis / Bias
In review, Sanctum News is a satire website that pokes fun at the religious and pseudo-scientists such as this:
[Crystal Therapy is Out and Crystal DIET is IN!](https://www.sanctumnews.com/crystal-therapy-is-out-and-crystal-diet-is-in/) The website appropriately describes they are satire [here](https://www.sanctumnews.com/disclaimer/): “Sanctum News should be considered a parody/satire. Nothing on the site is real and even names that match real people, events, organizations or any other real nouns are purely coincidental. Nothing on this website is of value and no one anywhere should visit this website at anytime.”
