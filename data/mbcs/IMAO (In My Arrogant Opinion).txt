Analysis / Bias
In review, IMAO typically uses a real news story and interjects humor and sarcasm into it. Most times this humor is at the expense of the left. A story example is as follows:
[Shocking New Study Shows That the Cure for Racism Is Global Warming](https://www.imao.us/index.php/2019/07/shocking-new-study-shows-that-the-cure-for-racism-is-global-warming/). This humorous story sources the fictitious [Seth Brundle](https://thefly.fandom.com/wiki/Seth_Brundle) from the movie, The Fly.
