Analysis / Bias
In review, National Affairs is a well-written academic conservative magazine. Most stories favor right-leaning interests and use minimally loaded language in headlines and articles. Example:
[Lessons in Regulatory Oversight.](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/lessons-in-regulatory-oversight) This article is written for an educated audience and does not use emotional words to sway the reader. It simply presents supporting evidence for the opinion. Since this is a print magazine, hyperlinked sourcing is not used; however, the article refers to where information comes from. In general, story selection almost always favors limited government conservative positions.
