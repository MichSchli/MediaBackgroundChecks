History
Twitchy is an American Twitter curation and news website founded by conservative commentator
[Michelle Malkin](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michelle-malkin/) in 2012. According to their [about page](https://twitchy.com/page/about/) “Twitchy is a ground-breaking social media curation site powered by a kinetic staff of social media junkies. We mine Twitter to bring you “who said what” in U.S. & global news, sports, entertainment, media, and breaking news 24/7. If it’s news, we’re on it.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not claim to have a political orientation, despite the entirety of the content being conservative. They also do not mention that the website was founded by Michelle Malkin.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Twitchy does not produce original content but rather provides conservative commentary around tweets. Headlines are often sensationalized to denigrate the left, such as this:
[Biden campaign reminds top donors to ‘dig deep’ so Joe can keep chartering jets to run for president and warn people about climate change](https://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2019/10/26/biden-campaign-reminds-top-donors-to-dig-deep-so-joe-can-keep-chartering-jets-to-run-for-president-and-warn-people-about-climate-change/). This story links to various Twitter users and the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). The stories published on Twitchy always favor the right and routinely mock the left.
Regarding sourcing, they usually cite conservative Twitter accounts such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) or the [NRA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-rifle-association-nra/). They also source completely unknown Twitter users. The bottom line is that Twitchy is only as accurate as the tweets they share. This is essentially a right-wing propaganda website.
