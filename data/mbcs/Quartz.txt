Analysis / Bias
In review, Quartz’s content mainly consists of large images, charts, and/or graphs. Quartz publishes stories with neutral headlines such as
[“To understand Trump’s speech, look at the US-Mexico border as it exists today](https://qz.com/1517907/what-the-us-mexico-border-wall-actually-looks-like-right-now/)” and strong, emotionally loaded language such as [“A living glossary of all the words you need to understand the Trump presidency.”](https://qz.com/845040/donald-trump-glossary/) A quote from the article reads, “Trump is seen as the editor-in-chief of the fake news movement because of his disregard of facts, such as when he claimed in a recent tweet, with no supporting evidence, that millions voted illegally in the US election.” When it comes to sourcing, they typically utilize credible sources such as [c-span.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/c-span/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Huffington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), and [USA Today.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/)
Editorially, Quartz does not endorse any political party. However, Quartz does not have a favorable view of former President Trump with consistent negative articles about his administration:
[Another scandal-ridden member of Trump’s cabinet is resigning](https://qz.com/1496890/ryan-zinke-to-resign-by-end-of-year-trump-says/). Further, they tend to report negatively on conservatives such as this [The most radical Americans of 2019 are the ethical conservatives](https://qz.com/1775505/the-most-radical-americans-of-2019-are-the-ethical-conservatives/). Lastly, Quartz is generally pro-science with its [reporting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) on [GMOs](https://qz.com/re/gmos/) and [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).
