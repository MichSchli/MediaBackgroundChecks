Analysis / Bias
WorldNewsERA does not produce original content but instead aggregates news stories along a wide range of topics and republishes the articles in full. Despite giving credit to the original source, republishing full articles verbatim from other sources is plagiarism and copyright infringement.
While they generally rely on credible mainstream sources like the
