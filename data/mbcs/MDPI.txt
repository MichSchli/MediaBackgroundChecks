Analysis / Bias
In review, The reputation of the MDPI has been criticized over the years. For example, in 2012, Erik Andrulis published a
[paper](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/hilarious-theory-everything-paper-provokes-kerfuffle-hullabaloo-foofaraw/) in a new journal called Life (MDPI). The credible pro-science magazine [science.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/science-magazine/) published a [critical review](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/how-andrulis-paper-got-published) of how the paper passed peer review. They state, “I know what I would have said if they’d sent the paper to me: that it was a perfect example of what happens when an active, learned mind begins to slip loose from its moorings, and that while the paper appeared to have no scientific merit at all, it was quite useful as a diagnostic sign of oncoming psychosis.”
In 2018, editors of the journal
[Nutrients](https://www.science.org/content/article/open-access-editors-resign-after-alleged-pressure-publish-mediocre-papers) resigned en masse, claiming that allegedly MDPI pressured them “to publish mediocre papers.” Nutrients is an open-access journal of human clinical nutrition published by MDPI.
MDPI was on a list of predatory publishers maintained by
[Jeffrey Beall](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/405/6348133), a librarian at the University of Colorado in Boulder, until its appeal. However, according to the journal [Research Evaluation](https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/30/3/405/6348133), they are and continue to be a Predatory Journal. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals. In most cases, peer review is minimal, and studies are published simply because they are paid for.
An example of poor peer review can be found when the
[MDPI journal](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/review_report) accepted a paper titled “The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations—We Should Rethink the Policy” later, MDPI [retracted](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34202529/) the article. The study also caught the attention of fact-checkers who rendered it a Flawed Study (see below). In addition, according to [Retraction Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/retraction-watch/), MDPI has [retracted dozens of studies over the years](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-publisher/mdpi-by-publisher/page/2/).
Another criticism about MDPI is having its headquarters in Switzerland only to cover publishing activities in Asia. Therefore the quality of some published journals and the review process have also been called into question.
Finally, as evidenced by the below fact checks, MDPI has promoted Covid-19 misinformation in their journals. While they may be mostly pro-science and publish many valid studies, they also occasionally promote pseudoscience and misleading flawed studies. However, if you consider they publish over
[400 journals](https://www.mdpi.com/about/journals), it indicates they are usually accurate.
