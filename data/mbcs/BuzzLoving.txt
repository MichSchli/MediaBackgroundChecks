Analysis / Bias
BuzzLoving employs clickbait headlines and a tabloid structure, often prioritizing sensationalism over accuracy. It uses images, like stock photos, interspersed throughout the text. For instance, the headline
[Connecticut School Kids As Young As 8 Were Shown A Video About Gender Identity, Sent Home With “Puberty Kits” – Parents Are Angry’](https://buzzloving.com/connecticut-school-kids-as-young-as-8-were-shown-a-video-about-gender-identity-sent-home-with-puberty-kits-parents-are-angry/)‘ is emotionally charged and provocative. The article discusses an incident at a Granby, Connecticut, elementary school where children were shown a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LR9pu9tEOw) about gender identity and pride month without parental permission. However, it lacks hyperlinked sources to substantiate its claims. A quick internet search reveals that it mirrors a [story](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12164991/Elementary-school-students-Connecticut-sent-home-puberty-kit.html) from the UK-based [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), known as an [unreliable source](https://www.businessinsider.com/wikipedia-has-banned-the-daily-mail-as-an-unreliable-source-2017-2) and categorized as a questionable source by MBFC. The Daily Mail cites [WFSB](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wfsb-hartford-news-bias/), a local Hartford news station, which initially reported on the incident but didn’t mention puberty kits. BuzzLoving and Daily Mail have added details not present in the original WFSB report.
The article also
[failed to note](https://www.ctpublic.org/news/2023-06-07/granby-parents-meet-with-school-board-to-discuss-pride-video-shown-in-school) that the puberty kits have been distributed for years, according to Board of Education member Monica Logan. Logan said the Kit was distributed on a separate occasion and said parents were notified in advance.
In another article titled
[‘Man Finds Shark Egg on Beach with an Actual Live Shark in It, Takes It Home to Hatch,’](https://buzzloving.com/man-finds-shark-egg-on-beach/) the sources used in the article include quotes from the man and references to the event with a Tiktok video. However, it doesn’t provide any external links or references to verify the information, a common practice in tabloid journalism.
BuzzLoving also publishes stories critical of
[Biden](https://buzzloving.com/biden-impeachment-might-come-soon-gop-lawmaker-suggests-and-a-very-brave-irs-whistleblower-might-be-the-key-figure-in-it/) and [Trump](https://buzzloving.com/rooting-for-trump-to-go-down-many-republicans-are-eagerly-awaiting-trumps-indictment/) with sensational clickbait headlines. In general, BuzzLoving does not meet credibility standards based on using poor sources and misleading headlines designed to induce clicks (Clickbait).
