The Trace describes their
[mission](https://www.thetrace.org/about-the-trace/) as “exclusively dedicated to reporting on our country’s gun violence crisis. We use the power of journalism to improve public understanding, increase accountability, and identify solutions that can lead to safer homes and communities for all Americans.”
In review, The Trace publishes statistics and news stories that highlight the dangers of guns and the need for gun control. The Trace is highly factual through official and scientific sources such as the
[CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), [Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), and the FBI. There is minimal use of loaded words as The Trace is evidence-based in presentation.
Editorially, they align more with the left based on their concern for guns and increased regulations. In general, they are factual and lean left in bias.
