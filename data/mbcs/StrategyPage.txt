Analysis / Bias
In review, StrategyPage covers global conflicts, weapons of war, and strategy. There is little use of loaded language, and they primarily use news wire sources such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). Almost all of the other sources used on this website are either on our [least biased list](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/) or High in factual reporting. A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=strategypage&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have never failed a fact check.
