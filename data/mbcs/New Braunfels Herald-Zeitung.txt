Analysis / Bias
The New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung offers a blend of local stories such as
[“New Braunfels’ Ashley Landerman wins Food Network Holiday Baking Championship”](https://herald-zeitung.com/news/new-braunfels-ashley-landerman-wins-food-network-holiday-baking-championship/article_311d201e-9e85-11ee-a546-7352aae38d84.html) and opinion pieces. A notable aspect of its content is the tendency to publish right-leaning articles, especially those critical of the [Biden Administration](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). The articles also lack hyperlinked sourcing.
Prominent among these is the work of a chief political correspondent for the
[Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) and a [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) contributor Byron York’s articles, such as [” As Trump’s Lead Widens, Prosecutors Pursue,”](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/york-as-trump-s-lead-widens-prosecutors-pursue/article_59618b86-99db-11ee-aaec-23866a9b1e2d.html) exhibit a clear bias in favor of former [President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), often suggesting politically motivated actions by the Biden administration. This pattern is evident in several other headlines republished by The New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung.
[“YORK: Team Biden’s ‘misinformation’ campaign”](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/york-team-biden-s-misinformation-campaign/article_ac982efe-8ed7-11ee-ad75-33d2ac7eb49e.html) [“YORK: Three reasons why Trump leads Biden.”](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/york-three-reasons-why-trump-leads-biden/article_76adf1b0-7e5c-11ee-9c37-43b216537bde.html) [“YORK: Joe Biden’s intentional border crisis”](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/york-joe-biden-s-intentional-border-crisis/article_fec1663c-5d4f-11ee-b5f2-93a8b2310ef7.html) [“The Biden White House is a mess of a dumpster fire.”](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/the-biden-white-house-is-a-mess-of-a-dumpster-fire/article_9addee3e-47e8-11ec-aa35-8f3a9667773c.html)
The New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung also republishes
[stories](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/outside-view-dallas-woman-s-complicated-pregnancy-shows-why-abortion-law-needs-to-change/article_b7064756-9e89-11ee-9c09-1b9910b38db0.html#:~:text=Kate%20Cox%20left%20the%20state,could%20legally%20perform%20the%20procedure.) from other right-leaning sources, such as the [Fort Worth Star-Telegram](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/star-telegram/), known for its high right-center bias and rated High by Media Bias Fact Check. In addition to its regular content, the New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung also features letters to the editor, such as ‘ [“Disappointed in Abbott,”](https://herald-zeitung.com/opinion/disappointed-in-abbott/article_f3e3004a-6f6a-11ee-8255-6f51b7c308d0.html) which offer individual viewpoints. While these letters provide a platform for diverse opinions, they do not necessarily reflect the newspaper’s editorial bias as directly as the articles and op-eds by regular contributors like Byron York. The inclusion of such letters indicates the paper’s openness to a range of perspectives, but the consistent publication of right-leaning articles by authors like York more strongly suggests the newspaper’s editorial leanings.
