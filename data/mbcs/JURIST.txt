Analysis / Bias
JURIST is an online legal news service that
[claims](https://www.jurist.org/faq/#section13) to be accurate and impartial in its reporting. News articles do not contain emotional wording with headlines such as this Montana TikTok user [file lawsuit to stop state ban from going into effect](https://www.jurist.org/news/2023/05/montana-tiktok-users-file-lawsuit-to-stop-state-ban-from-going-into-effect/#). This story, like all others reviewed, is properly sourced from credible outlets such as the [ACLU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-civil-liberties-union-aclu/), Congress.gov, and Cornell Law.
The website also provides opinion commentary that is reasonably balanced; however, more opinions favor the left such as this
[How Granting a River Legal Personhood Could Bring a Measure of Environmental Justice to Albania](https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2023/05/make-vjosa-river-a-person/#) and [India Needs to End Discriminatory Ban on LGBTQ+ Blood Donations](https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2023/05/blood-donation-discrimination-india/#). In general, JURIST provides a diversity of viewpoints and perspectives on the law with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
