Analysis / Bias
The New York Daily News is well known for sensational headlines that use strong loaded words such as this:
[Cuomo slams NYCHA says agency ‘lied’ about handling tenant repair requests.](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-cuomo-slams-nycha-20180722-story.html) The Daily News primarily focuses on New York City news and produces hard-hitting journalism. New York Times journalist [Alan Feuer said](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/nyregion/the-daily-news-layoffs-and-digital-shift-may-signal-the-tabloid-eras-end.html) the Daily News focuses heavily on “deep sourcing and doorstep reporting,” providing city-centered “crime reportage and hard-hitting coverage of public issues.” Generally, the Daily News is well sourced to credible information.
Editorially, the Daily News leans left but has endorsed Republican George Bush for President and Barack Obama and
