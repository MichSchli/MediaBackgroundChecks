Analysis / Bias
In review, The Brownsville Herald covers local news through journalists with minimal loaded words in headlines and stories such as this:
[Number of migrants released in Brownsville continues to rise.](https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/number-of-migrants-released-in-brownsville-continues-to-rise/article_243ed60e-5663-11e9-9ebe-c7e1c9d75f72.html) National and world news is republished from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, opinions tend to lean left, with many opposed to former President Trump and his border wall (Brownsville borders Mexico). Here is a quote from an
[editorial piece](https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/upgrades-not-walls/article_6d8d05cc-4477-11e9-ac30-8f358af1848f.html) that utilizes strong emotional wording: “For too long President Trump has spun fantasies of crime in border cities like McAllen to sell his border wall. His latest ploy? Declaring a “national emergency,” to force Rio Grande Valley residents to surrender property and public lands and restrict humans’ and animals’ freedom of movement to fulfill a campaign slogan.” In general, straight news reporting demonstrates minimal bias, however, editorially, there is a moderate left-leaning bias.
