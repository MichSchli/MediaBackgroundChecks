Analysis / Bias
Just Facts Daily (JFD) is a news, opinion, and fact-checking website with a right-center bias in reporting. JFD’s tagline is “Be Informed, Not Just Opinionated.” This website is certainly informative, but it also appears to be quite opinionated.
In review, each article is also impeccably sourced to mostly credible information to convey its narrative. The right-center bias designation comes from multiple factors. First, there is excessive use of loaded emotional words in the headlines. The following loaded words (words that attempt to influence through positive or negative emotion) were found in the first 15 headlines: Incompetent, Dishonest, Catastrophically, Deceitful, Brazen Lie, Smearing, Deadly Falsehoods. Most of these words appeared in headlines when the topic was about liberal politicians or liberal policy. Further, the headlines that described conservative policy did not contain these negative connotations. They were mostly neutral in wording.
To keep this short, I will discuss only one article. The article is entitled “
[Clinton and Obama’s Brazen Lie About the Iraq Withdrawal](http://www.justfactsdaily.com/clinton-obama-lie-iraq-withdrawal/).” The loaded language, “Brazen Lie,” does not fit the content of the article. Clinton and Obama cite the [SOFA agreement](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/18/jeb-bush/obama-refused-sign-plan-place-leave-10000-troops-i/) as to why our troops’ withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. This is true and not a brazen lie. There is, however, more to the story and JFD did an excellent job of showing that they could have legally extended the troop’s time in Iraq but chose not to. Overall, the article is well-sourced and, for the most part, is accurate. The bias is conveyed through the author’s attempt to show that Obama and Clinton are primarily responsible for the rise of ISIS due to abiding by the SOFA agreement signed by former President Bush. In 2011, at the time of the troop withdrawal, ISIS was not considered a threat, and it could not be [predicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/world/middleeast/obama-fault-is-shared-in-misjudging-of-isis-threat.html?_r=0) that they would increase in size and strength in such a short time. Essentially, the entire article is an attempt to blame the Obama administration for something unforeseen at the time.

In summary, this is generally a factual website from a sourcing standpoint and is impressively researched. However, it conveys a right-leaning bias through story selection that is more favorable toward
