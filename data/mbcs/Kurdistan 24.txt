Analysis / Bias
In review, Kurdistan 24 is moderately biased toward
[liberal causes](http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/aboutus) such as “ [Ethnic and religious diversity, tolerance cornerstone of new Kurdistan state.](http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/Analysis/31d42429-c2d9-4135-85de-34ce5234fa43)” Kurdistan 24 uses moderate loaded language in headlines and also the body of articles, such as: “ [Any Turkish military operation in Afrin will fail, be faced with strong resistance: Kurdish official](http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/8431fdf4-fb17-4677-9f28-338c845059f9).” Although the articles tend to be well written, they are often poorly sourced, mostly through quotes, instead of links.
