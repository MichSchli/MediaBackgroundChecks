History
[Founded in 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/blackeyepolitics.com), Black Eye Politics is a strong right-leaning news and opinion website. The website lacks transparency as there isn’t an about page, authors listed on news stories, and no mention of an owner. There aren’t any names associated with the website.

Funded by / Ownership
Black Eye Politics does not reveal ownership; however, it states at the bottom of each web page it is held through Conservative Alternative Network LLC. We have determined that David Warrington owns the website through
[American Patriot News Network, LLC](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_va/S7105366), which publishes a network of conservative sites such as [americanpatriotdaily.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-patriot-daily/), [greatamericandaily.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/great-american-daily/), [deepstatejournal.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/deep-state-journal-bias/), and [conservativerevival.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-revival-bias/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Black Eye Politics publishes news and opinions with an extreme right-wing bias. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left by using loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Joe Biden Said One Thing That Means a Top Democrat Will Destroy Him](https://blackeyepolitics.com/joe-biden-top-democrat-destroy-him/). The article itself also contains significant loaded quotes such as this: “In the current era, Democrats are more insane than they have ever been.” Another example of highly loaded wording is [Nancy Pelosi’s Own Party Just Smacked Her With Horrible News](https://blackeyepolitics.com/nancy-pelosis-party-horrible-news/).
Like most on the website, this story either does not provide hyperlinked sourcing or is linked to the Questionable
[Great American Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/great-american-daily/). In general, this is an extremely right-biased propaganda website.
