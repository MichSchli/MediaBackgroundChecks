Analysis / Bias
In review, Washington Press presents news with a borderline extreme left-wing bias that always favors the left and is always anti-Trump and the political right. There is the frequent and very strong use of loaded words in both headlines and articles, such as this:
[Trump just declared war on the First Amendment in an unhinged cabinet meeting](http://washingtonpress.com/2018/01/10/trump-just-declared-war-first-amendment-unhinged-cabinet-meeting/), and this [Texas Republicans’ cruel remarks about California come back to haunt them as winter storms ravage](https://washingtonpress.com/2021/02/16/texas-republicans-cruel-remarks-about-california-come-back-to-haunt-them-as-winter-storms-ravage/).
The Washington Press usually sources their information from credible mainstream media outlets; however, they
[sometimes](http://washingtonpress.com/2018/01/10/white-house-just-got-busted-editing-official-transcript-hide-major-trump-screw/) use poor sources such as [Shareblue](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shareblue/), which has a mixed record with fact-checking.
Editorially, most stories align with the progressive left, such as this
[Trump just slapped the LGBTQ community in the face during Pride Month.](https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/02/trump-just-slapped-the-lgbtq-community-in-the-face-during-pride-month/) They generally hold a strong left-leaning bias and are not always factual.
