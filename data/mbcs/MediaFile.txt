Analysis / Bias
In review, most stories published on Mediafile tend to slightly favor the left through story selection. On op-ed’s, they use minimally loaded headlines such as
[“Reporters Must Adapt to the Era of Constant Scandal.”](http://www.mediafiledc.com/reporters-must-adapt-era-constant-scandal/) In general, MediaFile sources to verifiable and credible left-leaning media sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). However, they sometimes source to factually [mixed sources](http://www.mediafiledc.com/fox-news-loves-liberals/) such as [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) and [Fox News to make points.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/)
This is an updated review looking at changes in bias. We find that the paper maintains a Left-Center lean through editorial positions such as this
[Western Media Covers Israel-Palestine Conflict with Pro-Israel Bias, Experts Say](https://www.mediafiledc.com/media-covers-israel-palestine-conflict-with-bias/). Mediafile produces factual news that continues to be liberal-leaning in bias.
