History
[Founded in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network), One America News Network (OANN), also referred to as One America News (OAN), is an American right-wing pay television news channel and website. [According](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/an-inside-look-at-one-america-news-the-insurgent-tv-network-taking-pro-trump-to-new-heights/2017/07/05/7475f0a4-4fa2-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html?utm_term=.69a49a7a0dd4) to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), since the election of Donald Trump, OAN has become pro-Trump in coverage and a favorite news source. The President of Herring Networks [said](https://www.thedailybeast.com/one-america-news-network-new-conservative-cable-channel-sets-launch), “Fox News has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences…But those who consider themselves liberal have a half dozen or more choices on TV each day from which to get their news.” OAN has been [criticized](https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/how-one-america-news-became-the-ultimate-pro-trump-network/334171) for biased content that favors Donald Trump. [On 10/10/2019](https://www.oann.com/president-trump-thanks-oann-for-providing-fair-coverage-and-brilliant-reporting/), President Trump thanked OAN For Providing ‘Fair Coverage And Brilliant Reporting’.
After the 2020 Presidential election, OAN frequently promoted election fraud conspiracies that resulted in lawsuits. On 05/10/2022, they announced that there was no widespread election fraud and settled a suit

Funded by / Ownership
According to their
[about page](https://www.oann.com/about/), “One America News Network is owned by [Herring Networks, Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=322479928) Herring Networks, Inc. is a family-owned and operated, an independent media company focused on providing high-quality national television programming to consumers via its national cable networks.” Herring Networks is owned by Robert Herring Sr., who is a [Republican donor](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2018&cmte=C00252551). One America News receives funding through advertising and television subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, OAN is a far-right biased news channel and website that uses moderately loaded words in headlines and articles such as this:
[Sen. Schumer Refuses To Back Down On Border Wall Funding](https://www.oann.com/sen-schumer-refuses-to-back-down-on-border-wall-funding/). This article does not offer sourcing at all. In another article, [Senate Floats Restrictions On Detentions Of Illegal Aliens In Government Spending Bill,](https://www.oann.com/senate-floats-restrictions-on-detentions-of-illegal-aliens-in-government-spending-bill/) there is a lack of sourced information.
One America News writes articles that are very short and easy to read. They aim to keep stories
[under 1 minute long](https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/how-one-america-news-became-the-ultimate-pro-trump-network/334171). Story selection almost always favors the right and, in particular, [President Donald Trump](https://www.oann.com/?s=trump). An article in [AdWeek](https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/how-one-america-news-became-the-ultimate-pro-trump-network/334171) describes how the owner of Herring Networks directs his newsroom to favor Trump: “According to internal emails, Herring has directed his channel to push Trump’s candidacy, scuttle stories about police shootings, encourage antiabortion stories, minimize coverage of Russian aggression, and steer away from the new president’s troubles, according to more than a dozen current and former producers, writers and anchors, as well as internal emails from Herring and his top news executives.”
OAN has also promoted right-wing conspiracies such as the
[Seth Rich Murder](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/23/oan-offers-100k-reward-for-details-leading-to-arre/) and [no evidence](https://thinkprogress.org/far-right-website-no-evidence-of-a-chemical-attack-in-syria-affdfd59ded7/) of chemical attacks in Syria. Further, during the Coronavirus outbreak of 2020, they have frequently promoted misinformation, as evidenced by the failed fact checks below. Is OAN right-biased? Yes.
