Funded by / Ownership

[Savvy Investments, LLC](http://www.savvyinvestmentsllc.net/). Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, all articles are published by Paul Webber and primarily deal with opposition to Big Pharma and
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). For example, this article implies that [vaccines cause autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/), which is not true [Mom’s Letter ‘I’d Rather My Child Have Measles Than Autism’](http://newamericannews.com/moms-letter-id-rather-child-measles-autism/#). When not promoting medical misinformation they cover topics such as [Chemtrails](http://newamericannews.com/climate-engineering-cover-exposing-criminal-corporate-media-critical/#) and quackery stories such as this [Vaccines To Be Released Using Aerosol Spray From Planes](http://newamericannews.com/vaccines-released-using-aerosol-spray/#). Editorially, New American News tends to favor the right. Though less political than [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), the health content is similar. In general, this site completely lacks credibility.
