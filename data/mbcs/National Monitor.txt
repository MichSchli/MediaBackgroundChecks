Analysis / Bias
National Monitor offers articles from the far left to the far right and everything in between. The articles from the staff writers on NM are consistently well-written, factual, and well-sourced. They also offer some refreshingly different views on subjects.
For example, in the article “Free College Tuition? Meh.” author Michael Patrick Lewis, a self-proclaimed liberal, offers an interesting and thought-provoking view / mild rebuttal of the free College for everyone idea popular among liberals and progressives.
*This updated review indicates that they have not published an article since 2020 and may be on the verge of retirement.
