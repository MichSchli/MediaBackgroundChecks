Analysis / Bias
The Voice of OC publishes local and regional news through journalists such as this:
[Will “Seal Beach Voters Elect OC’s First Openly Transgender City Council Member?”](https://voiceofoc.org/2023/01/will-seal-beach-voters-elect-ocs-first-openly-transgender-city-council-member/) In this story, they cover both candidates in the Seal Beach City Council race, mentioning Wade’s priorities and campaign, as well as Landau as her opponent, and includes a statement from Wade’s campaign about alleged transphobic attacks from Landau’s campaign, but notes that Landau did not respond to a request for comment. Therefore, it seems that Voice of OC is attempting to cover both sides of the race, although Landau’s lack of response limits the extent to which both sides can be fully represented.
Another article,
[“Major OC Republican Group Lost on 96% of its Big Local Bets in Latest Election,”](https://voiceofoc.org/2023/01/major-oc-republican-group-lost-on-96-of-its-local-bets-in-latest-election/) discusses the Orange County Republican Party’s track record in the latest election cycle. The article also mentions that Fred Whitaker, the county Republican Party chairman, did not respond to a request for comment regarding the group’s election results.
Editorially, on issues such as climate, Voice of OC supports action to address climate change and promotes environmental justice
[“Taft: The Climate and Environmental Justice Movements are Building a Sustainable Future for Santa Ana”.](https://voiceofoc.org/2021/09/taft-the-climate-and-environmental-justice-movements-are-building-a-sustainable-future-for-santa-ana/)
Regarding sourcing, they rely on reliable sources, such as the
[LA Times (Los Angeles Times)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), and incorporate quotes into their reporting. The Voice of OC is generally fact-based and moderately left-leaning editorially.
