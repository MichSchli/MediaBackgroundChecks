History
Founded in 1984 by
[William W. Geimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Geimer), The Jamestown Foundation’s mission is to inform and educate policymakers and the broader community about events and trends in those societies which are strategically or tactically important to the United States and which frequently restrict access to such information. Its [primary focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamestown_Foundation) is on China, Eurasia, Russia, and global terrorism.
In 2009 Russian government accused the research institute of spreading anti-Russian propaganda by hosting a debate on violence in Russia’s turbulent region of
[Ingushetia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingushetia). On December 8, 2011, Ambassador [Daniel Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Benjamin), State Department Counterterrorism Coordinator for the Obama administration, praised Jamestown for its research and analysis of terrorism issues. Finally, in 2020 the organization was labeled [“undesirable”](https://news.yahoo.com/russia-moves-ban-undesirable-u-192411998.html) by Russia.
