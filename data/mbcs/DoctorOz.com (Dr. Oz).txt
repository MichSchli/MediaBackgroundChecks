History
[Mehmet Cengiz Öz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Oz), better known as Dr. Oz, is a Turkish-American cardiothoracic surgeon, Columbia University professor, author, and television personality. He is a proponent of [alternative medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/), and has been criticized by physicians, government officials, and publications for giving non-scientific advice and promoting pseudoscience. In 2014 the British Medical Journal examined over 400 medical or health recommendations from 40 episodes of his program and found that [only 46% of his claims were supported by reputable research](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/19/half-of-dr-ozs-medical-advice-is-baseless-or-wrong-study-says/?utm_term=.41c05ef1acea), while 15% of his claims contradicted medical research, and the remainder of Oz’s advice was either vague or unsupported by research.
In 2022, Doctoroz.com became his official campaign website for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.

Analysis / Bias
In review, both the Dr. Oz television show and his website routinely promote pseudoscience. Some examples are
[miracle weight loss products](https://www.livescience.com/48375-dr-oz-cited-bogus-study.html), [natural teeth whitening mixtures](https://www.livescience.com/48472-teeth-whitening-methods-really-work.html) that do not work, and [promotion](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) of [anti-GMO propaganda.](https://www.livescience.com/50576-dr-oz-miracle-claims.html) In 2012, Dr. Oz won James Randi’s “The [Pigasus Award](http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/2074-jrefs-pigasus-awards-honors-dubious-peddlers-of-woo.html) for Refusal to Face Reality” for his continued promotion of “quack medical practices, paranormal belief, and pseudoscience.” Further, Dr. Oz has promoted one of the worst purveyors of Pseudoscience, [Joseph Mercola](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/for-shame-dr-oz/) on his TV show.
As of early April 2020, Dr. Oz frequently appears on the Sean Hannity radio program (Far right-wing) promoting hydroxychloroquine to fight Covid-19. However, there is
[not sufficient evidence](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/chloroquine-and-hydroxychloroquine-current-evidence-for-their-effectiveness-in-treating-covid-19/) to prove its effectiveness or safety.
Currently, the website contains only information about his campaign. Dr. Oz is a republican candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump. This review covers the previous content on this website.
