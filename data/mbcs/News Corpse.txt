According to their [about page](https://www.newscorpse.com/ncWP/?page_id=1908) “The once-mighty 4th Estate has been consumed by a governmental-corporate complex whose interests are best served by a compliant media that obeys its masters.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The News Corpse website publishes news from other sources with some commentary added. There is the use of loaded emotional language such as this
[Trump Is Toast: Post-Convention Polls Show Biden’s Lead Growing](https://www.newscorpse.com/ncWP/?p=46526). This story is reasonably sourced to [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and [Real Clear Politics.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/) In another article that displays strong left bias [Trump Whines Because ‘Democrats Are Smiling’ – No, They’re Laughing at You, Loser](https://www.newscorpse.com/ncWP/?p=34261) there is again strong supporting evidence, but there is zero counter-argument to the claims. In general, the information provided is factual and sourced, however the omission of counter-argument is blatant.
