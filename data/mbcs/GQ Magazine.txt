Analysis / Bias
In review, GQ primarily reports on men’s fashion and lifestyle. They also occasionally report on politics with a left-leaning bias, such as this:
[Trump Promotes Conspiracy Theorist Who Says the President Is Like the “King of Israel.”](https://www.gq.com/story/trump-king-of-israel) This story is thoroughly sourced from credible publications such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/). When reporting on conservatives, there is frequent use of emotional language such as this: [How to Fix the Conservative Hijacking of the Supreme Court](https://www.gq.com/story/court-packing). Editorially, GQ favors [liberal policies](https://www.gq.com/story/aoc-sanders-consumer-credit-bill) and almost always reports negatively on the right.
