Analysis/ Bias
In the article
[“Latest Trump Indictment Sends U.S. to Uncharted Territory,”](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/news-commentary/latest-trump-indictment-sends-u-s-to-uncharted-territory/) Franciscan Media discusses [former President Donald Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) indictment, heavily relying on quotes from academics like Robert Schmuhl and James Patterson, as well as statements from the Justice Department. For instance, Robert Schmuhl asserts, ‘He portrays himself as the victim of politically driven investigations to prevent him from returning to the White House after the 2024 election,’ while James Patterson comments, ‘Trump’s argument almost writes itself.’ The phrase ‘uncharted territory’ describes the indictment’s impact on the U.S. While the article provides a balanced view by quoting experts from diverse fields, its emotionally loaded language and framing of Trump as a divisive figure may suggest a slight bias against him.
Another article,
[“Followers of St. Francis: Michael Blackburn, OFM,”](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/followers-of-st-francis-michael-blackburn-ofm/) profiles Father Michael Blackburn. It details his early life and calling to the priesthood, using a positive tone to highlight his commitment to Franciscan values. The piece is factual, relying on quotes from Father Michael, such as “God used that time to get my attention” and “God has been my strength,” and aligns with the publication’s religious focus. Side note: As of this review, we have not yet rated the credibility of OSV News. However, Franciscan Media frequently cites them as a source in several of their articles, including those covering political and religious topics.
Editorially, they generally hold traditional Catholic views, such as being morally opposed to abortion; however, they usually reject laws banning abortion, such as this
[Ohio archbishop urges Catholics to reject abortion amendment](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/news-commentary/ohio-archbishop-urges-catholics-to-reject-abortion-amendment/), and [Catholics oppose Alabama A.G. suggestion of prosecuting women over abortion pills](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/news-commentary/catholics-oppose-alabama-a-g-suggestion-of-prosecuting-women-over-abortion-pills/). Further, while supporting traditional marriage, they also support the LGBTQ community like this [Walking with the LGBTQ Community: An Interview with Jim Martin, SJ](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/st-anthony-messenger/june-july-2022/walking-with-the-lgbtq-community-an-interview-with-jim-martin-sj/).
Although most articles are factual, they do promote pseudoscience, such as belief in stigmata:
[Reflections on the Stigmata of St. Francis](https://www.franciscanmedia.org/franciscan-spirit-blog/a-friar-reflects-on-the-stigmata-of-st-francis/). There is [no evidence](https://skepdic.com/stigmata.html) stigmata is real. In general, news reporting is factual and has a slight left-leaning editorial bias; however, there is evidence that they lightly promote religious pseudoscience, as evidenced above.
