On its
[about page](https://www.expressen.se/om-expressen/welcome-to-expressen/), Expressen states its editorial position as “The political orientation of the editorial page is liberal.” However, [Liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberals_(Sweden)) are considered center-right in Sweden.
In review, Expressen’s front page features video clips as well as articles in a tabloid format. Articles are published with bold oversized text, big headlines, and large photos. Expressen frequently publishes articles with loaded emotional language in their headlines, such as in this article where they are critical of the former President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker:
[“Europe must have a leader who does not give up,”](https://www.expressen.se/ledare/ylva-nilsson/europa-maste-ha-en-ledare-som-inte-viker-sig/) and they are critical of the former left-leaning Prime Minister, [“This is not enough for a prime minister.”](https://www.expressen.se/ledare/patrik-kronqvist/det-har-duger-inte-for-en-statsminister/) This story also illustrates a strong right-wing bias by characterizing immigrants negatively.
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the former trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this article,
[“Trump is a sociopath – the world’s most dangerous man.”](https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/trump-ar-en-sociopat-varldens-farligaste-man/) Expressen typically utilizes credible sources such as [Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/).
