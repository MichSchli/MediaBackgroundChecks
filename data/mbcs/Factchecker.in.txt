Analysis / Bias
FactChecker.in fact-checks claims from various political parties and figures. It complies with the
[IFCN Code of Principles](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/application/public/factcheckerin/99CC6993-27A0-8531-CDD8-EE27B4DF5D14). We analyzed numerous fact-checks and selected two as examples, one examining Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim about the dropout rate in Gujarat schools, [“PM Modi’s Claim That Dropout Rate In Gujarat Schools Is Less Than 3% Is Partially True,”](https://www.factchecker.in/fact-check/pm-modis-claim-that-dropout-rate-in-gujarat-schools-is-less-than-3-is-partially-true-864348) and the other scrutinizing the Congress Party’s statement about farmers’ income [“Congress Party’s Claim about Farmers’ Income Is Incorrect.”](https://www.factchecker.in/fact-check/congress-partys-claim-about-farmers-income-is-incorrect-856574) In both cases, FactChecker.in employed a data-driven approach, utilizing government statistics and other reputable sources to assess the claims.
The organization maintains an objective tone in both fact checks, avoiding editorializing or using emotionally loaded words. They also reach out to the parties involved for comments.
FactChecker. in’s fact-checks do not show evidence of partisan bias. They scrutinize claims from both the ruling party (BJP) and the opposition (Congress), treating both with the same level of rigor and objectivity.
