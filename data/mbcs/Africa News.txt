History
Launched in 2016,
[Africanews](https://www.africanews.com/page/about/) is a pan-African TV channel that was based in [Pointe-Noire](https://www.africanews.com/page/pressroom/), Republic of the Congo. However, in [July 2020](https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2020/07/15/euronews-to-keep-african-service/), they moved the operation to Lyon, France, home to their parent organization Euronews. The channel and website feature sub-African and international news and business stories in French and English. Africanews also offers programs, live streaming, VOD, and interactive services on the internet. The news channel is a subsidiary of France-based [Euronews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/euronews/), which provides news from a European perspective. Michael Peters is the CEO of Euronews and Africanews. [Read our profile on France media and ownership.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-media-profile/)

Africanews is owned and was
[launched](https://www.euronews.com/2014/01/27/euronews-to-launch-africanews-the-first-pan-african-news-outlet) by [Euronews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/euronews/), which is [majority-owned (88%)](https://www.euronews.com/about) by Media Globe Networks, owned by [Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris.](https://variety.com/2020/biz/global/nbc-sells-25-stake-in-france-headquartered-broadcaster-euronews-1234585780/) Africanews revenue is derived from advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Africanews publishes articles with strong emotionally loaded language such as
[“Uganda: Troublemakers ‘will regret being born,’ police threaten voters,”](https://www.africanews.com/2021/01/08/uganda-troublemakers-will-regret-being-born-police-threaten-voters/) and “Hero’s [ welcome for Tanzanian opposition leader.”](https://www.africanews.com/2020/09/02/hero-s-welcome-for-tanzanian-opposition-leader/) Africanews states they have a network of correspondents across the continent; however, when you click on a journalist’s name who wrote the article, it goes to a broken link. For example, in this story titled [“Congo authorities battling with huge floods,”](https://www.africanews.com/2021/01/09/congo-authorities-battling-with-huge-floods/) the journalist’s name is [“Jerry Fisayo-Bambi,”](https://twitter.com/jerrybambi1) and his bio links to a Twitter account; however, the Twitter account does not exist. Some journalist names such as [“Ignatius Annor”](https://twitter.com/africanews) link directly to Africanews’ main Twitter page.
Africanews typically sources information through quotes rather than hyperlinks, such as in this article titled
[“Uganda: Troublemakers ‘will regret being born,’ police threaten voters”](https://www.africanews.com/2021/01/08/uganda-troublemakers-will-regret-being-born-police-threaten-voters//) where they use quotes and interviews “That’s an environment that does not facilitate a free and fair election,” Oryem Nyeko, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Uganda told Africanews.” [Oryem Nyeko](https://www.hrw.org/about/people/oryem-nyeko) is a researcher in the Africa division of [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/); however, Africanews didn’t link to his bio. Africanews covers world news through the [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), such as [“USA: Trump Admits Defeat After Congress Certifies Biden’s Victory.”](https://www.africanews.com/2021/01/07/usa-trump-admits-defeat-after-congress-certifies-biden-s-victory//)
Editorially, Africanews does not publish op-eds; however, they typically report news from a European perspective
[“France promise continued support to Burkina Faso in fight against extremism,”](https://www.africanews.com/2021/01/09/france-promise-continued-support-to-burkina-faso-in-fight-against-extremism/) and [German new museum ignites colonial controversy](https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/22/german-new-museum-ignites-colonial-controversy/). When reporting on United States politics, they tend to report negatively on former President Donald Trump, such as this [US Outgoing President Finally Signs Much-Needed $900 COVID Relief Bill](https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/28/us-outgoing-president-finally-signs-much-needed-900-covid-relief-bill/). They support the fight against [climate change,](https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/18/gabon-s-magroves-could-fight-climate-change-but-are-under-threat/) [gender equality](https://www.africanews.com/2020/11/24/namibian-governor-calls-for-action-against-gender-based-violence/), and [gay rights from an issues perspective.](https://www.africanews.com/2019/08/08/tunisia-s-first-openly-gay-aspiring-presidential-candidate/) The news is generally reported factually, though with poor sourcing and a left-leaning editorial bias.
