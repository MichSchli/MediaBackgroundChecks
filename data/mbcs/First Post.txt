Analysis / Bias
In review, First Post was originally considered left-leaning due to merging with the Indian edition of
[Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/). However, in 2022 they routinely favor conservative Prime Minister Modi and his BJP party with articles such as this [1,200 years of servitude: PM Modi offers food for thought](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/1200-years-of-servitude-pm-modi-offers-food-for-thought-1567805.html).
While covering USA political news, they provide links to their sources, which are credible mainstream media such as
[Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [WaPo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/); however, they also utilize strong loaded words in their headlines and articles such as: “ [Donald Trump: An incredibly indecent man, a poor orator and a failing president](http://www.firstpost.com/world/donald-trump-an-incredibly-indecent-man-a-poor-orator-and-a-failing-president-3348856.html).” In general, First Post offers left and right-leaning opinions; however, they rarely criticize and often praise conservative PM Modi and his ruling government.
