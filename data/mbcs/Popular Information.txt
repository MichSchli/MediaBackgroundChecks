Analysis / Bias
In review, the website and newsletter publish news and opinion content with a left-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines sometimes contain moderately loaded language such as this:
[The cover-up of the cover-up](https://popular.info/p/the-cover-up-of-the-cover-up). Most articles are strongly sourced from credible outlets and information like this: [An interview with the Ukrainians who created the “I Love America” Facebook page](https://popular.info/p/an-interview-with-the-ukrainians).
Editorially, Popular Information is liberal-progressive, with frequent negative reporting on conservatives and the former Trump administration, such as this,
[How the Trump campaign scams its supporters on Facebook](https://popular.info/p/how-the-trump-campaign-scams-its). In general, Popular Information is solidly left biased in both story selection and editorially, while usually properly sourced and factual.
