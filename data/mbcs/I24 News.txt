Analysis / Bias
In review, the i24 News website presents original news reporting with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[Microsoft: Iranian hackers targeted a US presidential campaign](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/americas/1570210215-microsoft-iranian-hackers-targeted-a-us-presidential-campaign). i24 News also publishes news from the [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), which is rated least biased.
Editorially, they previously covered both sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and covered US news with impartiality. When reporting on right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there is a slightly negative tone such as this:
[Netanyahu considers party primary to shore up leadership, shifts blame from Lapid to Gantz](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/politics/1570105402-netanyahu-accuses-gantz-of-trying-to-escape-public-mandate-to-form-unity-government).
However, during the 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict, i24 has reported favorably on the Israeli government and their actions and negatively on Palestine, such as this: “One of the commanders told me they saw babies’ heads cut off. soldiers told me they believe 40 babies, children were killed.” To date, this claim
[has not been verified](https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/nov/21/israel-hamas-war-what-we-know-about-beheaded-babie/).
Generally, news reporting is not always factual and sometimes unsubstantiated. Further, the network holds a pro-government bias that currently leans right.
