History
[Founded in 2010](http://gulagbound.com/) by [Arlen Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arlenwilliams/), Gulag Bound is a strongly right-leaning conspiracy website. According to their about page “There is much we have learned about the global Marxofascist insurrection — from the likes of George Soros, Maurice Strong, David Rockefeller, and from Ban Ki-moon’s U.N., down to the creeping control of our neighborhoods and lives by their insidious “sustainable development initiatives,” and so many other subversions.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Gulag Bound publishes original articles as well as links to other sources that promote a conspiratorial conservative perspective. Headlines and articles often contain emotionally loaded wording that favors the right such as this:
[Pritzker’s Tyranny with Churches in COVID-19 Illinois](http://gulagbound.com/60245/pritzkers-tyranny-with-churches-in-covid-19-illinois/). When it comes to sourcing they usually rely on far-right or questionable sources such as [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/), [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), and Red Pill University.
Editorially, Gulag Bound promotes anti-globalism propaganda such as this:
[Globalists Using COVID-19 to Usher UN Agenda 2030 ‘Brave New World’ Ten Years Ahead of Schedule](https://gulagbound.com/59838/globalists-using-covid-19-to-usher-un-agenda-2030-brave-new-world-ten-years-ahead-of-schedule/). They also frequently publish conspiracy theories such as those involving Bill and Melinda Gates: [Melinda Gates: (Perilous) COVID-19 Vaccines Must Go to Blacks and People of Color Before Whites](http://gulagbound.com/60693/melinda-gates-perilous-covid-19-vaccines-must-go-to-blacks-and-people-of-color-before-whites/comment-page-1/#comment-1405357). In general this a strong right-wing conspiracy website.
