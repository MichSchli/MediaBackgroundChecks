Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Conservative has argued against American interventionism, against a debt-based fiscal policy, and against the intrusions on Americans’ private lives by the institutions and mores that exist and the wisdom that underlies them. The American Conservative is a very well-written source with a libertarian perspective.
The American Conservative presents news and opinions with moderately loaded language:
[What Happens When Kim Stands Trump Up at the Altar?](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/what-happens-when-kim-stands-trump-up-at-the-altar/) This story is very well sourced to [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [National Interest](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-interest/). Although they are always opposed to [Democratic Socialism,](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/socialism-will-always-destroy-democracy/) they also frequently [report negatively on President Trump](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/trumps-immoral-iran-policy/), especially as it relates to foreign policy. When it comes to science, The American Conservative supports the consensus of science with articles such as this: [A Judgement By Fire](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/global-warming-judgement-by-fire/).
While they do not support a New Green Deal’s progressive agenda, they acknowledge that action must be taken, albeit with a more free-market approach. Regardless of solutions, TAC supports the consensus of science. However, during the 2020 Presidential election, they have promoted election fraud information contrary to the findings of election experts. The article
[Memorandum: How The 2020 Election Could Have Been Stolen](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-2020-election-what-happened-a-political-scientists-memorandum/?fbclid=IwAR2e9JK5GJJ4dp9Vhu_wIUhkAaXyW0l7ne_1q7w51gi5R7lxCy1JQsnLIrI) does not produce a single link to outside sources to verify the author’s opinions.
Editorially, they support limited government, limited military presence in other countries, and general nationalism. In other words, this is a libertarian/paleo-conservative organization. They generally publish mostly opinion-based content that is mostly factual but sometimes uses poor sourcing techniques.
