History
[Founded in 2015](https://whois.domaintools.com/southfront.org), South Front is a Russian propaganda website that claims to be non-profit and non-partisan. According to their [about page](https://southfront.org/about-southfront/), South Front is a “public analytical umbrella organization created and maintained by a team of experts and volunteers from the four corners of the Earth. SouthFront focuses on issues of international relations, armed conflicts, and crises. The organization provides military operations analysis, military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not name an owner or editors and articles lack author names and bios.
In 2016, South Front was
[accused](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12290-016-0395-5) of being a Russian propaganda tool. In another 2016 article, they were [accused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/russian-propaganda-effort-helped-spread-fake-news-during-election-experts-say/2016/11/24/793903b6-8a40-4ca9-b712-716af66098fe_story.html) of “spreading Russian propaganda during the [U.S.] election.” Finally, in 2017, their Wikipedia page was [deleted](https://southfront.org/wikipedia-entry-on-southfront-was-deleted/) due to being a non-reliable source.

Analysis / Bias
In review, South Front provides an analysis of battles and conflicts, evaluates the major world power armed forces, and studies tensions between countries from a Russian perspective. Articles are published anonymously and typically do not use loaded emotional headlines such as this
[LOCAL FIGHTERS KILLED, INJURED IN TWO SEPARATE ATTACKS IN SYRIA’S DARAA](https://southfront.org/local-fighters-killed-injured-in-two-separate-attacks-in-syrias-daraa/). This story does not source to an outside source.
According to
[EU VS Disinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/south-front-russia-hiding-being-russian/), South Front frequently publishes false or misleading Russian Propaganda. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, they published highly propagandistic articles such as this [BREAKING: RUSSIA LAUNCHED PEACE ENFORCEMENT OPERATION IN UKRAINE](https://southfront.org/breaking-russia-launched-peace-enforcement-operation-in-ukraine/). While people may have differing perspectives on the invasion, a peace mission is not a perspective most would hold. This is a Russian propaganda website.
