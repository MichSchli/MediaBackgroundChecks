Analysis / Bias
Conservative Tears indicates they are satire through their tagline displayed on every page that reads “Death Hoaxes for your Thoughts and Prayers. In general, this is a satire website that pokes fun at conservatives who believe and share the stories. Most stories on Conservative Tears are death hoaxes on people who identify as conservative or support former President Trump
[Trump’s Attorney Sidney “The Kraken” Powell Dead at Age 69](https://conservativetears.com/2021/04/19/trumps-attorney-sidney-the-kraken-powell-dead-at-age-69/). Needless to say, Sidney Powell is not dead.
A quote from the article reads: “Powell’s estranged daughter issued a statement: “I haven’t spoken to my mother since she went off the rails and became a Cult 45 Kool-Aid guzzling nut job. She used to be kind of OK, except for her taste in sweaters and the people she associates with and her willingness to spread crazy conspiracy theories, and her desire to poop on the Constitution. I’m sure someone will blame her sudden death on Hillary Clinton. That’ll be funny.”
The website again displays on their
[about page](https://bustatroll.org/about-us/) that they are satire: “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie, and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental, and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you’re still having an issue with that satire thing.”
Although this site and all of Christopher Blair’s properties disclaim they are satire, they are still frequently fact-checked by fact-checkers.
