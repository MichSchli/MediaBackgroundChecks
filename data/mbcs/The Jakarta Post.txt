In review, in the 2014 elections, The Jakarta Post endorsed Center-Left Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo
[“Editorial: Endorsing Jokowi](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/07/04/editorial-endorsing-jokowi.html),” stating, “There is no such thing as being neutral when the stakes are so high.” However, they still publish editorials that are critical of ‘Jokowi’s’ ruling center-left party PDI-P, such as [“Challenge from within.”](https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/01/27/challenge-from-within.html) A quote from the article reads, “the last few years witnessed how the PDI-P has struggled to live up to its name.” They continue, “Surely the PDI-P is now at its peak performance. Unless it resists the temptation to hold onto power through “undemocratic” means, we might see the party’s collapse sooner or later.” Furthermore, the article poorly sources its claims. The Jakarta Post also covers Airlangga Hartarto positively (The Chairman of the center-right [Golkar Party](https://carnegieendowment.org/2013/10/24/indonesia-s-political-parties-pub-53414) and also Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs President of Indonesia Joko Widodo’s cabinet): [“It’s official: Airlangga reelected to Golkar’s top post.”](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/05/its-official-airlangga-reelected-to-golkars-top-post.html)
Regarding political issues, particularly in regard to West Papua, the Jakarta Post reports with a balanced tone,
[“Protests demanding release of seven Papuan activists continue as verdict trials near.”](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/15/protests-demanding-release-of-seven-papuan-activists-continue-as-verdict-trials-near.html) Although The Jakarta Post covers world news about the USA, through the [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), they also publish opinion pieces that are critical in a tone such as [“It’s official: Indonesia has arrived at its Trumpian moment](https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2019/10/02/its-official-indonesia-has-arrived-at-its-trumpian-moment.html).” Regarding sourcing, The Jakarta Post typically sources itself and uses quotes. In general, they report news factually with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
