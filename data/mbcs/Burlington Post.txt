[‘So scary’: Suspected impaired driver in Burlington neighbourhood caught on video and residents are reacting](https://www.insidehalton.com/news-story/10629748--so-scary-suspected-impaired-driver-in-burlington-neighbourhood-caught-on-video-and-residents-are-reacting/). The national news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
