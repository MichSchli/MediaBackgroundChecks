Based in Cyprus, the website’s editor is [Alexander Mercouris,](https://theduran.com/author/alexander/) who in 2012 was disbarred as an attorney in London. [According](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/07/28/pro-putin-commentator-faces-prospect-fraud-charges-yard-admits/) to the [Telegraph,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/) he then went on to become a “pro-Russian commentator on world affairs for Russian TV news outlets and websites.”
The Duran’s director is
[Peter Lavelle,](https://theduran.com/author/peter/) the host of [RT’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) (Russian state news outlet) political debate program [CrossTalk](https://www.rt.com/shows/crosstalk/). [In 2018](https://www.weeklystandard.com/holmes-lybrand/how-the-russian-propaganda-machine-turns-out-seriously-fake-news), the right-leaning [Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/) accused The Duran of peddling Russian “Fake News.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Duran publishes news and opinions with a conservative and pro-Russian perspective, such as this:
[Roger Stone Shines New Light on Russia-Gate Hoax](https://theduran.com/roger-stone-shines-new-light-on-russia-gate-hoax/). This story is copied and pasted directly from the pro-Russian [Strategic Culture Foundation](https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2019/05/21/roger-stone-shines-new-light-on-russia-gate-hoax/). However, all articles involving Russia are generally positively slanted, such as [Russia Grinds Out Wins In Europe](https://theduran.com/russia-grinds-out-wins-in-europe/) and [Trump boxed in on Iran, as Putin holds key to prevent war in Persian Gulf (Video)](https://theduran.com/trump-boxed-in-on-iran-as-putin-holds-key-to-prevent-war-in-persian-gulf-video/). In addition, many articles are poorly sourced from Russian Propaganda outlets such as [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) and [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/).
When covering the USA, the Duran demonstrates a conservative bias with frequent articles denigrating the left such as this:
[Rudy Giuliani DESTROYS Hillary Clinton, “America’s Number One Crime Family” (Video)](https://theduran.com/rudy-giuliani-destroys-hillary-clinton-americas-number-one-crime-family-video/), and this story promoting a conspiracy theory, [NXIVM Sex-Cult Prosecutors Have Evidence Of Illegal Clinton Campaign Contributions For “Political Influence](https://theduran.com/nxivm-sex-cult-prosecutors-have-evidence-of-illegal-clinton-campaign-contributions-for-political-influence/).” This last story is copied and pasted from the right-wing conspiracy website [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/).
In general, The Duran routinely publishes pro-Russian propaganda and promotes right-wing conspiracies through the use of poorly sourced, plagiarized news articles.
