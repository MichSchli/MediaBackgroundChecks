Analysis / Bias
In review, the Australian National Review promotes pseudoscience, such as
[anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and [anti-gmo propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). In addition to these, they also publish conspiracy theories such as those involving [ChemTrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/). In many cases, they source from other conspiracy and pseudoscience websites, such as [Food Babe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/food-babe/) and [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). In general, this is a strongly rated conspiracy and pseudoscience website that is low for factual information.
The Australian National Review has also promoted misinformation and conspiracy theories regarding covid-19, as demonstrated below in our failed fact checks.
