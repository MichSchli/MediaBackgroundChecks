Analysis / Bias
Ria Novosti presents news in line with the Russian Government’s narrative and has been criticized for publishing
[misleading and false information](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2022/03/09/tiktok-russia-ukraine-misinformation-ria-novosti-ban-putin/?sh=7ee249dd7ad3) by [American](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/magazine/rt-sputnik-and-russias-new-theory-of-war.html) and [European ](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60562240)media outlets.
In review, RIA Novosti uses loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this:
[“SBU began hunting for those wishing to evacuate from Ukraine to Russia’”](https://ria.ru/20220312/okhota-1777877236.html) and [“A rally in support of Russia was held in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”](https://ria.ru/20220312/podderzhka-1777856496.html) When it comes to sourcing, Ria Novosti occasionally uses credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and [CNN.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/)
Editorially, RIA is a propaganda arm of the Russian Government, with all stories reporting favorably on Russia and President Putin. Due to their promotion of propaganda, they have made dozens of false claims. See below for a shortlist of failed fact checks. In general, RIA Novosti holds a right-leaning bias and lacks credibility due to the promotion of state propaganda.
