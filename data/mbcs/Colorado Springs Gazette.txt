National and international news comes almost exclusively from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). All information is properly sourced either through links or first-person accounting.
Editorially, the Colorado Gazette almost always endorses Republican candidates, as evidenced by their 2018 endorsements:

A review of editorial stories demonstrates that most favor the right, with many coming from the Right-leaning [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/). An example of a right-leaning editorial is as follows: [EDITORIAL: Progressive goals mean huge middle-class taxes](https://gazette.com/premium/editorial-progressive-goals-mean-huge-middle-class-taxes/article_98646770-626e-11ea-806e-9b9dc84425c8.html). Generally, news reporting is factual, while editorial opinion pieces consistently favor the right.
