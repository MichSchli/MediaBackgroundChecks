Analysis / Bias
In review, the Meriden Record-Journal covers local news, crime, sports, and business through reporters for the central Connecticut region. Local news reporting is free of loaded emotional language such as this
[Southington finance board votes to send golf course contract to voters](https://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Southington/Southington-News/Southington-finance-board-recommends-golf-course-development-rights-purchase). The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) primarily covers national and international.
Editorially, op-eds generally focus on local issues with a reasonable balance of opinions. Articles in the Opinion section are also not overtly biased, such as this
[EDITORIAL: Wallingford again eyes advertising in parks](https://www.myrecordjournal.com/Opinion/Editorials/EditorialAdverts-rj-020921.html). In general, the news is reported factually and with low bias.
