Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the site it is apparent that Herman Cain does not really write for his blog. The primary writer and publisher of news on the website are Dan Calabrese who is a journalist, columnist, and adult Bible study teacher. In general, HermanCain.com only reports news that is favorable to conservative causes and negative toward liberal ones. Mr. Calabrese uses moderate loaded words in his writing and sometimes utilizes sources that are questionable. Although there aren’t any direct fact checks of HermanCain.com, there is ample evidence of many
[false claims](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/herman-cain/) by Herman Cain. Dan Calabrese, then with a different media group has also made a [false claim](http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/zeifman.asp) in 2008.
