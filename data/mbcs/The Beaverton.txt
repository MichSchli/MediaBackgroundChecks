Analysis / Bias
In review, the Beaverton fully discloses they are satirical on every page of the website through their disclaimer, which reads: “The Beaverton is a news satire and parody publication. All articles contained within this website and on its social media accounts, however similar to real events, are fictitious. When public figures or actual businesses are mentioned by name, the corresponding story details are invented. In all other cases, any resemblance to actual persons, businesses, or events is entirely coincidental.”
A sample satire story reads as follows:
[“Thank god for service workers” says man who will oppose minimum wage hike in 9 months](https://www.thebeaverton.com/2020/04/thank-god-for-service-workers-says-man-who-will-oppose-minimum-wage-hike-in-9-months/). In general, this is a very clear satire site that disclaims as such.
