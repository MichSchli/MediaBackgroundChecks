Funded by / Ownership
KATU-TV is owned by the
[Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sinclair-broadcast-group/), which is a publicly-traded American telecommunications company that is controlled by the family of company founder [Julian Sinclair Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Sinclair_Smith). The company is the largest television station operator in the United States by the number of stations, and largest by total coverage; owning or operating a total of 193 stations across the country in over 100 markets (covering 40% of American households), many of which are located in the South and Midwest.
Sinclair has been scrutinized by multiple media outlets for consistently favoring conservative politics. They are considered a
[rival to right biased Fox News](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/business/dealbook/sinclair-media-expansion-fox-conservative-media.html?_r=0) for the conservative audience. [The Seattle Times](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020756844_fishersinclairxml.html) has written a piece documenting Sinclair’s right-leaning bias. Further, according to the [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), the Sinclair Broadcast Group has [donated](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000029062&cycle=2016) approximately 80% to Republican candidates since 1994.
Finally, in March 2018, Sinclair ordered its stations to produce promos with an “anchor delivered journalistic responsibility message” dictated by the company.
[The wording of the mandated script](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html) was criticized by some station news staff and outside pundits for its discussion of “fake news,” with some critics arguing that the message used similar language and rhetoric to Donald Trump. [Trump responded](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/980799183425802240?lang=en) to the promos on April 2, 2018, defending the company as being “far superior to [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and even more Fake [NBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), which is a total joke.”
Advertising generates revenue.
