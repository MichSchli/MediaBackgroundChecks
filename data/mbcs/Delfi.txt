Analysis / Bias
The first article analyzed discusses Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda’s support for
[Hungary’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hungary-media-profile/) controversial law restricting LGBTQ content for minors. This hot-button issue has drawn [criticism](https://www.euractiv.com/section/non-discrimination/news/portrayal-and-promotion-hungarys-latest-anti-lgbt-law-explained/) from various EU countries. For instance, the article titled [“President stands up for Hungary in a row over controversial LGBTQ law.”](https://www.delfi.lt/en/politics/president-stands-up-for-hungary-in-row-over-controversial-lgbtq-law-87552717) While the article’s body maintains a neutral tone, the title’s phrase “stands up for Hungary” is emotionally loaded, implying a form of moral or ethical support for Hungary’s controversial law. The article is framed to focus on the President’s comments and the EU leaders’ meeting without offering counter-perspectives or discussing the implications of the law itself. The article is accurate but lacks a balanced perspective, as it does not include opinions from those opposing the law or the President’s stance.
The second article is a fact-checking piece that debunks a misleading headline about Lithuania’s Prime Minister, Ingrida Šimonytė, allegedly stating that many people would die after receiving COVID-19 vaccinations:
[“No, Šimonytė did not say that “a lot of people will die after vaccination.”](https://www.delfi.lt/news/melo-detektorius/melas/ne-simonyte-nesake-kad-po-skiepu-mirs-labai-daug-zmoniu.d?id=87081019) The language is neutral and factual, aiming to correct misinformation. The article is framed as a fact-check, providing evidence to debunk the misleading information and cites sources such as The Baltic News Service (BNS); however, the hyperlink to BNS leads to a general topic page on Delfi without showing the specific report mentioned in the article.
Delfi also strongly opposes the Russian invasion of
[Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/interfax-ukraine-bias/) with articles such as [“Opinion: Ukraine’s success threatens Russian idea of exclusivity.”](https://www.delfi.lt/en/politics/opinion-ukraine-s-success-threatens-russian-idea-of-exclusivity-65283286/comments) [Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-europe-radio-liberty/) states that [Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) has [blocked](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-blocks-delfi-news-website/31770852.html) Delfi.
