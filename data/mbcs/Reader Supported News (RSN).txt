Analysis / Bias
Reader Supported News publishes news stories from primarily left-leaning sources such as
[Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), [Ecowatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ecowatch/), [Think Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/think-progress/), and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Some of the sources used for republishing we have rated as factually mixed. Reader Supported News also publishes original news stories that typically favor the left through story selection and wording. An example headline with significant loaded language is as follows: [Ignore The Twitter Twit & Go Strategic](http://readersupportednews.org/pm-section/444-occupy/47803-ignore-the-twitter-twit-a-go-strategic).
This updated review of more than a dozen recent stories aligns with the left, such as this
[DC Attorney General Sues Proud Boys, Oath Keepers Over Jan. 6 Attack](https://www.rsn.org/001/dc-attorney-general-sues-proud-boys-oath-keepers-over-jan-6-attack.html). In general, the news reporting on RSN is reasonably factual, but they sometimes rely on poor sources that fail fact checks.
