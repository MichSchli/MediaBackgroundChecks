Analysis / Bias
In review, The Nevada Independent primarily reports on issues and politics for the state of Nevada. There is minimal use of loaded language in news headlines such as this:
[Former deputy files another lawsuit against embattled Storey County sheriff](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/former-deputy-files-another-lawsuit-against-embattled-storey-county-sheriff). Information within articles is always sourced and in the case of the article listed above, it is sourced to court documents. Story selection tends to favor the left, with some articles favoring left-leaning political positions such as [clean energy](https://thenevadaindependent.com/articles/energy) and [pro-immigration.](https://thenevadaindependent.com/articles/immigration) However, most of these reports provide some balance through counterpoints.
Opinion pieces also tend to slightly
[favor the left](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/hof-a-symptom-of-nevada-gops-greater-dysfunction-in-the-time-of-trump) and do utilize loaded words such as this: “Talk about nonsense personified. But that’s Nevada’s Republican Party in the time of Trump. Not so long ago, a man who made a living running a stable of prostitutes might have thanked his lucky stars he was a pimp in one of the few places in America that it’s legal. But having pledged blind loyalty to the erratic charlatan in the White House, anything goes.”
They also provide balance by having conservative-leaning op-eds such as this:
[Background checks and the danger of absurd political expectations](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/background-checks-and-the-danger-of-absurd-political-expectations). In general, news reporting is balanced, with editorials slightly leaning left in the number.
