Analysis / Bias
In review, We Are Change publishes news and commentary from a right-leaning perspective that is often conspiratorial. Articles and headlines use loaded emotional headlines such as this
[JEFFREY TOOBIN FIRED FROM NEW YORKER FOR JERKING OFF DURING ZOOM CALL](https://wearechange.org/jeffrey-toobin-fired-from-new-yorker-for-jerking-off-during-zoom-call/). Other articles contain headlines such as this [BIDEN WILL HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE, INTERSECTIONAL CABINET OF MASS MURDERERS EVER ASSEMBLED](https://wearechange.org/biden-will-have-the-most-diverse-intersectional-cabinet-of-mass-murderers-ever-assembled/). While the intent of this article is to highlight a pro-war perspective of the Democratic party, which is a fair debate, the headline itself is divisive and clickbait.
Further, according to the
[SPLC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) “We Are Change (WAC) is an organization that likes to quote Martin Luther King Jr., Einstein, Gandhi, and others talking about the evils of war. It describes itself as a nonviolent “citizens-based grassroots peace and social justice movement” and reacted angrily this year when the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) categorized it as part of the conspiracy-obsessed, [antigovernment “Patriot” movement](https://www.splcenter.org/20090801/second-wave-return-militias). WAC’s leader, [Luke Rudkowski](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/meet-patriots?page=0%2C2%2C%5D), complained at the time that the SPLC said nothing of WAC’s alleged “raising money for 9/11 first responders, toy drives during the holidays, clothing drives and feeding the homeless.” This source generally provides a mix of real news and speculation that is often sensationalized and not always factual.
