[Uprooting Insecurity](https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2023/02/uprooting-insecurity-brown-political-review/),” which discusses food insecurity in Black U.S. communities due to enduring racial inequalities.

Another article, titled
[“Rethinking the History of the Free Market: An Interview with Jacob Soll,”](https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2023/05/rethinking-the-history-of-the-free-market-an-interview-with-jacob-soll/) presents an interview with Jacob Soll, a professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California. Soll shares his views on the history of free-market thought, the role of the state in economic development, and the influence of historical figures like Jean-Baptiste Colbert and Adam Smith. In terms of bias, the interview mainly showcases Soll’s viewpoint, contesting traditional narratives about the free market and the state’s role. Soll argues that the idea of a self-regulating market with minimal government intervention is a “bizarre ideology” and a “myth” perpetuated in the United States.
