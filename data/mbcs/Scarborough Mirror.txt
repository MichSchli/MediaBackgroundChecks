In review, Scarborough Mirror uses low-biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Scarborough building heavily damaged in explosion](https://www.toronto.com/news/scarborough-building-heavily-damaged-in-explosion/article_bd672a38-63d3-579b-b2f1-dfbe46e974e5.html). National news is derived from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
