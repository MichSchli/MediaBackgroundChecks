Analysis / Bias
Heritage Daily publishes articles about Paleontology, Paleoanthropology, and news about the latest archaeological findings from across the globe.
In review, some articles are republished or aggregated from credible sources such as the University of Reading:
[“FORGOTTEN ‘LOWBURY WOMAN’ BURIAL TO REVEAL HER SECRETS”](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2023/03/forgotten-lowbury-woman-burial-to-reveal-her-secrets/146321) and Brown University such as [“EVIDENCE OF BRONZE AGE CRANIAL SURGERY FOUND AT ANCIENT MEGIDDO.” ](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2023/02/evidence-of-bronze-age-cranial-surgery-found-at-ancient-megiddo/146270)
Heritage Daily also publishes opinion pieces on archaeological topics, such as
[“SUSTAINABILITY OF THE NILE SINCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ASWAN DAM.”](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2022/08/sustainability-of-the-nile-since-the-construction-of-the-aswan-dam/144511) This article does not provide any hyperlinks. Furthermore, some pieces are republished, such as [“50,000-YEAR-OLD STONE TOOLS WERE MADE BY MONKEYS,”](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2022/12/50000-year-old-stone-tools-were-made-by-monkeys/145671) which provides a link for the source at the bottom of the article, but that does not work.
Under the travel section, Heritage Daily publishes articles focusing on places of historical interest, such as
[“SOKNOPAIOU NESOS – THE CROCODILE CULT TEMPLE.”](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2022/01/soknopaiou-nesos-the-crocodile-cult-temple/142466) A quote from the article reads, “Papyrological evidence suggests that Soknopaiou Nesos was abandoned around AD 230, although the reason for this is not entirely clear. It may have succumbed to a loss in pilgrim revenue over its remote location or possibly from a dwindling interest in the cult worship of Soknopaios.” There were no hyperlinks throughout the article.
Editorially, they focus on Archaeology and related news with minimal opinions added; however, the lack of appropriate sourcing lowers their credibility.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years
We rate Heritage Daily as least biased based on story selection and minimal editorializing of information. We also rate them as Mostly Factual rather than High due to poor sourcing techniques and a lack of transparency with ownership. (M. Huitsing 3/7/2022)
