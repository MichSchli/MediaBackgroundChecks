Analysis / Bias
In review, Thought Catalog claims they are a place for “thoughtful storytelling.” The website’s content primarily focuses on relationships, beauty tips, mental health, astrology, and creepy entertainment. Stories are often written with attention-grabbing headlines, providing information in list form such as this:
[10 Things People Don’t Realize You’re Doing Because You Have An Invisible Illness](https://thoughtcatalog.com/kim-quindlen/2016/12/10-things-people-dont-realize-youre-doing-because-you-have-an-invisible-illness/). Like most, this story is written in the first-person format and does not contain a single source link to validate the information. In another story, [This Is How You Heal Your Deepest Trauma And Finally Start To Live Your Life Again](https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2019/07/this-is-how-you-heal-your-deepest-trauma-and-finally-start-to-live-your-life-again/), there is zero sourcing to support claims.
Thought Catalog also frequently promotes pseudoscience such as
[Astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/): [What You’ve Been Doing Vs. What You Need To Do To Move On Based On Your Zodiac Sign](https://thoughtcatalog.com/lacey-ramburger/2019/01/what-youve-been-doing-vs-what-you-need-to-do-to-move-on-based-on-your-zodiac-sign/) and promoting miracles [10 People Who’ve Experienced A Real Miracle Explain Exactly What Happened](https://thoughtcatalog.com/dr-dakota-fox/2016/08/10-people-whove-experienced-a-real-miracle-explain-exactly-what-happened/).
Politically, Thought Catalog presents a negative view of the former Trump administration:
