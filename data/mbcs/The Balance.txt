Analysis / Bias
In review, when reporting on political issues related to economics, The Balance maintains neutrality and presents both sides of the argument. For example, in the article
[Donald Trump on Immigration, Pros, and Cons of His Policies](https://www.thebalance.com/donald-trump-immigration-impact-on-economy-4151107), The Balance looks at both sides and fairly presents its arguments. This article is also perfectly sourced from credible media outlets and sources such as [Whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), and [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/). In general, The Balance is actually quite balanced in reporting and mostly sticks to its expertise of reporting on finance and investing.
