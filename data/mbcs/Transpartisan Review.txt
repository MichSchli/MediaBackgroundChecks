History
Transpartisan Review (TR), founded by
[A. Lawrence Chickering](http://www.transpartisanreview.org/about-us/) and James S. Turner, is an online magazine for transpartisan political belief. Akin to Third Way politics and centrism in some respects, transpartisan politics eschews a left or right view and promotes cooperation from all sides; left, right, center, etc., to find solutions instead. The editor is Andy Fluke. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
A. Lawrence Chickering and James S. Turner appear to be the owners, but this is not clear. The website lacks transparency as it does not disclose how they are funded.
Analysis / Bias
The Transpartisan Review holds the position that there can be cooperation between left and right. Articles often reflect this, such as this
[Unite America Responds to the Capitol Riot](http://www.transpartisanreview.org/unite_america_on_riot/). This story is sourced from the right by [Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/) and the Left by [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Many of the stories are opinion or analysis pieces, and there is a true effort to represent both sides. In 2017, during their initial review by Dennis Kelly, he concluded, “The articles in TR are factual and well-sourced, and the only bias evident is towards the transpartisan belief.” In 2021, we see the same consistency and maintain a least biased rating but offer concern due to a lack of transparency.
