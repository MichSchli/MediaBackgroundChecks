Analysis / Bias
In review, Liberty Nation produces articles and information that strongly favors conservative politics. There is the moderate use of loaded language that favors the right, such as this:
[DEMS ON SOCIALISM: IGNORANCE AND ANGER.](https://www.libertynation.com/dems-on-socialism-ignorance-and-anger/) Liberty Nation utilizes poor sources on our questionable list, such as [CNS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/), which has a very poor track record with fact-checkers.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, they were opposed to lockdown measures but did not promote misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccines. However, when reporting on alleged election fraud in the 2020 election, they did not hesitate to report on
[allegations](https://www.libertynation.com/america-unites-over-election-fraud/) despite no evidence supporting them. In general, most content is fact-based but highly one-sided and biased in favor of the right.
