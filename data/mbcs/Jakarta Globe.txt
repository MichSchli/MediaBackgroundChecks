Analysis / Bias
The Jakarta Globe targets a diverse audience, and its editorial focus leans towards an international or business-oriented perspective. However, covering international politics, it primarily presents events from an Indonesian viewpoint. For example, the article “
[Indonesia Responds to Israel Blocking Its OECD Membership”](https://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesia-responds-to-israel-blocking-its-oecd-membership) examines Indonesia’s reaction to [Israel’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/) objection to its OECD membership bid, emphasizing geopolitical complexities, diplomatic stances, and issues surrounding [Palestine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/palestine-government-and-media-profile/) and economic development.
Acknowledging that Indonesian media, like the Jakarta Globe, may exhibit political bias due to ownership and the broader
[political climate](https://eastasiaforum.org/2023/12/16/indonesias-increasingly-opposition-less-democracy/) is essential. The Jakarta Globe’s owning conglomerate includes a former cabinet minister [(Enggartiasto Lukita),](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/24/indonesia-minister-on-concluding-rcep-trade-deal-with-all-16-countries.html) which may influence editorial coverage to align with specific interests.
Furthermore, Jakarta Globe consistently covers President Jokowi in a positive light, which is exemplified in articles such as
[“President Jokowi Reflects on 2023 and Looks Ahead to a Promising 2024”](https://jakartaglobe.id/news/president-jokowi-reflects-on-2023-and-looks-ahead-to-a-promising-2024) and [“Jokowi Rumored to Switch Parties to PAN.”](https://jakartaglobe.id/news/jokowi-rumored-to-switch-parties-to-pan) In these pieces, the President is portrayed positively, emphasizing his optimistic outlook for Indonesia and active engagement with the public. The articles explore his political strategies and actions without presenting alternative viewpoints or criticism indicative of a favorable media portrayal. Regarding sourcing, The Jakarta Globe primarily relies on extensive quotes from officials and rarely incorporates external hyperlinks for sourcing.
In general, the Jakarta Globe’s ownership by a media conglomerate with political ties and the nature of the Indonesian media landscape implies potential influences on its editorial stance, which includes positive coverage of President Jokowi, aligning with the prevailing political climate and interests of the conglomerate.
