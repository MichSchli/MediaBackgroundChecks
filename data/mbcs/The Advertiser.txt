Analysis / Bias
According to
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/01/election-editorials-overwhelmingly-endorse-malcolm-turnbull-and-coalition), The Adelaide Advertiser’s editorials endorsed the conservative coalition in previous elections. The Advertiser/Adelaide Now publishes sensational crime stories such as “ [Sadistic Adelaide couples jailed over harrowing torture of young babysitter, 19](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/law-order/sadistic-adelaide-couples-jailed-over-harrowing-torture-of-young-babysitter-19/news-story/254c573ff208ee3b02375cc1af521c08)” and gossip/entertainment columns such as “ [The Bachelorette – Sophie’s Toy Boys](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/television/james-weir-recaps-the-bachelorette-australia-2017-episode-1/news-story/cd0e803c51ef78dd6d59cf40552fa181).”
The Advertiser frequently uses loaded language in their headlines and articles that are strongly biased toward conservative causes through story selection such as “
[Give Migrants Bush jobs locals don’t want”](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/push-to-make-it-easier-for-migrants-to-come-to-australia-and-take-hardtofill-jobs-in-regional-areas/news-story/c01ef27b823423690ab8a7aa09ffdc70) and [“Andrew Bolt: Ten reasons the Left are morons](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/andrew-bolt-ten-reasons-the-left-are-morons/news-story/74442084e14245e372605fb60e1ebffa).” They also use factually mixed sources such as [The Daily Telegraph (Australia)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-telegraph-australia/). Some articles can only be accessed by subscription; therefore, we couldn’t read a great variety of articles.
