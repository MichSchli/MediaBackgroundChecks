History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/rairfoundation.com), the RAIR Foundation USA (Rise Align Ignite Reclaim) is an anonymously owned and published conservative news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://rairfoundation.com/about/), RAIR is “a grassroots activist organization comprised of everyday Americans leading a movement to reclaim our Republic from the network of individuals and organizations waging war on Americans, our Constitution, our borders and our Judeo-Christian values.”
The website lacks transparency as they don’t disclose their location, name editors, or clearly describe ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
RAIR Foundation lacks transparency as they do not openly disclose ownership. One must navigate to their
[Terms of Service](https://rairfoundation.com/terms-of-service/) page to see RAIR Foundation USA, LLC, owns them. Donations and an online store that sells branded merchandise generate revenue. As a foundation, you would expect financial disclosures, but they do not provide them.
Analysis / Bias
The RAIR Foundation USA is a conservative activist group that promotes news commentary from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines often feature highly emotional wording such as this
[EXPOSED: Doctors Receive ‘Perverse’ Monetary Incentives to Vaccinate,’ Hush Money’ Paid to Victims’ Families](https://rairfoundation.com/exposed-doctors-receive-perverse-monetary-incentives-to-vaccinatehush-money-paid-to-victims-families/). The article’s author claims she is an Investigative Journalist: Banned in parts of Europe, Wanted by Islamic countries, Threatened by terror groups, Hunted by left-wing media, Smeared by Hollywood elites & Fake religious leaders.)
Editorially, all stories and opinions favor the far-right through fear-based articles concerning communism such as this
[EXPOSED: Biden to Install ‘Bolshevik’ Saule Omarova to Nationalize Banks (Video)](https://rairfoundation.com/exposed-biden-to-install-bolshevik-saule-omarova-to-nationalize-banks-video/). RAIR is also afraid of immigrants, especially those who are Muslim, as they often promote only negative stories such as this [Muslim Mafia: Migrant Clans Conquer Sweden – Arab War Zone (Videos)](https://rairfoundation.com/muslim-mafia-migrant-clans-conquer-sweden-arab-war-zone-videos/). Finally, since the Covid-19 vaccines have been available, they have promoted false and misleading anti-vaccination propaganda. See failed fact checks below.
In general, RAIR claims to be a foundation; however, with a complete lack of transparency with the people involved, financial disclosures, and ownership, it is best to describe them as an imposter site posing as a foundation.
