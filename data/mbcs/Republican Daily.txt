Analysis / Bias
Republican Daily does not appear to publish original news stories. Every article reviewed was republished from the far-right questionable source
[Trending Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trending-politics/). Trending Politics also features the writing of [Kyle Becker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/becker-news/), who has a poor track record with fact-checkers. The articles republished here maintain the same headline found on Trending Politics which often contains emotional wording that favors the right. For example, [Trump Wins CPAC Straw Poll in a Blowout, But the Real Laugher is Mike Penceâ€™s Support](https://republicandaily.net/2021/07/trump-wins-cpac-straw-poll-in-a-blowout-but-the-real-laugher-is-mike-pences-support/) and this denigrating the left [Maskless Democrat Lawmakers Take Shirtless Pic While Riding Camels in Qatar, Paid For By Special Interest Group](https://republicandaily.net/2021/07/maskless-democrat-lawmakers-take-shirtless-pic-while-riding-camels-in-qatar-paid-for-by-special-interest-group/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and some promote Covid-19 conspiracy theories such as this
[Chinese Scientist Filed COVID Vaccine Patent in February of 2020, Then Mysteriously Died](https://republicandaily.net/2021/06/chinese-scientist-filed-covid-vaccine-patent-in-february-of-2020-then-mysteriously-died/). While Republican Daily/Trending Politics quotes other sources in the article, they draw conclusions that are not a part of the quotes. In the above article, they lead one to believe the Chinese Scientist may have been murdered or that it proves that the Chinese Military was connected to the Wuhan Lab. In general, Republican Daily is a far-right source that sometimes promotes misleading news through the Questionable Trending Politics.
