History
[The Christian Truth Center](https://www.christiantruthcenter.com/christian-tc/) was established in June 2012 by Joshua Munguti. The website claims to convey “God’s knowledge and wisdom” by providing detailed Bible study teachings, prophecies, and testimonies. The website is not transparent about its location; however, it appears to be based in Kenya. [Read our profile on Kenyan media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kenya-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Christian Truth Center is distinctly faith-based, emphasizing prophecies and testimonies. Despite its religious focus, it includes speculative content about figures like Elon Musk and former
[President Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), blending conspiracy theories with religious themes. The combination of these elements results in content that is both conspiratorial and nonsensical.
For example, an article titled
[“Governments Pressure Elon Musk for a Super Weapon”](https://www.christiantruthcenter.com/governments-pressure-elon-musk-for-a-super-weapon/) claims that governments are pressuring Elon Musk to create a “super weapon.” It implies that Musk’s talents are divinely bestowed, elevating him to a divine status. The piece lacks empirical evidence and concludes with a religious call to repent, making it both conspiratorial and pseudoscientific.
Another article,
[“Donald Trump Receives More Influence and Becomes the President of USA”](https://www.christiantruthcenter.com/donald-trump-receives-more-influence-prophecy-fulfillment/) exhibits a strong right-leaning bias. It portrays Donald Trump as a divinely chosen leader, saying, “God did not only make him a president but gave him the two houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives.” The article also states, “God’s Will is for Donald Trump to push people to be micro-chipped.”
Author Joshua Munguti claims to have received a divine message that Trump would gain “more influence,” using this faith-based assertion as his form of evidence, which is not empirically verifiable. This faith-based “evidence” isn’t something we can fact-check—so take it with a celestial grain of salt.
