Analysis / Bias
[Philosophically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Institute), the Breakthrough Institute is associated with the ecological modernist movement, [ecomodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecomodernism). Ecomodernists are characterized by their belief that technology can be harnessed to better humanity and the environment. They frequently support genetic engineering and believe that nuclear energy is necessary to address [global warming](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).
In review, the Breakthrough Institute advocates for technology to address environmental issues such as climate change. Both the right and the left have criticized Breakthrough. On the right, they have been criticized for arguing about the importance of the federal government in producing technological innovations. On the left, they have been criticized for claiming that carbon pricing is not the solution to climate change, for being pro-nuclear, and for touting natural gas as a way to decrease coal usage. There is little use of loaded language, and all information is properly sourced.
