Analysis / Bias
In review, MindBodyGreen is a typical Mixed factual
[Pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) website. They publish plenty of credible articles that do not make fantastic claims, but within these, there are those that claim [herbs prevent cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) and cure disease. For example, in this article, the headline reads that Avacodos may cure Leukemia: [Avocados Could Hold The Key To Curing Leukemia.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-20372/avocados-could-hold-the-key-to-curing-leukemia.html) A review of the article shows this to be misleading. Avocados are a great food source and loaded with plenty of nutrients, but this misleading headline does not match the article. MindBodyGreen also does not support the [consensus of science](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-27390/new-investigation-reveals-something-fascinating-about-gmo-crops.html) when it comes to [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) as most articles paint them in a negative light. Interestingly, they do support the [consensus of science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) with [Climate Change](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/talking-about-climate-change-with-family). We call this selective science that may be financially or politically biased. Other articles promote incredible benefits from herbs, diets, and exercise routines that simply are not validated through peer-reviewed science.
