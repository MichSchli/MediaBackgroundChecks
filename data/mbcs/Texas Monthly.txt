Analysis / Bias
In review, Texas Monthly publishes very well-written long reading articles as well as political news, events, and lifestyle for the Austin Metro area. Articles and headlines utilize moderately loaded emotional wording that favors the left, such as this
[Critical Race Fury: The School Board Wars Are Getting Nasty in Texas](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/critical-race-fury-the-school-board-wars-are-getting-nasty-in-texas/). This long-form piece uses proper sourcing to credible outlets such as Edweek and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). The majority of stories cover food, fashion, restaurants, and entertainment in Austin.
Texas Monthly also reports on politics, often presenting a Left-leaning perspective like
[Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis Are Competing to Be Trump. Who’s Winning?](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/greg-abbott-ron-desantis-primary/) The content of this article is critical and negative of those who support Trump with a quote that reads, “In the Trump era, pissing off the other side matters more than achieving policy objectives. Accordingly, both Abbott and DeSantis have dug their heels in deep on the culture war issues of the day: “stopping the steal,” abortion, critical race theory, and making life harder for transgender kids.”
In general, the news is well-sourced, factual, and holds a moderate left-leaning editorial bias.
