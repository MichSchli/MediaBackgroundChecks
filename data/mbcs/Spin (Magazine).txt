History
Founded in 1985, Spin Magazine was a print magazine that reported on music news. It was considered an alternative to
[Rolling Stone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rolling-stone/) due to its coverage of less mainstream artists. In 2012, Spin ceased print publication and had since become an online-only webzine.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Spin primarily reports on music news and provides videos to live performances and interviews. They are also well known for their lists, such as
[The 50 Best Alt-Rock Love Songs](https://www.spin.com/featured/the-50-best-alt-rock-love-songs/). Spin reports music and industry news with low bias, such as this [Lana Del Rey to Release New Album Rock Candy Sweet in June](https://www.spin.com/2021/03/lana-del-rey-rock-candy-sweet-album-june/). When reporting on political news, it is usually related to the music industry, such as this [Iced Earthâ€™s Jon Schaffer to Be Held Without Bail Until Trial](https://www.spin.com/2021/03/iced-earths-jon-schaffer-to-be-held-without-bail-until-trial/) (Schaffer entered the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 riots).
Editorially, Spin rarely reports on politics and generally sticks to music news. However, there is a section called Death and Taxes on their domain, which used to be housed at deathandtaxes.com. This section covers culture and politics with a left-leaning bias such as this
[Mike Pence Looks Upset After Prince Charles Refuses to Shake His Hand](https://www.spin.com/2020/01/mike-pence-prince-charles-snub/). The news is generally reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
