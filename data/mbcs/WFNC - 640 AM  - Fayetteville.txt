Analysis / Bias
WFNC – 640 AM – Fayetteville does not publish local news but instead relies on the questionable
[Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/) and Daily Wire for national news reporting.
The radio station and website broadcasts a daily lineup of news radio hosts who generally hold conservative perspectives. They also feature nationally syndicated Cumulus hosts like
[Dan Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dan-bongino-bias-rating/) and [Sean Hannity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sean-hannity-bias-rating/), who have poor fact-check records.
Editorially, the majority of radio hosts hold conservative viewpoints, and they do republish opinionated political content from other sources, such as the questionable
[Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), which is a source known to advance conspiracy theories and misinformation. In general, radio shows and syndicated news exhibit a conservative bias and sometimes promote misleading or false claims.
