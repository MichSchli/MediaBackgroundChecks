Analysis / Bias
In review, the Norfolk Daily News covers local news through local journalists. National news is syndicated via the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). There is minimal use of loaded language in headlines and all information is sourced properly.
Editorially, the Norfolk Daily News does not have an opinion section, at least on the website that we are reviewing. The print paper may have one. A search of ownership donations indicates that the Huse family primarily donates money to
