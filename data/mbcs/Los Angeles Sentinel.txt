In examining specific content, such as the sponsored article “
[Building a More Inclusive Economy: Q&A with JPMorgan Chase’s Thelma Ferguson,”](https://lasentinel.net/building-a-more-inclusive-economy-qa-with-jpmorgan-chases-thelma-ferguson.html) it is important to note that sponsored articles are created in collaboration with or funded by external organizations, which can influence the tone and perspective presented. This article discusses JPMorgan Chase’s efforts towards diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly their $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment. It includes statements from Thelma Ferguson, a company representative, on their initiatives and goals. Factually, the article accurately represents JPMorgan Chase’s stated commitments and initiatives, corroborated by information on their website regarding their [racial equity](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/racialequity?tab=our-commitments) efforts.
Conversely, the editorial piece
[“Donald Trump’s Win in Iowa Should Be Wake-up Call for Black Voters](https://lasentinel.net/donald-trumps-win-in-iowa-should-be-wake-up-call-for-black-voters.html)” urges Black voter engagement and emphasizes the importance of voter turnout in shaping American democracy. While the article references factual events, such as Former President Trump’s involvement in the Capitol riot, it lacks specific evidence or citations to support its broader claims. For example, the article criticizes Trump for economic challenges during the pandemic. A quote from the article reads, “Let’s not forget who was asleep at the switch when the pandemic first came onto the shores of the United States. Yes, the one and only Donald Trump.” However, it overlooks broader economic factors like global conditions, Federal Reserve policies, etc. This absence of citations undermines its argument. Similarly, while it suggests Trump’s potential return to the White House, it fails to provide supporting evidence or polling data, making its broader arguments less substantiated.
Considering the nature of the content—from sponsored articles to editorials—and the publication’s endorsement of Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden in 2024, the Los Angeles Sentinel exhibits a left-center bias, mainly through its focus on social justice topics and political endorsements.
