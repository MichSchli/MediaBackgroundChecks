Analysis / Bias
In review, They consistently utilize loaded headlines and do not always source their information to other credible sources. For example, they quote a known purveyor of fake news,
[Mike Cernovich](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/danger-and-play/) for articles such as this: [http://www.dcstatesman.com/report-susan-rice-ordered-unmasking-trump-officials/. ](http://www.dcstatesman.com/report-susan-rice-ordered-unmasking-trump-officials/) In other articles they promote President Trump such as this [President Trump Touts His 22-0 Record](https://dcstatesman.com/president-trump-touts-his-22-0-record/). In general, it appears this source has not published in 6 months and might be pronounced dead, but we will keep it active for another year incase they come back.
