Analysis / Bias
In review, WAMU.org publishes news for the Washington DC area. Articles and headlines utilize minimally loaded emotional language, such as this
[Unable To Leave The House, Some D.C. Seniors Had The Election Come To Them](https://wamu.org/story/20/11/02/leave-house-pandemic-dc-senior-citizens-ballot-box-election-vote/). WAMU also republished news from the DCist and other [NPR stations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/). The website frequently covers politics with story selection that slightly favors the left [Democrats Are Ecstatic About The Biden-Harris Win; Republicans’ Reaction Is Mixed](https://wamu.org/story/20/11/07/democrats-are-ecstatic-about-the-biden-harris-win-republicans-not-so-much/). All information is sourced adequately from interviews and local and credible media outlets.
Editorially, WAMU does not have a dedicated opinion section; however, they label stories as opinions. Their opinion content is balanced mainly; however, more opinion pieces align with the left, such as this
[Opinion: Remembering The LGBT ‘Aunts’ And ‘Uncles’ Who Helped Raise Me](https://wamu.org/story/20/06/20/opinion-remembering-the-lgbt-aunts-and-uncles-who-helped-raise-me/). The news is generally reported factually and with a slight liberal bias through opinion pieces.
