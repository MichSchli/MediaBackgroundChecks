Analysis / Bias
Tsarizm is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate news source. All of the websites use a similar design template.
The website publishes news related to Russia and Eastern Europe that routinely favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this:
[The Left Is Now Telling Us (Ukrainian) Nazis Aren’t So Bad After All](https://tsarizm.com/analysis/2023/10/10/the-left-is-now-telling-us-ukrainian-nazis-arent-so-bad-after-all/). This article is republished from the factually mixed [Mises Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right, particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [The Only Thing That Will End War In Ukraine, Bring World Peace, Is Donald Trump Back In The White House](https://tsarizm.com/opinion/2022/08/12/the-only-thing-that-will-end-war-in-ukraine-bring-world-peace-is-donald-trump-back-in-the-white-house/). At the same time, denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [US Ambassador To Albania Goes Full Fascist In Support Of Soros-Enabled Socialist Government, Demonizes Populist Figure, Interferes In Elections](https://tsarizm.com/news/balkans/2022/04/24/us-ambassador-to-albania-goes-full-fascist-in-support-of-soros-enabled-socialist-government-demonizes-populist-figure-interferes-in-elections/).
Tsarizm also promotes
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://creativedestructionmedia.com/news/2022/01/02/dr-robert-malone-suggests-covid-vaccine-mandates-crimes-against-humanity-nuremberg-trials-needed-after-insurance-company-says-deaths-up-40/). In general, this is an imposter website that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
