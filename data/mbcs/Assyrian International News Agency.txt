[The Assyrian International News Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_International_News_Agency) (AINA) is an English-language news website focused on news and analysis on Assyrian and Assyrian-related issues. Peter BetBasoo and Firas Jatou are the site’s founders. Peter BetBasoo is the director of the Assyrian International News Agency. According to their [about page](http://www.aina.org/aboutaina.html), they originally started as a consulting agency about Middle East affairs and provided translation services for Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, and Assyrian languages. Generally, AINA provides news about the “persecution of Christians “in the Middle East.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the headlines and articles contain loaded words such as
[“The Genocide of Assyrians That Started in Iraq Continues in Syria](http://www.aina.org/releases/20150227041934.htm).” In the body of the same article, general statements such as “There is no moral ambiguity in what is occurring — ISIS is evil, and the source of this evil is Islam.” “The civilized world must find the courage to accept the force of its moral superiority and act on it. If it does not, the world will fall into shadow.”
Further, they poorly source their articles, and when they do, they source to themselves, for example,
[“Australia’s Assyrians in Focus.”](http://www.aina.org/releases/20160401023453.htm) The Assyrian International News Agency also syndicates articles from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/); however, the chosen stories reflect a pro-Christian bias.
The Southern Poverty Law Center has also cited the Assyrian International News Agency as anti-Islam based on an article
[published in 2008](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2011/anti-muslim-inner-circle) that generalizes all Muslims as violent. AINA has a strong right-wing bias that favors [conservatives and former President Trump](http://www.aina.org/news/20161110130204.htm).
