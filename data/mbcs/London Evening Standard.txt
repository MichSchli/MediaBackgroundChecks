Analysis / Bias
After the purchase of the paper in 2009, the paper began endorsing conservative candidates in London and throughout the UK. News stories also began favoring more conservative positions, as reflected by story choices. The London Evening Standard typically sources properly and can be considered factual.
In 2021, articles and headlines maintain a low biased tone, such as this
[Second vaccine doses will be administered on time, says minister](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/vaccine-second-dose-vaccine-guaranteed-oliver-dowden-b926681.html). However, when reporting on politics there tends to be moderate use of loaded wording such as this [PMQs: Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer in explosive row over defence spending](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/pmqs-boris-johnson-keir-starmer-row-defence-spending-b925994.html).
Editorially, the Evening Standard has traditionally supported conservative candidates. This continues as they are endorsing conservative London Mayor candidate Shaun Bailey
[Evening Standard comment: We back Shaun Bailey as the Tory mayoral candidate; Snapping the seven-ups](https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-we-back-shaun-bailey-as-the-tory-mayoral-candidate-snapping-the-sevenups-a3938726.html). Although they provide coverage of both sides, more stories favor a conservative perspective. In general, the news is reported mostly factually and with a moderate right-leaning editorial bias.
