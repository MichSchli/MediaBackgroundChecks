Analysis / Bias
In this section, we analyze the bias in Daily NK’s reporting, highlighting two articles of dozens reviewed. We examine the language, framing, and cited sources to assess the level of objectivity and potential bias.
The first article,
[“N. Korean Teacher Replaced after Encouraging Competition among Students,”](https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korean-teacher-replaced-after-encouraging-competition-among-students/) is framed in a way that reads more like a narrative than a news report. The framing focuses on replacing a teacher for encouraging competition, implicitly critiquing North Korea’s education system that aligns with Daily NK’s critical stance toward the North Korean regime. The article lacks cited references and relies on anonymous sources within North Korea, as per Daily NK’s reporting methodology. While using anonymous sources is explained as a security measure, it raises concerns about the article’s accuracy, objectivity, and credibility of the information presented.
The second article,
[“N. Korea’s Defense Ministry Criticizes Military Units That Failed to Collect Enough Salt,”](https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korea-defense-ministry-criticizes-military-units-failed-collect-enough-salt/) discusses the North Korean Ministry of Defense’s criticism of military units for failing to meet salt collection quotas. The article cites an anonymous source in Pyongyang and mentions that some logistics officers were found to have sold some of the salt they collected for personal gain. At the bottom of the article, Daily NK includes the same note about their reporting methodology, stating that they work with a network of anonymous sources due to security concerns.
In general, Daily NK has a critical stance toward North Korea and receives U.S. government-funded support. Its use of anonymous sources raises questions about article verifiability. Caution is advised when interpreting its reports. We rate their information as ‘factually mixed’ due to uncertainty about its accuracy.
