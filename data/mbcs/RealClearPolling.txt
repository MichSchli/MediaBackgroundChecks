Analysis / Bias
RealClearPolling was launched in December 2023 and features polling data typically found on
[Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/) in an updated graphical format. The new website covers the same polls as Real Clear Politics and focuses on presidential performance polls, state and national elections, and the direction of the country. The primary difference between the two websites is that RealClearPolling does not publish news and commentary like RCP. Further, RCP clearly favors the right in its story selection and editorial positions, whereas RealClearPolling does not offer opinions and just publishes polls and their analysis.
In general, RealClearPolling does not exhibit political bias and focuses on publishing polling data. While the validity of polls can vary, this website offers objective averages and is fact-based.
