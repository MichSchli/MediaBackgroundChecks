Analysis / Bias
In review, Scripps News is a video news network that produces short-form video news pieces that provide breaking news and updates across U.S. and world news, policy and politics, science and health, entertainment, technology, business, and sports. In general, Scripps News creates video news stories from their own journalists and then attaches the written transcript, which helps those who would prefer to read (such as me).
Article/video headlines use minimally loaded language such as this “
[New Bill Would Prevent Trump From Unilaterally Withdrawing From NATO.”](https://www.newsy.com/stories/senate-bill-introduced-to-stop-a-nato-withdrawal-from-trump/) The accompanying transcripts provide hyperlinked sourcing to credible media outlets such as govinfo.gov, law.cornell.edu, dod.defense.gov, the [El Paso Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/el-paso-times/), and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/).
When it comes to science reporting, they support the
[consensus of science](https://www.newsy.com/search/?keyword=GMO) in all fields. Editorially, there is a slight left-leaning bias in story selection that favors the left.
