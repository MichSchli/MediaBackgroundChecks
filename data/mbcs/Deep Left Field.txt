Analysis / Bias
In review, Deep Left Field is a news and opinion website that promotes a left-leaning perspective. All articles on this website are pro-left and anti-right. This is not surprising as their tagline is “The Place for Progressive Political Debate.” Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional wording that favors the left, such as this:
[Trump Panics As McConnell Loses Control Of The Senate Impeachment Trial](http://deepleftfield.info/trump-panics-as-mcconnell-loses-control-of-the-senate-impeachment-trial/). This story is not properly sourced to hyperlinked information, rather, words in the story are hyperlinked to make you think it is a link to a source for the information, but in fact, it is actually deceptive advertising. In general, all stories on this site favor the left and denigrate the right while not sourcing information properly.
