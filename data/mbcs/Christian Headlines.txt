Analysis / Bias
In review, Christian Headlines publishes Christian-themed news and information from both original creators as well as republication from other Salem Media properties. Headlines and wording often utilize minimally loaded language such as this:
[Appeals Court Overturns Ban on Prayer before Florida High School Football Games](https://www.christianheadlines.com/contributors/will-maule/appeals-court-overturns-ban-on-prayer-before-florida-high-school-football-games.html). This story is sourced to the [Christian Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-post/), which we rate Mixed for factual reporting due to a failed fact check. They also utilize credible sources such as [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, Christian Headlines reports favorably on former President Donald Trump, such as this:
[Franklin Graham Asks Americans to Pray for Trump as Impeachment Hearings Begin](https://www.christianheadlines.com/blog/franklin-graham-asks-americans-to-pray-for-trump-as-impeachment-hearings-begin.html). When it comes to social issues, they take conservative Christian positions such as [anti-abortion stances,](https://www.christianheadlines.com/columnists/al-mohler/abortion-as-american-as-apple-pie-culture-of-death.html) [human-influenced global warming skepticism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and [negative reporting on LGBTQ](https://www.christianheadlines.com/contributors/michael-foust/florida-high-school-bans-pro-life-club-allows-lgbtq-group-it-s-blatantly-illegal.html).
The website has promoted misinformation related to abortion. For example, they have claimed that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer:
[Study Shows Link between Abortion and Breast Cancer in China](https://www.christianheadlines.com/blog/study-shows-link-between-abortion-and-breast-cancer-in-china.html). This report comes from the website [Life News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-news/), which has a poor track record with fact-checkers and routinely publishes anti-abortion propaganda. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), the consensus of studies indicates that “induced abortion is not linked to an increase in breast cancer risk.”
