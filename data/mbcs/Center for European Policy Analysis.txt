Funded by / Ownership
[CEPA](https://cepa.org/about-cepa/our-supporters/) receives funding from various donors, including major technology companies such as Google and Amazon Web Services and key players in the defense industry like Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. While they list supporters, CEPA doesn’t disclose specific financial amounts. This lack of transparency among think tanks raises concerns about potential biases in their research and publications. [Larry Hirsch](https://cepa.org/author/larry-hirsch/) serves as Chairman of CEPA.
Analysis / Bias
CEPA analyzes Central and Eastern Europe’s foreign policy, focusing on the interaction with the EU and the US. For example, the article “Italy’s
[Meloni: Aligning With the US in Turbulent Times.”](https://cepa.org/article/italys-meloni-aligning-with-the-us-in-turbulent-times/) offers insights into [Italy’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/italy-media-profile/) geopolitical challenges and opportunities. The article contains a quote highlighting Meloni’s stance on a recent geopolitical event: “However, since the all-out invasion began, she has unambiguously condemned [Putin](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vladimir-putin-russia-facts-and-bias/) and his aggression, supporting the West’s efforts to arm [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/).” The article appears favorable towards a political figure with known [far-right leanings](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-rome-italy-gay-rights-51255b9f6e8627b3c5daddc83df83c3b).
CEPA cites various sources, including
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [The Economist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/euronews/), [Euronews,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/euronews/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and other sources we have not reviewed yet, such as Oryxspioenkop, naval technology, diplomatic courier, and ifw-kie.
Another article, “
[Get Ready, Europe: Trump(ism) ‘s Coming](https://cepa.org/article/get-ready-europe-trumpisms-coming/),” discusses Europe’s stance on the potential resurgence of Trump’s influence. The article references both Trump’s and Obama’s administrations, with phrases such as “True, the first Trump presidency was not the geopolitical disaster that his critics foretold” and “Given the woeful past (Obama’s reset, anyone?)…” This phrase refers to the Obama administration’s initial attempts to [reset its relationship with Russia.](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/us-russia-relations-reset-fact-sheet) The phrasing, especially “anyone?” at the end, suggests a skeptical or dismissive tone of the Previous Obama Administration. In general, CEPA is factual and aligns with right-of-center defense positions.
