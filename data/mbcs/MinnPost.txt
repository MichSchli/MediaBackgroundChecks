Analysis / Bias
In review, MinnPost publishes a wide variety of news concerning Minnesota, ranging from politics to the environment. There is little use of loaded language such as this
[Thousands gather for peaceful protests around Twin Cities](https://www.minnpost.com/glean/2020/06/thousands-gather-for-peaceful-protests-around-the-twin-cities/). This story is properly sourced to the [Pioneer Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/st-paul-pioneer-press/) and [Star Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/minneapolis-star-tribune/). There is a left-leaning political bias as most stories favor the left, in particular when it comes to the [environment](https://www.minnpost.com/earth-journal/2018/05/us-and-uk-rushing-understand-risks-rapidly-shrinking-antarctic-glacier).
In general, they report news factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
