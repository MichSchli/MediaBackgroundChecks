History
[Founded in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Socialist_Web_Site), The World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) is a widely accessed international socialist news site, the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). The site is closely associated with the Trotskyist Socialist Equality Party. According to their [about page](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/about.html), “The standpoint of this website is one of revolutionary opposition to the capitalist market system. Its aim is the establishment of world socialism.” The World Socialist Web Site publishes articles and analyses of news and events worldwide updated daily.

Analysis / Bias
In review, WSWS reports news from a Trotskyist Socialist perspective, highlighting income inequality, promotion of free speech, and equal civil rights for all. Headlines and articles sometimes contain moderately loaded wording such as this:
[The epidemic of nurse suicides and the US healthcare crisis](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/09/07/pers-s07.html). This article cites stats from the Pro-Science [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/). The website also reports on global police abuses such as this: [Another police-state raid in Australia to protect spy agencies](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/09/07/raid-s07.html).
When reporting on politics, WSWS does not have a favorable view of the American Right or
[President Trump](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/09/05/wall-s05.html); furthermore, they also reject the Democratic party as being a party of the right: [The Democratic debate: A right-wing party unmasked](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/08/01/deba-a01.html). Finally, WSWS frequently reports favorably on [Wikileaks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikileaks/) and [Julian Assange](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/09/06/wiki-s06.html), which we have rated as Mixed for factual reporting due to the “promotion of the Seth Rich-DNC Conspiracy Theory, as well as connections to the Russian Government and frequent use of anonymous sources.”
The World Socialist Web Site also reports on
[science](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/site_area/science/) and generally holds pro-Science consensus viewpoints while reporting more negatively on [religion](https://www.wsws.org/en/topics/philosophyCategory/eco-reli/).
The American right-wing press has referenced the World Socialist Web Site as an example of left-wing extremism (The Las Vegas Review-Journal, 29 March 2006).
