Analysis / Bias
In review, Breaking Christian News primarily serves as a conservative Christian news aggregator. They typically republish summaries and occasionally full articles from other right-leaning sources such as
[Christian Headlines](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-headlines/), [LifeSiteNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/), and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), each of which has poor track records with fact-checkers. Articles and headlines feature moderately loaded emotional language such as this: [MAN DEFENDING HOME FROM ANGRY BLM PROTESTERS IS AN ATTORNEY WHO HAS FOUGHT POLICE BRUTALITY](https://www.breakingchristiannews.com/articles/display_art.html?ID=30650).
Editorially all stories favor the Christian Right, with many opposed to abortion
