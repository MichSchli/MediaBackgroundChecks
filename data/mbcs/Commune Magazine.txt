Analysis / Bias
In review, Commune has a leftist stance and advocates socialism, featuring lengthy essays and articles about poverty, immigration, war, and social problems. Headlines of articles contain strongly loaded wording such as this:
[“Capitalism must resign”](https://communemag.com/donde-estas-revolucion/) and [“Communism is for moms, or it’s nothing.”](https://communemag.com/the-year-of-the-wombat/) This article is written by editor Madeline Lane-McKinley, and Commune also publishes articles by socialist writers such as [Haider Riaz Khan](https://communemag.com/contributor/haider-riaz-khan/), who calls himself “a socialist with anarchist sympathies.”
Editorially, they strongly align with the socialist/communist left. In general, information is fact-based; however, hyperlinked sourcing is not available.
