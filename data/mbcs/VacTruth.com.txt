History
[Founded in 2009](http://whois.domaintools.com/vactruth.com), VacTruth.com is an anti-vaxx website that promotes the debunked dangers of vaccines. Like most non-credible sources, they do not list ownership, nor disclose a mission on their [about page](https://vactruth.com/about/). They do list authors, some with [biographies](https://vactruth.com/author/michelle-goldstein/), but [none](https://vactruth.com/author/christina-england/) with expertise relating to medicine and vaccinations.
Funded by / Ownership
VacTruth.com does not disclose ownership and is funded through donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, VacTruth.com does not even attempt to be a
[credible science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) website, with every article either portraying vaccines negatively or outright being false and opposed to the consensus of science. For example, the article [New Research Proves Brains of Children with Autism are Loaded with Aluminum](https://vactruth.com/2017/12/05/aluminum-and-autism/) has been [thoroughly debunked](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/scientists-fake-autism-study-data) by scientists. This article, [Baby Foreskin Is Being Used To Make Vaccines,](https://vactruth.com/2017/09/28/foreskin-used-in-vaccines/) is another that is [completely false](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/human-foreskin-vaccines-zombie-myth/).
In general, very little information on this website is verified as true.
