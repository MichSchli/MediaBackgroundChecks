Analysis / Bias
According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal had a 2014 impact factor of 0.758. The journal was delisted in the 2015 edition because of excessive self-citations. Although this is a peer-reviewed journal, it is focused on alternative medicine, which often promotes pseudoscience.
While there is nothing wrong with studying homeopathy, there is very little evidence that it is safer or more effective than traditional medicine. Our advice is to be cautious when considering homeopathic remedies.
