Analysis / Bias
The Science History Institute does not really publish news. It simply is an institute that “collects and shares the stories of innovators and of discoveries that shape our lives. They preserve and interpret the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and the life sciences.” There is not much to say here. This is a pro-science source with the aim to preserve scientific history.
