Analysis / Bias
International Man, led by Doug Casey, frequently challenges mainstream narratives, as seen in articles like
[“Doug Casey on the Labor Shortage and Other Disturbing Distortions in the Economy,”](https://internationalman.com/articles/us-labor-shortage-and-the-implications-of-stimulus-checks/) where Casey expresses skepticism towards government statistics, claiming, “especially when we’re looking at monetary and economic numbers, it’s increasingly apparent that the US government’s statistics are only marginally more reliable than those of the Argentine government.” His criticisms often lack empirical evidence, reflecting a contrarian and libertarian viewpoint, which often questions the reliability and motives behind government-provided information. However, the lack of direct evidence or data to support these assertions means readers are encouraged to accept his perspective based on his authority as a commentator rather than verified facts.
In
[“Doug Casey on the World’s First Anarcho-Capitalist President,”](https://internationalman.com/articles/doug-casey-on-the-worlds-first-anarcho-capitalist-president/) Casey supports [Argentine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/argentina-government-and-media-profile/) far-right libertarian [Javier Milei ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/analyst-view-argentine-far-right-libertarian-milei-sweeps-victory-2023-11-20/)due to shared anarcho-capitalist beliefs. He says, “He’s as radical and sincere as my old friend Harry Browne,” appreciating Milei’s radical economic reforms and alignment with libertarian values. Additionally, Casey aligns with Milei’s rejection of mainstream narratives on climate change, referring to them as a “hoax,” and his criticism of the global response to COVID-19, demonstrating a shared skepticism towards widely accepted scientific and political positions.
For example, the article
[Why the COVID Delusion Continues](https://internationalman.com/articles/why-the-covid-delusion-continues/) states the following without evidence: “Those studies have been showing with fair consistency that the jab was indeed detrimental – both short-term and long-term. At this point, scores of studies have come to this conclusion, and even many prominent doctors who initially supported vaxxing are now stating emphatically, “We were lied to.” Without providing evidence to support this claim, the author is promoting a pseudoscientific conspiracy theory regarding the vaccine.
Casey’s stance on immigration is complex. While advocating for
[open borders](https://internationalman.com/articles/doug-caseys-two-days-with-the-real-and-wannabee-elite/) in principle, his views on European immigration, particularly regarding [Muslim immigrants](https://internationalman.com/articles/doug-casey-on-what-the-elites-at-davos-are-really-up-to/), suggest a selective approach. In [“Doug Casey’s Two Days with the Real and Wannabe Elite,”](https://internationalman.com/articles/doug-caseys-two-days-with-the-real-and-wannabee-elite/) he states, “The migrants coming to Europe aren’t being attracted by opportunity in the new land so much as the welfare benefits and the soft life.” This perspective implies cultural and religious biases, contradicting libertarian ideals of free movement. This selective stance, particularly his focus on the cultural and religious background of the immigrants, can be interpreted as inconsistent with the libertarian ideal of free movement irrespective of personal background.
The articles are often poorly sourced. For example, in “Doug Casey on What the Elites at Davos Are Really Up To,” the question
[“In previous years, we’ve seen the people at Davos promote various themes that later became policy. What is going on here?”](https://internationalman.com/articles/doug-casey-on-what-the-elites-at-davos-are-really-up-to/) is presented without external hyperlink/evidence instead primarily references other articles within the same website, as seen with the hyperlink to [“Guide to Surviving and Thriving During an Economic Collapse,”](https://internationalman.com/special-report/guide-to-surviving-and-thriving-during-an-economic-collapse/) leading to potential circular reasoning and a lack of diverse, independent sources.
