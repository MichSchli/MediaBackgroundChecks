Analysis / Bias
In 2021,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Serbia 93/180 in their Press [Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/serbia). The current President is Aleksandar Vučić (populist right).
In review, the Informer predominantly delivers tabloid-style lifestyle news and crime stories that are heavily image-focused with sensational headlines such as
[“Even half of the men can’t get it up, and they are to blame for everything.”](https://informer.rs/vesti/drustvo/687224/seksualna-disfunkcija-problem-urolog)
When covering national news, the headlines support the government, such as
[“SERBIA NEEDS VUCIC! Dacic at the pre-election rally: He is the best solution for the crisis times that follow!”](https://informer.rs/vesti/politika/687186/dacic-vucic-palma-kriza) According to [Balkan Insight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/balkan-insight/), pro-Serbian government media such as the [Informer](https://balkaninsight.com/2022/02/25/serbian-pro-regime-media-praise-russia-overrunning-ukraine/) “hailed the Russian invasion of Ukraine on their front pages,” with the headline titled ”Russia reached Kyiv in a day.” When it comes to sourcing, the Informer rarely uses hyperlinks but does offer quotations and [social media links](https://informer.rs/planeta/vesti/687242/ukrajina-rusija-rat-sad-oruzje). In general, they promote right-wing pro-government propaganda and lack credibility due to poor sourcing and overly sensationalized stories.
