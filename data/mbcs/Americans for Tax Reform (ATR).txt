Analysis / Bias
According to
[Desmog](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/desmog/), Grover Nordquist is a [prominent climate change denier and lobbyist](https://www.desmog.com/american-conservative-union/). Further, [Grover Norquist,](https://www.atr.org/about-grover) and Joe Bast of the [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/), works with the [American Conservative Union (ACU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-conservative-union-acu-bias/)) to promote [climate change skepticism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), such as [“The Grover Norquist Show: The Real Science and Politics Behind Global Warming.”](https://www.atr.org/grover-norquist-show-real-science-and-politics-behind-global-warming)
In review, Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) utilizes credible sources such as
[CNBC,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) treasury.gov and mostly factual sources such as [taxfoundation.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tax-foundation/) and the [Wall Street Journal.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) They often publish articles critical of Biden administration, such as [Biden Budget Calls for 30 Tax Increases](https://www.atr.org/biden-budget-calls-30-tax-increases) and [5 Reasons Why Joe Biden’s Claim About No New Taxes Under $400,000 Is False](https://www.atr.org/5-reasons-why-joe-biden-s-claim-about-no-new-taxes-under-400000-false).
Editorially, Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) promotes an anti-tax, anti-government conservative agenda. For example, Grover Norquist says,
[“My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.”](https://books.google.com/books?id=xv3HQuxPfBIC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22My+goal+is+to+cut+government+in+half+in+twenty-five+years,+to+get+it+down+to+the+size+where+we+can+drown+it+in+the+bathtub.%22+-+Grover+Norquist,+Americans+for+Tax+Reform&source=bl&ots=a3RKJogGrV&sig=ACfU3U3UBCo38mSiz83UkUvdijrZPTwG2A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRzsa1ne_xAhWUGs0KHRk8CCgQ6AEwBHoECA4QAw#v=onepage&q=%22My%20goal%20is%20to%20cut%20government%20in%20half%20in%20twenty-five%20years%2C%20to%20get%20it%20down%20to%20the%20size%20where%20we%20can%20drown%20it%20in%20the%20bathtub.%22%20-%20Grover%20Norquist%2C%20Americans%20for%20Tax%20Reform&f=false) Finally, they strongly support former President Trump, such as [“Thanks to Trump, Median Household Income at Highest Level Ever.”](https://www.atr.org/thanks-trump-median-household-income-highest-level-ever) In general, the ATR is right-biased and sometimes promotes conservative propaganda and misinformation, especially on topics involving science.
