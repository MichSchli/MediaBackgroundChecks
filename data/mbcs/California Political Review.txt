Analysis / Bias
In review, the California Political Review covers California politics with a right-leaning bias in wording and story selection, such as this
[Silicon Valley Is Moving to Texas](http://www.capoliticalreview.com/capoliticalnewsandviews/silicon-valley-is-moving-to-texas/) and this [Sanctuary Nation: Santa Clara County’s Toleration of Illegal-Immigrant Crime](http://www.capoliticalreview.com/top-stories/sanctuary-nation-santa-clara-countys-toleration-of-illegal-immigrant-crime/). This story is sourced from credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and Questionable sources such as the [Center for Immigration Studies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-immigration-studies-cis/), which has been classified as a hate group. The news is generally reported mostly factually and with a right-leaning bias.
