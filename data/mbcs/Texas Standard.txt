Analysis / Bias
All information is fact-based, and they make sure to have guests and/or report from both sides of an issue to give proper perspective. There is zero use of loaded language, and everything is sourced to highly credible sources such as
[Politifact Texas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/). For example, the headline of this article clearly states the content of the article [‘It Just Seems Neverending’: A Nurse In Pearsall Talks About Keeping Rural COVID Care Going Amid Burnout](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/it-just-seems-neverending-a-nurse-in-pearsall-talks-about-keeping-rural-covid-care-going-amid-burnout/). It is also properly sourced to credible media outlets such as other NPR stations.
Editorially, they may align left by Texas standards as they cover diverse points of view, but on the whole, they are least biased for the same reason.
