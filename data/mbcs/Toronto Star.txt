In review, the Toronto Star reports local news through journalists and national/international news via such sources as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). There is minimal use of loaded language in reporting local news: [Province submits fresh evidence in ongoing court fight over Toronto council cut](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2018/11/02/province-submits-fresh-evidence-in-ongoing-court-fight-over-toronto-council-cut.html).
On the other hand, editorials utilize moderately loaded headlines that favor the left, such as this:

In general, story selection tends to favor the left.
