Funded by / Ownership
The American Firearms Institute does not list who owns the website; however, they describe funding “American Firearms is reader-supported. We may earn a small part of the sale from links to any products or services on this site. You do not pay anything extra, and your purchase helps support our work.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, the American Firearms Institute does not report the news. The website’s purpose is to be a resource for information regarding guns and statistics. There is occasional use of loaded words when describing how people are to blame for gun deaths and not guns, such as “
[Its the criminal stupid](http://www.americanfirearms.org/reports-and-opinions/).” Most information is reasonably sourced to FBI statistics and the ATF.
