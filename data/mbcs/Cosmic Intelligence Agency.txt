Analysis / Bias
[Astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/) is a [pseudoscience](http://www2.palomar.edu/users/jgilardi/astrology%20debunk.htm) that is not rooted in any form of evidence and has been debunked for years. Therefore, we rate Cosmic Intelligence Agency a quack-level pseudoscience website.
