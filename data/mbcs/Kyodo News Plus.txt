Analysis / Bias
The article titled; “
[Japan parliament to convene extraordinary session on Oct. 20](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/09/902a109a3223-japan-parliament-to-convene-extraordinary-session-on-oct-20.html)” provides a factual account of the upcoming extraordinary session of Japan’s parliament. While the article does not contain hyperlinks for direct references, it uses quotes to attribute statements to key political figures, ensuring the credibility of the information presented. Kyodo News Agency is the source of this article.
The article “
[Japan PM Kishida Sacks Son as Executive Secretary Amid Criticism](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2023/05/737ffea2ae80-urgent-kishidas-son-to-step-down-as-executive-secretary-to-pm-govt.html)” delves into the controversy surrounding Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s decision regarding his son. The article uses words like “lambasted,” which can carry a strong connotation, but it balances this by presenting both the government’s perspective and the criticism from opposition parties. Like the first article, it uses quotes to attribute statements but lacks hyperlinks for direct references.
In summary, both articles from Kyodo News Plus present their content focusing on factual reporting using quotes for attribution. The absence of hyperlinks might be a style choice for the platform, but the use of direct quotes ensures the credibility of the information. The word choices in the articles are mostly neutral, with occasional strong connotations balanced out by presenting multiple perspectives.
