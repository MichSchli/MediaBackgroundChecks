History
Established in 1945,
[Berliner Zeitung](http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/index.php?id=155) is a daily newspaper from Germany. [In 1990](https://books.google.com/books?id=vxZoAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA23-PP4&lpg=RA23-PP4&dq=Robert+Maxwell+acquired+Berliner+Zeitung&source=bl&ots=HonEa_Pqh_&sig=ACfU3U2OGbNcu0X6a6OenTZjT8ltVWWaKw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi636m47-3pAhWGVN8KHZ6-DvAQ6AEwBHoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Maxwell%20acquired%20Berliner%20Zeitung&f=false), the paper was acquired by [Gruner + Jahr](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-17-fi-639-story.html) (owned by Bertelsmann) and the British publisher Robert Maxwell. In June 2002, Holtzbrinck took over Berliner Zeitung, and due to antitrust laws, there were complications; therefore, in [2005, Holtzbrinck](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/14/pressandpublishing.business) resold it to the Mecom Group, owned by [British media tycoon David Montgomery](https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-paper-braces-for-foreign-takeover/a-1740358). In 2009, Mecom [sold](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL772346520090107) Berliner Zeitung to publisher M. DuMont Schauberg (MDS). Finally, in 2019, Silke and Holger Friedrich [acquired](http://m.dumont.de/en/medienbereich/artikel/der-berliner-verlag-kommt-wieder-in-berliner-hand.html) Berliner Zeitung from MDS (M. DuMont Schauberg).

The new owner Holger Friedrich is described as a
[“Technology fetishist”](https://www.zeit.de/kultur/2019-11/holger-silke-friedrich-berliner-zeitung-verleger-stasi-vergangenheit/seite-2) who is an IT strategist and runs [Core](https://core.se/about/people/leadership), a consulting firm for the financial sector. According to [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), based on the published documents by Newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Holger Friedrich was a [Stasi ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/world/europe/berliner-zeitung-stasi.html)spy. [Holger Friedrich](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/18/german-newspaper-investigates-owner-stasi-past/) has said, “he was coerced into agreeing to work as an informant after being arrested following a failed attempt to escape to the West.” In addition, according to [Spiegel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/spiegel-online/), on November 8th, Berliner Zeitung reported about a biotech company [Centogene](https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/holger-friedrich-gibt-es-interessenkonflikte-bei-der-berliner-zeitung-a-1296645.html); however, they did not mention Friedrich himself as a shareholder of Centogene.
In review, Berliner Zeitung publishes articles with emotionally loaded language critical of the right such as
[“Only the left-wing parties are fully committed to democracy”](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik-gesellschaft/gastbeitrag-raed-saleh-nur-die-linke-mitte-steht-zum-grundgesetz-li.76050?lid=true) and [“Angela Merkel’s interpretation of the constitution is negligent.”](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik-gesellschaft/angela-merkels-interpretation-der-verfassung-ist-fahrlaessig-li.84520?lid=true) Regarding reporting about immigrants, mainly Muslim immigrants, they publish articles such as [“Does “Islam” belongs to Germany?”](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/kommentar-gehoert-der-islam-zu-deutschland-li.55134?lid=true). A quote from the article reads, “All Islamic-dominated states propagate hatred of Jews. This is incompatible with today’s German state policy.”
Regarding sourcing, they rarely hyperlink and mostly use quotes such as DPA (Hamburg-based German News Agency) and FAZ (Conservative German newspaper). When covering the US, the tone is negative towards President Trump
[“Why Donald Trump treated New York so badly.”](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik-gesellschaft/warum-donald-trump-new-york-so-schlecht-behandelt-li.80046?lid=true) They generally hold a left-leaning editorial bias and publish mostly factual news.
