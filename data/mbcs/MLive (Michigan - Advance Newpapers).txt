Analysis / Bias
The MLive website publishes multiple local and statewide newspapers that readers can filter. Articles and headlines often do not contain highly emotional wording as they are credible local newspapers such as this
[Ann Arbor Coffee Roasting Co. to take over former State Street Espresso Royale location](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2021/07/ann-arbor-coffee-roasting-co-to-take-over-former-state-street-espresso-royale-location.html). National and international news is reported through the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion content from a wide, but never extreme, and reasonably balanced perspective. The papers associated with MLive vary from Right-Center to Left-Center, so the viewpoint reflects that. In general, MLive is a reliable, low-biased, and factual source of information for Michigan News.
