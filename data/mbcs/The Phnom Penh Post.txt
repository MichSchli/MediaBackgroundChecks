Analysis / Bias
[Hun Sen](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-usa/trump-urges-cambodia-to-return-to-democratic-path-after-crackdown-idUSKBN1XW0GC) is the current Prime Minister of Cambodia (since 1985). He is also president of the [left-wing](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0008388/) [Cambodian People’s Party](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-politics/cambodia-pm-says-ruling-party-to-dominate-politics-for-up-to-100-years-idUSKBN23T0TO) (ruling political party of Cambodia since 1979.) [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) described the [paper](https://fr.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N1SE1Z0) before its sale to Ganapthy as an “English-language daily, which has been largely critical of the government.” A quote from the article reads, “The purchase of The Phnom Penh Post by a Malaysian whose public relations firm lists Cambodia’s long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen as a client is a “disaster” for media freedom ahead of a general election, an international rights group said on Monday.” After the sale, the [Editor-in-Chief](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44027032) and some of its staff were fired.
In review, The Phnom Penh Post publishes articles with emotionally loaded headlines mostly praising the current Prime Minister Hun Sen with “positive” coverage such as
[“Hun Sen celebrates women’s rights”](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/hun-sen-celebrates-womens-rights) and [“Hun Sen asks Cambodians to believe in government”](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national-politics/hun-sen-asks-cambodians-believe-government) or [“Hun Sen not afraid of travelling to epicentre of coronavirus outbreak”](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/hun-sen-not-afraid-travelling-epicentre-coronavirus-outbreak). International news comes from two primary sources, either [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) or the Asia News Network. When it comes to sourcing, they rely on quotes rather than hyperlinks.
Editorially, a review of opinion pieces reveals that more favor the left such as this
[It is time for those who have the most to pay the most](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/opinion/it-time-those-who-have-most-pay-most). Further, the paper does not criticize the left-wing ruling party. In general, national and international news is rooted in fact; however, there is a significant omission of negative coverage of the government resulting in the promotion of propaganda.
