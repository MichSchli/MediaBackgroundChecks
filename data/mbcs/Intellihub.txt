History
Founded in 2013, Intellihub is a far-right conspiracy site that promotes debunked and false claims. The website was founded by Shepard Ambellas, who states on the
[about page](https://www.intellihub.com/about/) “is one of the few independent (alternative) news personalities to have his work picked up by the [Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/) for his news teams provocative Bilderberg Group coverage in Chantilly, Virginia in June of 2012. The Drudge Report headline article “Alternative Media Group Plans Wall-to-Wall Bilderberg Coverage” was later spotlighted on the Alex Jones Radio Show by [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) himself when talking about “the power of Drudge“.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Intellihub publishes original reporting as well as republishes from discredited sources such as
[Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), and [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/). Original reporting often lacks transparency as they do not name authors and utilizes loaded emotional language that always favors the right such as this [Portland Police find themselves in ground war against BLM protesters](https://www.intellihub.com/portland-police-find-themselves-in-ground-war-against-blm-protesters/).
Intellihub frequently promotes conspiracy theories such as the
[Clintons murdering](https://www.intellihub.com/suicided-despite-no-gun-police-say-lawyer-connected-to-dnc-fraud-suit-shot-himself/) those who allegedly may expose them, as well as the debunked [Pizzagate](https://www.intellihub.com/why-is-pizzagate-so-farfetched-proven-pedophilia-disgustingly-widespread-among-those-in-power/) and [9-11 conspiracies](https://www.intellihub.com/911-scandal-forged-documents-used-court-ken-timmerman-zakeri-fabricator-monumental-proportions/). In general, this is a completely unreliable site for factual information that frequently promotes far-right conspiracy theories that are either unproven or false. See above and below.
