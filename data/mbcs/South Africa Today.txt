Analysis / Bias
In review, South Africa Today News uses loaded words in their headlines and
[articles](https://southafricatoday.net/south-africa-news/take-mandelas-london-statue-down/) that favor the BNP (far-right and fascist political party in the United Kingdom) politician [Jack Sen](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-32555535) who is known for anti-Semitic slurs. South Africa Today also [promotes](https://southafricatoday.net/south-africa-news/scientists-prove-front-nationals-argument/) the [Front National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_National_(South_Africa)) of South Africa, a far-right, white nationalist, secessionist party. South Africa Today republishes articles from credible sources such as [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/), but under the world news category, they also [republish](https://southafricatoday.net/world-news/russia/nato-russia-deny-reports-about-plans-to-freeze-nato-russia-council/) factually questionable sources like [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/). They also publish articles [without any sourcing](https://southafricatoday.net/south-africa-news/kwazulu-natal/4-hijackers-a-stolen-vehicle-and-a-victim/) at all. Further, many articles on the website seem to be very pro-Russian with a fascination for [Vladimir Putin](https://southafricatoday.net/world-news/russia/happy-birthday-mr-president-how-well-do-you-know-vladimir-putin/).
