Analysis / Bias
In review, Niskanen Center publishes
[articles](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/rightly-governing-solar-geoengineering-research/) that are very well sourced to scientific journals. However, they also occasionally use loaded words in their headlines: “ [FIRE, FURY, AND FOOLISH STATEMENTS ON NORTH KOREA](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/fire-fury-foolish-statements-north-korea/)” and use sources from left and right, respectively. They sometimes use factually mixed sources such as [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) to make their points. Niskanen Center also publishes Op-Ed articles with thoroughly researched analysis: “ [WHAT DRIVES OPPOSITION TO IMMIGRATION? IN-GROUP FAVORITISM, OUT-GROUP HOSTILITY, AND DONALD TRUMP](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/drives-opposition-immigration-group-favoritism-group-hostility-donald-trump/),” which utilizes sources such as [Berkeley.edu](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/immigration-wages-compositional-amenities.pdf) and [Stanford.edu](https://web.stanford.edu/~jhain/Paper/AJPS2015c.pdf). Niskanen Center also publishes [well-researched articles](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/trump-as-populist/) covering [both sides of an issue](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/libertarians-conservatives-stop-opposing-welfare-state/) to give a properly balanced perspective.
They mostly favor left-leaning activism such as a carbon tax, pro-climate change measures, and universal healthcare from an editorial perspective. For this reason, we rate them left-center biased and High factual.
