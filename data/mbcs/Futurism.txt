Analysis / Bias
In review, Futurism publishes news and information related to science and cutting-edge or future technologies. Articles often use minimal to moderate loaded language such as this:
[Deepfake Pioneer: “Perfectly Real” Fake Vids Are Six Months Away](https://futurism.com/pioneer-perfect-deepfake-six-months-away). This story, like all others, is correctly sourced to either scientific papers or credible news media outlets such as [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) and Technology Review.
The website also features a section called “The Byte,” where they take an article from another publication and summarize it, such as this:
[THIS SITE TURNS WIKIPEDIA PAGES INTO FAKE ACADEMIC PAPERS](https://futurism.com/the-byte/wikipedia-fake-academic-papers). Politically, Futurism reports only when it pertains to their genre. A search for articles on “ [Trump](https://futurism.com/search?q=trump)” shows relatively neutral language that avoids adding significant opinions.
