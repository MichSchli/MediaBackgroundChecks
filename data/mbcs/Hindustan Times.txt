History
Founded in 1924,
[The Hindustan Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times#cite_note-4) is a broadsheet format newspaper based in India. They cover local, national, and international news. [Read our profile on India’s Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/india-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Hindustan Times is owned by M.P. Shobhana Bhartia, who was nominated by Congress (2012), and hence the newspaper has a pro-Congress tone. (*The Congress is a secular party whose social liberal platform is generally considered the center-left of Indian politics).
[The KK Birla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times#Ownership) group owns a 69 percent stake in HT Media. Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hindustan Times reports national and international news with a left-leaning bias. Articles and headlines contain emotionally loaded language such as this
[Thackeray under pressure from Bollywood’ mafia’ to derail Sushant probe: Sushil Modi](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushil-modi-alleges-uddhav-under-pressure-from-bollywood-mafia-to-derail-sushant-probe/story-tl2IdKotiqEzvpHuVxBhJO.html). This story, like most, lacks hyperlinked sourcing. There is low bias when reporting on international news as they use credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and maintain factual reporting.
Editorially, they generally align with The Congress Party, the liberal opposition party to Modi’s conservative BJP party. The Congress Party advocates liberty, social justice, equality, the welfare state, and a progressive and secular society. We have also found evidence of promoting
[Pro-Russian propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M23CmqFfT70) such as this [‘The plunder of India’: Putin slams West as Russia annexes Ukraine’s 4 regions](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-plunder-of-india-putin-slams-west-as-russia-annexes-ukraine-s-4-regions-101664557764761.html). In general, the Hindustan Times aligns left politically and has several examples of promoting misinformation, as seen below in the failed fact checks.
