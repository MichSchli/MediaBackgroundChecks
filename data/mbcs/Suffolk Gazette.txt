Analysis / Bias
In review, the Suffolk Gazette disclaims they are a satire on their
[about page](https://www.suffolkgazette.com/about/) with this statement: “You couldn’t make it up. Suffolk is full of strange and wonderful stories, and our tales explode across social media and get repeated by gullible mainstream media, including [Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/) and national newspapers.” An example of a story is as follows [Woman ‘danced naked through village with carrot between buttocks](https://www.suffolkgazette.com/news/woman-carrot/). The Suffolk Gazette has also successfully duped major news outlets such as the [Daily Mirror,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mirror/) who picked up this fake news story: [Pensioner locked in loo for four days, knits scarf](https://www.suffolkgazette.com/news/pensioner-locked-in-loo/).
