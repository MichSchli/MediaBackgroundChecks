History
Founded in 1980, Australian Skeptics is a loose confederation of groups across Australia that investigate paranormal and pseudo-scientific claims from a responsible scientific viewpoint. According to their
[about page](https://www.skeptics.com.au/about/us/), they investigate claims that “range from what we might call the lighter end of the scale (UFOs, monsters, and ghosts) where the most you can lose is probably some money or a little time, to those very dark areas of psychic schemes and quack cures where the results can be dangerous, damaging or even fatal.” They also publish [The Skeptic Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/skeptic-magazine/).
