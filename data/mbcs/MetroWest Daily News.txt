Analysis / Bias
In review, MetroWest Daily covers local news through journalists with minimally loaded words such as this:
[Marijuana cultivator gets cityâ€™s approval to open in Framingham](https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20190322/marijuana-cultivator-gets-citys-approval-to-open-in-framingham). National and world news is covered by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Information is properly sourced and attributed correctly throughout the paper and website. Editorially, there is a reasonable balance between left and right-leaning opinions. However, there is more that lean left, and they never publish extremes.
