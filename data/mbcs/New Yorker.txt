History
The New Yorker Magazine was founded in 1925 by Harold Ross and his wife,
[Jane Grant](https://spartacus-educational.com/USAjane_grant.htm), and Raoul Fleischmann backed them. The magazine initially focused on social and cultural life in New York City; however, it later transformed into publishing short stories, cartoons, satire, poetry, essays, art reviews, fiction, and in-depth journalism. The New Yorker has had many famous contributors, including Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Alexander Woollcott, James Thurber, Sidney J. Perelman, Janet Flanner, Wolcott Gibbs, and St. Clair McKelway.
The New Yorker is divided into sections such as News, Culture, Books, BusinessTech, Humor, Cartoons, Magazine, and more.

Analysis / Bias
The New York Times
[reports](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/magazine/si-newhouse-and-conde-nast-taking-off-the-white-gloves.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=0668397DBAC73C3199990B3AE847DFB3&gwt=pay) that ”The Conde Nast philosophy, according to Newhouse, is to let the editors run free.”
In review, The New Yorker uses strong emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Don’t Underestimate Elizabeth Warren and Her Populist Message”](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/dont-underestimate-elizabeth-warren-and-her-populist-message) and [“Is Fraud Part of the Trump Organization’s Business Model?”](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/is-fraud-part-of-the-trump-organizations-business-model) The New Yorker also publishes satirical articles from satirist Andy Borowitz through his Borowitz Report, such as [“Trump Offers to Station Pence at Border with Binoculars in Lieu of Wall.”](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/trump-offers-to-station-pence-at-border-with-binoculars-in-lieu-of-wall) The Borowitz Report always favors the left and mocks the right. Further, The New Yorker provides original, in-depth journalistic reporting such as this: [Four Women Accuse New York’s Attorney General of Physical Abuse](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/four-women-accuse-new-yorks-attorney-general-of-physical-abuse?irgwc=1&source=affiliate_impactpmx_12f6tote_desktop_adgoal%20GmbH&mbid=affiliate_impactpmx_12f6tote_desktop_adgoal%20GmbH). The [result](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/nyregion/new-york-attorney-general-eric-schneiderman-abuse.html) of this investigation led to the Attorney General resigning just hours after the New Yorker published the story. In general, both wording and story selection tends to favor the left mostly.

Editorially, The New Yorker usually
[endorses Democrats,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_endorsements_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election) such as Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential Election.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/new-yorker/) found that 77% of the New Yorker’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 16% Mixed, and 6% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience strongly prefers the New Yorker.
