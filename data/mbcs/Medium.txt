Analysis / Bias
In review, Medium has a variety of writers from many different political perspectives. Therefore, the only way to check for bias is by sampling a variety of recently published articles. We chose the politics category as our gauge for bias. We sampled 25 top stories in their political section and found that 19 out of 25 or 76% leaned left. That doesn’t mean it represents the site’s entirety but indicates that more stories come from a left-leaning perspective.
We also searched for stories that promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. We found most were scientifically sound; however, there were some that presented
[anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and [GMO positions](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) as well as human-influenced [climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), geoengineering via [chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), and false flag operations. Lastly, because Medium publishes a wide variety of sources, there are times that they [fail fact checks](https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/feb/14/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claim-mitch-mcconnells-biggest-donor/). Again, this is not Medium’s fault. They simply are the “medium” for various sources, some of which may not be factual.
In general, Medium provides a mixed bag of stories that lean left, with some lacking evidence and sourcing.
