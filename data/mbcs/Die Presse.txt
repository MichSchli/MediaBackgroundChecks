Analysis / Bias
On the issues, Die Presse curates stories from The Austria Press Agency (APA) with balance and a positive tone toward immigration, such as this
[“Study: “Overall effect of migration on the state budget is positive](https://www.diepresse.com/5345453/studie-gesamteffekt-der-migration-auf-staatshaushalt-ist-positiv).” They also promote [environmentalism.](https://www.diepresse.com/5822737/der-rollentausch-als-vorbereitung-fur-die-klimadebatte)
Their national politics coverage, particularly regarding Sebastian Kurz, the former Conservative Chancellor, is neutral in tone and wording, representing all sides
[“Sebastian Kurz: “Unrestricted commitment to freedom of the press](https://www.diepresse.com/5808348/sebastian-kurz-uneingeschranktes-bekenntnis-zur-pressefreiheit).” Their coverage of opposition SPÖ party leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner (Center-Left) is slightly negative such as [“An SPÖ video without Pamela Rendi-Wagner”.](https://www.diepresse.com/5807181/ein-spo-video-ohne-pamela-rendi-wagner)
Lastly, Die Presse covers world news pertaining to the USA, such as the former Trump Administration, with a critical tone
[“Why Trump is now turning around in the protective mask.” ](https://www.diepresse.com/5842322/warum-trump-bei-der-schutzmaske-nun-umschwenkt)When it comes to sourcing Die Presse typically sources to themselves and uses quotes; however, they also utilize credible sources such as The Austria Press Agency (APA), [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), and [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/). In general, Die Presse reports news factually and with a slight conservative bias.
