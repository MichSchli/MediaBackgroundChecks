Blingnews.com usually sources to videos for their news articles and [sometimes hyperlinks](http://www.blingnews.com/during-uk-visit-trump-couldnt-believe-his-eyes-when-he-got-to-fulfill-lifelong-dream/) to credible media sources such as the [New York Times](http://www.blingnews.com/during-uk-visit-trump-couldnt-believe-his-eyes-when-he-got-to-fulfill-lifelong-dream/). However, BlingNews.com also has a [Pants of Fire claim](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/13/bling-news/fake-headline-says-new-york-times-said-trump-would/) according to Politifact.
