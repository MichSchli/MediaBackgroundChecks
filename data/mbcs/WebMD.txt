Analysis / Bias
In review, WebMD provides information on drugs and supplements, living healthy, family and pregnancy, and news & experts. Each of these is broken down into subcategories. Let’s cut to the chase. People come to WebMD to find out about drugs and diagnose medical conditions. While it is recommended to see an actual living doctor for these questions, WebMD is an excellent place to start and a great way to generate questions for your Doctor’s visit. They may roll their eyes, but it is better to be informed and ask the correct questions. With that said, WebMD is a pro-science source that is factual but not a hard science source.
