[The establishment appears to be trying to shut up this film for causing them headaches](https://unmuzzlednews.com/the-establishment-appears-to-be-trying-to-shut-up-this-film-for-causing-them-headaches/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on the information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Tim Allen attacked relentlessly in a woke tweet storm that didn’t end well for blue checkmarks](https://unmuzzlednews.com/tim-allen-attacked-relentlessly-in-a-woke-tweet-storm-that-didnt-end-well-for-blue-checkmarks/), and [Jen Psaki is shaking mad this lawsuit could end up causing her to leave NBC](https://unmuzzlednews.com/jen-psaki-is-shaking-mad-this-lawsuit-could-end-up-causing-her-to-leave-nbc/). Many stories on this website generally advance right-wing conspiracy theories and propaganda, sometimes using poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
