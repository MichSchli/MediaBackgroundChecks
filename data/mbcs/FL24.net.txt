Analysis / Bias
[According to the EU Disinfo Lab](https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/intra-eu-disinformation-the-french-website-managed-by-a-polish-far-right-network/), FL24.net “is a site that presents itself as a “French news website,” hiding both the fact that it was created in Poland in July 2019 and that it’s heavily tied to a controversial Polish far-right media network (Najwyższy Czas! & Wolnosc24).” The website covers polarizing topics, such as identity, religion, immigration, and insecurity, covering French news in detail and some international news. Articles and headlines contain loaded emotional wording that favors the right, such as who [ noticed the huge mistake in Macron’s speech?](https://fl24.net/2021/04/02/qui-a-remarque-lenorme-faute-dans-lallocution-de-macron/) This story is sourced from a credible French News source, ladepeche.fr. FL24.net does not perform original reporting but rather sources from credible media and inserts commentary to fit a far-right narrative.
