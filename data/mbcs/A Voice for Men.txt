History
[Founded in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Voice_for_Men), A Voice for Men (AVFM) is a men’s human rights advocacy site run by Paul Elam, the titular leader of America’s men’s rights movement. AVFM is not so much a news source as an extended blog and echo chamber consisting primarily of op-ed style content decrying the feminist movement and touting what Mr. Elam and other contributors see as the persecution of males in a female-run society. According to their [mission page, ](https://avoiceformen.com/policies/mission-statement/)“It is the mission of A Voice for Men to provide education and encouragement to men and boys; to lift them above the din of misandry, to reject the unhealthy demands of gynocentrism in all its forms, and to promote their mental, physical and financial well-being-without compromise or apology.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, A Voice for Men promotes anti-feminism and male chauvinism under the guise of diminished male rights. AVFM is one of the largest
[Men’s Rights Group](https://www.npr.org/2014/09/02/343970601/men-s-rights-movement). Articles and headlines on the website often contain emotionally loaded wording that favors the right such as this [President Trump’s succinct summary of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry](https://twitter.com/RaheemKassam/status/1368766417286365188). For most articles reviewed there is very little external sourcing for any of the content, and what source links I did follow led only to other anti-feminism opinion pieces and sites. The content is heavily weighted against feminism, and much of it revolves around the usual men’s rights issues. Divorce, custody, child support, men’s reproductive rights, etc. While this site is not explicitly mentioned as a hate group, it does strongly promote Misogyny and cannot be considered a credible source.
