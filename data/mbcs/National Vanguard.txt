In review, National Vanguard uses loaded emotional language in their articles and headlines such as: “
[Chicago: Blacks, “Fleeing Authorities,” Try to Hide in Police Station.](https://nationalvanguard.org/2017/09/chicago-blacks-fleeing-authorities-try-to-hide-in-police-station/)” They also use other extreme-right white extremist blogs as their sources, such as modernheretic3000. Further, the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/groups) lists National Vanguard as a white supremacist site.
Editorially they are fiercely anti-immigrant such as this
[Schrodinger’s Immigration Policy](https://nationalvanguard.org/2021/09/schrodingers-immigration-policy/). To put them in perspective, they often criticize former President Trump for his liberal policies regarding immigration and his support for Israel [Trump’s Latest Jew Criminal Pardon Spree](https://nationalvanguard.org/2020/12/trumps-latest-jew-criminal-pardon-spree/). In general, National Vanguard is one of the most despicable sites on the internet. It is amazing they are still online. They are the definition of a hate group. If you ever see a friend share a story from this group, the unfriend option should come quickly.
