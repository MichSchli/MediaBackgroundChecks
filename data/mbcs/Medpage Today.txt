Analysis / Bias
In review, Medpage Today has sections covering numerous specialties such as cardiology, dermatology, orthopedics, etc. The website covers healthcare policy stories, clinical research, general health, medical news, and scientific breakthroughs. Articles and headlines do not use loaded emotional language such as this
[Can PARP Inhibitor Eligibility Expand in Pancreatic Cancer?](https://www.medpagetoday.com/hematologyoncology/othercancers/91493) and this [MRI With Targeted Biopsy Matches Current Standard for ID’ing Prostate Cancer](https://www.medpagetoday.org/hematologyoncology/prostatecancer/91467?vpass=1). Further, all articles are sourced from either peer-reviewed studies or credible media outlets such as [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they cover politics related to healthcare, such as this
[COVID Relief Bill Contains Lots of Healthcare Provisions](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/91512). In general, political coverage is low-biased, and all information is factual.
