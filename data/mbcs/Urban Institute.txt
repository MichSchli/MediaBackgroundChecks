Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features research and news related to economic policy from a liberal perspective. Headlines and articles feature minimally loaded language such as this:
[Promoting Sustainability for Promise Neighborhood Grantees](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/promoting-sustainability-promise-neighborhood-grantees). This research is very well-sourced and researched.
Editorially, the Urban Institute leans left with policy positions that favor income equality, sustainable energy, and LGBTQ rights. When it comes to reporting on conservative positions such as housing, they report negatively, such as this:
[The Trump budget for unhealthy housing](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/trump-budget-unhealthy-housing). In general, news reporting is factual but with left-leaning editorial positions.
