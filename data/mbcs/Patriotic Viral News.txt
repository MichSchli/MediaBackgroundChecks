[Far Left Teachers Create List of Parents Who Disagree with Radical Progressive Agenda](https://www.patrioticviralnews.com/articles/far-left-teachers-create-list-of-parents-who-disagree-with-radical-progressive-agenda/), whereas the original article from the far-right [Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) is less sensational [VA teachers help create BLACKLIST of parents fighting critical race theory](https://www.glennbeck.com/radio/va-teachers-help-create-blacklist-of-parents-fighting-critical-race-theory). In general, on this site, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left with very poor sourcing utilized and zero transparency and hence not credible.
