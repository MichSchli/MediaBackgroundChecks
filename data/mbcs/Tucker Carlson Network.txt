He used to host “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” a nightly political talk show on [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/). The website [“Tucker Carlson Network”](https://tuckercarlson.com/) is a platform for his content in video form and merchandise.

Analysis / Bias
The main page features his videos hosted on the X platform and includes two sections: Videos and Shop. The website’s video section does not provide specific content, such as articles or blog posts. Videos showcase Carlson’s event appearances and show episodes with neutral titles, while merchandise like the “Lord Fauci Patron Saint of Wuhan” mug suggests skepticism towards mainstream scientific authorities.
Regarding the content within the video section, we analyzed a specific video, the most recent available during this evaluation, titled
[Tucker Carlson at the Turning Point Action Conference 2023](https://tuckercarlson.com/turning-point-action-2023/).” In this video, Tucker Carlson employs various techniques to frame issues in a way that aligns with a conservative viewpoint. For instance, at timestamp 29:01, Tucker Carlson suggests that the individuals at the Capitol on January 6th were those who most fervently believed in the American political process and were naturally the most shocked and upset to believe it wasn’t real, implying that he is sympathetic to their perspective.
Furthermore, he portrays
[Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) as a victim of Western aggression at the timestamp 00:12:40, suggesting a pro-Russian bias. At the timestamp 16:08, Carlson delves into the topic of Ukraine, using the analogy of a “self-appointed Christian leader” to question the moral authority of those advocating for [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/). He states, “And so I asked a self-appointed Christian leader about that,” subtly implying that their stance may not be as righteous as they claim. The mention of religion adds a moral dimension to the geopolitical issue, aiming to sway his audience through ethical considerations.
These framing techniques reveal Carlson’s effort to shape the narrative consistent with Trump’s conservatism. Carlson also brings up his own family and his role as a father, invoking the concept of patriarchy. Quote: “And if two of your kids are in a brawl…you say dad’s home knock it off.” Timestamp: 18:57-19:15. By doing so, he aims to establish himself as a traditional authority figure, lending weight to his opinions. He argues that leadership should bring order, likening international leadership to paternal leadership within a family. This analogy serves to simplify a complex geopolitical issue, framing it in terms that his audience may find more relatable.
Finally, at Timestamp 12:29, he declares that he knows “a ton of people injured” by the Covid-19 vaccine. This statement is provided without evidence. In general, Tucker Carlson promotes right-wing propaganda, conspiracies, and pseudoscience that is not always factual and lacks evidence to support claims.
