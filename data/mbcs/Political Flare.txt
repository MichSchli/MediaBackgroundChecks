Analysis / Bias
In review, Political Flare openly disclaims they are a left-leaning blog. Story selection always favors the left and frequently denigrates the right and in particular, former President Donald Trump such as this:
[Trump Removed All the Furniture Melania Chose for the W.H. and Replaced in With Tacky Gold Crap](https://www.politicalflare.com/2019/10/trump-removed-all-the-furniture-melania-chose-for-the-wh-and-replaced-in-with-tacky-gold-crap/) and this [People Think Trump Staged This Situation Room Photo Because Trump Was Actually Golfing When Raid Happened](https://www.politicalflare.com/2019/10/people-think-trump-staged-this-situation-room-photo-because-trump-was-actually-golfing-when-raid-happened/?utm_source=right-rail-latest). While this last story may be true or not, as of this review, it is a conspiracy theory published without evidence.
In general, this source is hyper-partisan in favor of the left while consistently denigrating the right through sensational wording and one-sided story selection. While Political Flare might be accurate at times, they jump the gun frequently to implicate Trump/Republicans and do not correct errors.
