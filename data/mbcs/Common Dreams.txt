Analysis / Bias
In review, Common Dreams primarily covers political news with a left-leaning bias in story selection and wording, such as
[‘Stop With This Recklessness’: Allies Warn Right-Wing Attacks Could Get Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Killed.](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/11/stop-recklessness-allies-warn-right-wing-attacks-could-get-congresswoman-ilhan-omar) This story is appropriately sourced to mostly left-leaning media such as [Splinter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/splinter/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/). In general, news reporting favors the left through story selection and the use of emotional wording. Editorially, Common Dreams features left-leaning writers such as Glenn Greenwald, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, and Paul Krugman. Needless to say, op-eds strongly favor the left. Many op-eds are opposed to [militarism](https://www.commondreams.org/war-peace) and promote the [need for action](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on [climate change](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/10/yet-another-handout-dirty-fossil-fuel-industry-trumps-newest-assault-environment).
