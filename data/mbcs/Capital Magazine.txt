Analysis / Bias
In general, economic and business-focused outlets often display biases toward free-market capitalism, fiscal policies, and business perspectives. The tone, language, and selection of news can subtly indicate a publication’s bias. We analyzed several articles from Capital.fr to assess its editorial slant.
For instance, the article on
[Emmanuel Macron’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/emmanuel-macron-france-facts-and-bias/) stance regarding [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/), titled [“War in Ukraine: Emmanuel Macron does not rule out sending Western troops,”](https://www.capital.fr/economie-politique/guerre-en-ukraine-emmanuel-macron-nexclut-pas-lenvoi-de-troupes-occidentales-1492857) suggests a portrayal that might resonate with center-right values, emphasizing strong leadership and international assertiveness.
Another piece,
[“FN assistants in the European Parliament: Marine Le Pen and 26 other people soon to be tried for embezzlement of public funds,”](https://www.capital.fr/economie-politique/assistants-du-fn-au-parlement-europeen-marine-le-pen-et-26-autres-personnes-bientot-jugees-pour-detournement-de-fonds-publics-1488155) uses specific terminology that could potentially cast a critical light on the far-right, aligning with center-right ideologies that aim to distance themselves from extremism.
Furthermore, the article titled “
[Gérald Darmanin denies making the “junction of the right with the extreme right,” as Jean-Luc Mélenchon believes”](https://www.capital.fr/economie-politique/gerald-darmanin-se-defend-de-faire-la-jonction-de-la-droite-avec-lextreme-droite-comme-lestime-jean-luc-melenchon-1478703) features Gérald Darmanin, France’s [right-wing interior minister, ](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2023/04/gerald-darmanin-france-emblematic-interior-minister-emmanuel-macron)responding to accusations from Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a left-wing political figure. Mélenchon accuses Darmanin of bridging mainstream right politics with the far-right, a claim Darmanin rebuffs by emphasizing his longstanding opposition to far-right figures like Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Darmanin’s defense and his mention of a political gaffe during a past encounter with Le Pen suggest an attempt to distance himself from extreme right ideologies. This coverage, alongside the portrayal of Sophia Chikirou and internal disputes within [Le Média](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/le-media-bias/) suggests Capital.fr employs a critical tone, particularly towards leftist figures and organizations, hinting at a right-leaning bias in their reporting approach.
These articles, among others, contribute to an understanding of Capital.fr’s editorial tendencies. While the outlet’s collaboration with reputable sources like
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and citing sources like [France Info ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-info/)and [RTL add](https://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/quelle-epoque-le-pen-trop-molle-darmanin-reconnait-une-erreur-de-debutant-politique-7900296217) a layer of credibility, the choice of topics and the framing of political figures suggest a subtle alignment with center-right perspectives.
