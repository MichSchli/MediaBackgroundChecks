Analysis / Bias
In 2021, Reporters Without Borders ranked
[Turkey](https://rsf.org/en/turkey) 153rd in the world for press freedom among 180 countries. According to Reporters Without Borders, “The witch hunt waged by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government against its media critics has come to a head since an abortive coup in July 2016. A state of emergency has allowed the authorities to eliminate dozens of media outlets with the stroke of a pen, reducing pluralism to a handful of low-circulated and targeted publications.”
In review, when reporting non-Turkey-related news, TRT World reports with
[minimally loaded language](https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/russia-s-bluff-on-counter-sanctions-17660) and utilizes credible sources such as [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), [Moscow Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/moscow-times/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) [Tass](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russian-news-agency-tass/) and republishes credible news agencies such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
TRT World reflects a
[pro-government tone](https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/are-kurdish-votes-a-determinant-of-june-24-elections--17269) in its national coverage, as seen through its analysis of the upcoming elections. Most national coverage heavily sided with the [ruling party](https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/a-merger-between-turkey-s-ak-party-and-nationalist-mhp-on-cards-17520) and less coverage of the [main opposition party candidate](https://www.trtworld.com/mea/turkey-s-chp-candidate-unveils-manifesto-at-election-rally-17595). Further, the [UK’s Spectator](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/11/president-erdogans-media-mouthpiece-aims-woo-west/) states TRT World is “President Erdogan’s mouthpiece to woo the west.” In short, this is a pro-government propaganda source.
Although TRT World presents relatively low biased coverage of USA news, such as “
[Trump cancels summit with Kim; North Korea still wants talks](https://www.trtworld.com/americas/trump-cancels-summit-with-kim-north-korea-still-wants-talks-17716),” they source through large blocks of quotes without providing any links to the sources.
