Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsservis.com is actually named “Today Breaking News” with a tagline that reads “Daily Chicago News.” Not surprisingly, there isn’t any news pertaining to Chicago. In fact, the website is essentially identical to fake news website
[Ajuanews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ajuanews-com/) as they publish the same stories. The news published on this website comes from an extreme right pro-Trump perspective and often is not factual. Headlines are emotionally loaded to favor the right such as this: [BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO RUN AS PRESIDENT OF KENYA IN 2021](http://newsservis.com/2020/01/19/barack-obama-announces-intention-to-run-as-president-of-kenya-in-2021/). This story is obviously fake. When it comes to sourcing information, Newsservis simply does not source at all. Quite simply this is a fake news website with zero credibility.
Despite Newsservis only being 1 month old at the time of this review they already failed fact checks.
