Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the content of the Peoples Gazette, the articles cover various topics, including politics, anti-corruption, rights, economy, and more. The headlines are sensational at times, such as “
[Femi Kuti says Obidients are zombies](https://gazettengr.com/femi-kuti-says-obidients-are-zombies/).” This article reports on Afrobeat musician Femi Kuti’s remarks about supporters of Nigerian Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi, referring to them derogatorily as “zombies.” The term, historically used by his father, Fela Kuti, to describe mindless followers, is applied here to criticize supporters of Obi.
The article presents these comments without apparent bias, offering direct quotes and a brief context for Kuti’s use of the term. However, the choice to report on this particular statement without providing a broader range of perspectives or reactions from the “Obedient” movement could suggest a subtle bias in story selection, potentially framing the movement negatively.
Another article, “
[Bola Tinubu’s Chicago files uncover the history of falsehood, forgery, and identity theft,”](https://gazettengr.com/austin-aneke-bola-tinubus-chicago-files-uncover-history-of-falsehood-forgery-and-identity-theft/#:~:text=Tinubu%20claims%20he%20attended%20the%20University%20of%20Chicago&text=He%20swore%20as%20follows%20%E2%80%9CI,was%20never%20a%20student%20there.) scrutinizes [President Bola Tinubu’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nigeria-media-profile/) claimed academic and professional background, contrasting his assertions with evidence implying dishonesty. Its assertive, accusatory tone suggests a bias, actively challenging Tinubu’s integrity. They cite through direct quotations from documents related to Bola Tinubu’s academic history. However, it does not provide hyperlinks or images of the original documents to verify these quotations, which is a critical practice for transparency and credibility in journalism.
In general, the Peoples Gazette does not demonstrate clear left-right bias; however, the lack of transparency and poor sourcing techniques reduces their credibility.
