History
Founded in 2018, The Freedom Times is a hyperpartisan conservative news and opinion blog. The website lacks transparency as the
[about page](https://www.thefreedomtimes.com/about/) does not disclose their political orientation, name editors, or disclose ownership. It appears the two primary authors are Lindsey Michelle and James Nicholas. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Freedom Times does not disclose ownership; revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Freedom Times does not perform original reporting but rather editorializes news stories using highly emotional wording such as this:
[Leo Terrell Rips Biden For Claiming Trump Is The First ‘Racist’ President: “Biden Is The Racist!”](https://www.thefreedomtimes.com/2020/07/23/leo-terrell-rips-biden-for-claiming-trump-is-the-first-racist-president-biden-is-the-racist/). This story is sourced to [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and Twitter. Story selection always favors the right and frequently uses poor sources such as [Tucker Carlson](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tucker-carlson/), who has failed numerous fact checks [Tucker Blasts Dr. Fauci For Taking Off Mask At Baseball Game: “Masks For Thee, But Not For Me’](https://www.thefreedomtimes.com/2020/07/25/tucker-blasts-dr-fauci-for-taking-off-mask-at-baseball-game-masks-for-thee-but-not-for-me/).
Although an IFCN fact checker has not directly fact-checked them, they frequently report and support former President Trump’s false claims, such as this
[Trump On Border Security: Joe Biden Is “Totally Controlled By The Radical Left… They Want Open Borders”.](https://www.thefreedomtimes.com/2020/06/23/trump-on-border-security-joe-biden-is-totally-controlled-by-the-radical-left-they-want-open-borders/) [AP Fact Check](https://www.thefreedomtimes.com/2020/06/23/trump-on-border-security-joe-biden-is-totally-controlled-by-the-radical-left-they-want-open-borders/) and [Factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/trump-distorts-bidens-immigration-plans/) states this is false. In general, The Freedom Times is far-right biased and does not always publish factual news.
