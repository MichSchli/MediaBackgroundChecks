History
Founded in 1989,
[Liberty Counsel](https://lc.org/about) is a nonprofit organization/Christian ministry that advocates religious freedom, the sanctity of human life, and family values through litigation, education, and public policy. However, contrary to its self-description, Liberty Counsel is designated as [a hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/liberty-counsel) by [The Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) (SPLC) for promoting anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and misinformation. The Liberty Counsel was founded by conservative activist Matthew Staver, an attorney, and his wife, Anita Staver, and operates from multiple locations in the United States, including Central Florida, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

Analysis / Bias
Liberty Counsel’s ideological leanings influence the framing of content and policy advocacy, potentially impacting the factual accuracy of their assertions. For instance, in their support for
[Sandra Merritt’s](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/duo-behind-anti-planned-parenthood-videos-could-finally-see-justice-112940/) actions against Planned Parenthood, as evident in the article “ [Liberty Counsel Asks Appeals Court To Dismiss Sandra Merritt Criminal Case,”](https://lc.org/newsroom/details/022024-liberty-counsel-asks-appeals-court-to-dismiss-sandra-merritt-criminal-case) they depict her undercover recordings as journalistic endeavors exposing wrongdoing, in line with their conservative Christian worldview. However, the broader legal context reveals complexities, exemplified by the [Supreme Court’s](https://www.courthousenews.com/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-key-cases-as-new-term-begins/) recent actions. In the case of Merritt v. Planned Parenthood, The Supreme Court affirmed the ruling of the Ninth Circuit, holding two anti-abortion activists accountable for their hidden-camera investigation. This selective portrayal overlooks the broader legal implications and [Planned Parenthood’s](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-10-26/planned-parenthood-fetal-tissue-entrapment-david-daleiden-sandra-merritt) claims of economic harm beyond reputational damage, potentially distorting the presentation of facts.
Liberty Counsel’s
[press releases](https://lc.org/newsroom/press-releases) often present their legal activities in cases that resonate with their conservative ideology, particularly on contested legal and social issues, which is evident in releases like’ [“SCOTUS To Decide First Amendment Issue in January 6 Prosecutions,”](https://lc.org/newsroom/details/020524-scotus-to-decide-first-amendment-issue-in-january-6-prosecutions) which suggests Liberty Counsel’s backing of the legal defense for the three defendants tied to January 6. Such legal engagements emphasize the organization’s ideological leanings.
When citing sources, Liberty Counsel appears to selectively reference outlets such as
[The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), which is rated as questionable by MBFC. However, they also utilize credible sources such as [Justia.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/justia-bias/)
Liberty Counsel sometimes integrates personal experiences, like dreams, to reinforce their positions. For instance, in this article titled “
[Urgent Prayer Request for President Trump…”](https://lc.org/newsroom/details/20201213-urgent-prayer-request-for-president-trump) they solicit urgent prayers and support for Former President Trump, drawing upon personal dreams and geopolitical concerns to justify their appeal.
Furthermore,
[The Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), an organization that tracks hate groups, designates Liberty Counsel as an [anti-LGBTQ hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2022/11/01/liberty-counsel-used-documents-gab-adf-its-anti-covid-vaccine-campaign) and criticizes its misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and collaboration with fringe groups. In summary, Liberty Counsel’s clear religious and ideological leanings present a far-right bias that could impact factual accuracy when intersecting with contested social and scientific topics.
