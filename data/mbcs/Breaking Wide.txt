Analysis / Bias
In review, Breaking Wide publishes summarized news stories from other sources. Headlines contain a moderate amount of loaded wording such as this
[Piers Morgan Suffers From Depression Seeing Americans Buying Guns In Historic Numbers](https://breakingwide.com/piers-morgan-suffers-depression-seeing-americans-buying-guns-in-historic-numbers/). However, within the article, the unnamed author opines with strong emotional language such as this “Piers Morgan is all depressed because Americans are re-discovering the glories of the Second Amendment after a rash of violent looting and rioting.” This story is sourced to a tweet and although they publish statistics from the FBI they do not provide a link to that information for verification. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left such as this [Watch Joe Biden’s Response When Confronted On Live Television If He Has Been Tested For Dementia](https://breakingwide.com/watch-joe-bidens-response-when-confronted-on-live-television-tested-for-dementia/). In general, the stories selected are factual news stories with the author adding biased conservative opinions.
