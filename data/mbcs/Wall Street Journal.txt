History
Launched in 1889, The Wall Street Journal is an international business newspaper concentrating on finance, investment, and corporate news. It is headquartered in New York City. The newspaper was
[founded](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/The_Wall_Street_Journal) by journalists Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser; together, they established the Dow Jones & Company, which led to The Wall Street Journal’s founding. They also began the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Charles Dow and Dow’s editorials invented, known as the “Dow theory” of market analysis.
According to
[The New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/) columnist Ken Auletta’s [article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/11/03/family-business-6) on November 3, 2003, and titled “Family Business,” after Charles Dow’s death on December 4, 1902, the company was bought by its Boston correspondent, Clarence Barron. After Barron died in 1928, the new owners were his stepdaughters, Jane and Martha. Jane Barron’s husband, Hugh Bancroft, took over the Wall Street Journal. He later committed suicide, and the company was left to the Journal’s editor, and since that time, the Bancroft family has not had an active management role.
Currently,
[Robert Thomson](https://newscorp.com/leader/robert-thomson/) is the chief executive of News Corp, and the WSJ editor-in-chief is [Matt Murray](https://www.wsj.com/articles/matt-murray-named-editor-in-chief-of-the-wall-street-journal-1528225040), who replaced Gerard Baker. [According to Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/05/wall-street-journal-baker-murray-627108), Baker faced criticism internally over the paper’s Pro-Trump coverage. [Paul A. Gigot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gigot) is the editorial page editor and [Vice President](http://www.wsj.com/news/author/5473) of The Wall Street Journal. He is also a conservative political commentator for [Fox News Channel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/).

Analysis / Bias
The Walls Street Journal hasn’t
[endorsed](http://mentalfloss.com/article/19951/brief-history-newspaper-endorsements) US political candidates since 1928; however, they are criticized for supporting far-right populist politicians abroad. For example, in South America, they [all but endorsed far-right Congressman Jair Bolsonaro](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazilian-swamp-drainer-1539039700) in [Brazil’s presidential election.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wall-street-journal-brazil-jair-bolsonaro-right-wing-authoritarians_us_5bbf6155e4b01a01d6883f6b) They have also [written favorably](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116588469033947024) about Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet. The WSJ has been strongly criticized for its pro-Trump coverage. According to [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), there was an [alleged conflict about how to cover Trump,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/conflict-over-trump-forces-out-an-opinion-editor-at-the-wall-street-journal/516318/) resulting in an opinion editor’s departure.
In review, the WSJ utilizes emotionally loaded language in their editorial headlines that favor the right, such as this: “
[Wrap It Up, Mr. Mueller Democratic dilemma: Impeach Trump for lying about sex?”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wrap-it-up-mr-mueller-1544398545) They also frequently promote [anti-climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) messages such as this: “ [The Phony War Against CO2.”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-phony-war-against-co2-1477955418) Here is another example from an editorial on Trump’s position on climate change [“Not the Climate Apocalypse: The EPA’s power rule won’t save coal and won’t poison the planet.”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-the-climate-apocalypse-1534894336) Further, IFCN fact checker [Climate Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-feedback/) has cited numerous editorials in which the Wall Street Journal uses [very low scientific credibility](https://climatefeedback.org/outlet/the-wall-street-journal/). The pro-science [Climate Science & Policy Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-science-and-policy-watch/) has also criticized the WSJ for [rejecting the 97% consensus of climate scientists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2014/05/27/shoot-and-a-miss-wall-street-journal-op-ed-attacks-97-climate-consensus/). Lastly, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/11/the-wall-street-journal-keeps-peddling-big-oil-propaganda) has an article describing how the WSJ “peddles big oil propaganda” while “disguising climate misinformation as opinion.”
When reporting regular news, the WSJ uses minimally loaded words such as this:
[China Agrees to Reduce Tariffs on U.S. Autos.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-agrees-to-reduce-tariffs-on-u-s-autos-11544548658?mod=hp_lead_pos2) News articles are also adequately sourced to credible media outlets like the [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/) and [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/wall-street-journal/) found that 41% of the Wall Street Journal’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 24% Mixed, and 35% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience slightly prefers them. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 46% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 27% do not, ranking them #4 in trust of the major USA news providers.
