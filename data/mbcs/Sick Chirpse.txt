History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/sickchirpse.com), Sick Chirpse is a hybrid satire and fake news source. A Whois search reveals the website originates from the UK. The [about page](https://sickchirpse.com/contact-us) does not indicate anything about the website or the owners. Since there is not an open disclaimer of Satire, we are assuming this is meant to be a fake news website to intentionally trick people into clicking and sharing.

Funded by / Ownership
The website does not list ownership and funding appears to primarily come from excessive advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, we must first look at the name of the website,
[Sick Chirpse](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sick%20Chirpse) means to “achieve an accomplishment of a high standard in the most impressive way while keeping your cool; It can be achieved by bending the truth.” The name of the website is a dead giveaway that they are not fully telling the truth and trying to trick you. Again, a Satire disclaimer somewhere on the website would give them credibility. We call this a hybrid site because some of these outrageous stories are true such as this one: [A Man Who Loved Riding On Top Of Passenger Trains Has Been Decapitated By A Bridge.](https://www.sickchirpse.com/man-loved-riding-top-passenger-trains-decapitated-bridge/) While this story provides zero sourcing, it is in fact [true](https://www.fayobserver.com/news/20181220/investigators-believe-man-decapitated-while-riding-atop-train). Sick Chirpse has also published outright fake news [here](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/self-denial/).
Sick Chirpse does not appear to have a political bias, but rather publishes shocking or fake news stories.
