[Art Pope](https://www.nccivitas.org/2012/civitas-announces-pope-resignation-from-boards/) was a founding member of both Civitas Institute and Civitas Action. [Art Pope ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Pope)is also the co-founder of the American conservative North Carolina think tank, the John Locke Foundation.
The Civitas Institute’s
[mission statement](https://www.nccivitas.org/mission/) indicates, “The Civitas Institute fights to remove barriers to freedom so that all North Carolinians can enjoy a better life.” This part of the mission statement shows how they will do that “We do this by exposing the truth about state government the mainstream media won’t tell you; by holding elected officials accountable when they support liberal policies; and by persistently fighting to give voice to those who feel they’re not being heard.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Civitas Institute has a strong right-wing bias in reporting as all information presented on their website is pro-right and anti-left. They occasionally use moderately loaded words and typically utilize proper sourcing for information. However, they sometimes link to Questionable sources such as the
[Witherspoon Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/witherspoon-institute/), which has funded [false scientific studies](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/suspect-science). The Civitas Institute also does not adhere to the [consensus of science](https://www.nccivitas.org/civitas-review/so-much-for-experts/) on environmental issues. On the issue of Transgenderism, they are misleading scientifically. In the article, “ [Transgenderism Has No Basis in Science or Law](https://www.nccivitas.org/2016/nobasisinscience/),” their claim that Transgenderism has no basis in science is wrong. There are numerous studies that show both a genetic and physical link to Transgenderism. [This article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-biology/born-this-way-researchers-explore-the-science-of-gender-identity-idUSKBN1AJ0F0) spells out where science is today.
In general, this is a far-right advocacy group that uses poor sources and does not align with the scientific consensus on some issues.
