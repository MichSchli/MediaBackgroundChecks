[New York court rulings signal trouble for New Jersey’s fresh attempt to regulate guns](https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/10/24/new-york-court-rulings-signal-trouble-for-new-jerseys-fresh-attempt-to-regulate-guns/).

On the issues, the New Jersey Monitor promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change.
