Analysis / Bias
In review, the Center for Public Integrity publishes in-depth journalistic research into corruption involving social and political issues. Topics tend to lean left, focusing on campaign finance, support for immigration, and workers’ rights. The website reports news with moderate to minimally loaded language such as this:
[A PATCHWORK OF ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS DON’T PROTECT LGBTQ WORKERS](https://publicintegrity.org/business/workers-rights/workplace-inequities/injustice-at-work/a-patchwork-of-anti-discrimination-laws-dont-protect-lgbtq-workers/). This story is appropriately sourced to Supreme Court documents and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/).
When it comes to reporting on the former administration, they have a negative tone regarding the former Trump administration. This is evidenced by this:
[NUMBER OF ICE DETAINEES WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORD RISES SHARPLY, DEFYING TRUMP RHETORIC](https://publicintegrity.org/immigration/ice-detainees-trump-criminal-record-syracuse-trac/). This story is also perfectly sourced.
Editorially, the CPI favors liberal policies and denigrates the conservative agenda. For example, the left-leaning
[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/) has [described](https://fair.org/?page=1149) CPI as “progressive,” as has the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-02-16-mn-36754-story.html), which has described them as “Liberal.”
