In review, +972 Magazine articles tend to lean left and are critical of the right-leaning Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. +972 Magazine utilizes emotionally loaded words in their headlines such as
[“Netanyahu will do all he can to destroy Jewish-Arab alliances”](https://972mag.com/netanyahu-will-do-all-he-can-to-destroy-jewish-arab-alliances/139103/) and [“’For many young American Jews, the Trump-Bibi axis is the enemy’”](https://972mag.com/for-many-young-american-jews-the-trump-bibi-axis-is-the-enemy/136504/), and [How Trump energizes deniers of Palestinian independence.](https://972mag.com/how-trump-energizes-deniers-of-palestinian-independence/131515/) Further, they typically utilize credible sources such [Haaretz,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/haaretz/) Die Tageszeitung, [New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and usip.org. In general, story selection is negative toward Israeli policy concerning the Palestinians.
