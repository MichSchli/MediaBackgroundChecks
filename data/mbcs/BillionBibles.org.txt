History
[Founded in 2007](http://whois.domaintools.com/billionbibles.org), BillionBibles.org is a blatant Christian Propaganda website that positively compares the Bible to the Quran. The website has a link for an about page that leads to a different domain (justbible.org), lists God’s laws, and glorifies Jesus. We could not find any names associated with this Questionable source.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website provides many links to information regarding Islam that paints it in a negative light. One link is titled
[Stop Islam](http://www.billionbibles.org/sharia/stop-islam.html), in which they present a 10 step plan on how to stop Islam. Here is a sample of their advice “Realize that Islam cannot penetrate where Christianity is strong. The entry and spread of Islam in “Christian” nations indicate a spiritual void where religiosity has replaced the [True Gospel.”](http://www.billionbibles.com/true-gospel.html) Essentially, the entire gist of this website is that Christianity is good and Islam is very, very bad. If you want to see where this website is going, you must view the side-by-side comparison of [Jesus Vs. Muhammad](http://www.billionbibles.org/sharia/jesus-vs-muhammad.html). According to them, Jesus was the Creator and Muhammad a Creature. In short, BillionBibles is not credible at all, and if they were a larger website, it would have been classified as an anti-Muslim hate group by now. For now, they are on the SPLC’s [Hatewatch list.](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/03/08/searching-sharia-anti-muslim-propaganda-ranks-high-google-search)
