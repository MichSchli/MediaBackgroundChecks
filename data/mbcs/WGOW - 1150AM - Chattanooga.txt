Analysis / Bias
WGOW – 1150AM – Chattanooga publishes local news stories that utilize minimally loaded language, such as this:
[Cleveland Police searching for fatal hit and run suspect](https://www.wgowam.com/). This story, like all other local stories, did not provide hyperlinked sourcing to the information.
The radio station and website broadcasts a daily lineup of news radio hosts who generally hold conservative perspectives. They also feature nationally syndicated Cumulus hosts like
[Dan Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dan-bongino-bias-rating/) and [Mark Levin](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mark-levin-bias-rating/), who have poor fact-check records.
Editorially, the majority of radio hosts hold conservative viewpoints. While local news reporting is usually not opinionated, they do republish opinionated political content from other sources, such as the questionable
[Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), which is a source known to advance conspiracy theories and misinformation. In general, local news appears to be fact-based but not properly sourced. Radio shows exhibit a conservative bias and sometimes promote misleading or false claims.
Failed Fact Checks
