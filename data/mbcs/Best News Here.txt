Analysis / Bias
Best News Here publishes news and information in big, bold print that always favors the right and routinely promotes pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. For example, they often publish disinformation related to Covid-19 such as this
[Dr. Sherri Tenpenny: MD’s Agree The Covid Vaccine Is A Bioweapon!](https://bestnewshere.com/dr-sherri-tenpenny-mds-agree-the-covid-vaccine-is-a-bioweapon-banned-must-video/) Sherri Tenpenny frequently makes false claims about Covid-19 such as spoons sticking to people’s faces due to magnetism in the Covid-19 vaccine. [Obviously, this is not true](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/09/sherri-tenpennys-bizarre-anti-vaccine-testimony-was-long-time-coming/).
While
[pro-Trump propaganda](https://bestnewshere.com/trump-vs-the-establishment-clash-of-the-titans-the-end-of-the-cabal-an-epic-battle-of-good-vs-evil/) and anti-vaccine conspiracies are common, they also publish conspiracies regarding [HAARP](https://bestnewshere.com/playing-god-haarp-weather-control-a-terrifying-look-at-the-control-of-weather-warfare/) (weather control), QAnon, 9/11 conspiracies, and stories from purveyors of disinformation such as [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) and [X22 Report.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/x22-report/) Best News Here is a typical fake Macedonian news site that preys on conservatives and conspiracy theorists for clicks. We would more appropriately name this website Worst News Here.
