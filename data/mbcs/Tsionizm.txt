Analysis / Bias
Tsionizm is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate news source. All of the websites use a similar design template.
The website publishes news related to
[Israel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/) that routinely favors the right and denigrates [Palestine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/palestine-government-and-media-profile/), such as this: [Hamas Enablers](https://tsionizm.com/opinion/2023/10/21/hamas-enablers/). This article is republished from the questionable [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right, particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [Israel Erupts As OBiden Purposefully Destroys Trump Peace](https://tsionizm.com/news/2021/05/10/israel-erupts-as-obiden-purposefully-destroys-trump-peace/). At the same time, denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [Blame George Soros For The Pot Stench Ruining America’s Cities And Addicting Her Citizens](https://tsionizm.com/analysis/2023/08/10/blame-george-soros-for-the-pot-stench-ruining-americas-cities-and-addicting-her-citizens/).
Tsionizm also promotes
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://tsionizm.com/video/2022/10/06/breaking-ccp-military-manufacturing-vaccines-bioweapon-destroying-the-west/). In general, this is an imposter website that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
