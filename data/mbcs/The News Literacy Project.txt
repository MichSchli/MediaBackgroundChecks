Analysis / Bias
While focused primarily on programs and projects for students, NLP also carries some news content. As might be surmised, those articles also center around sorting fact from fiction in print and online media. The reporting in NPL’s reports is fair and balanced, with links to credible sources and material.
NLP has a broad range of contributing journalists, including Stephanie Zimmerman (
[ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/)) and Bryan Gruley ( [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/)). Due to its work for students, the News Literacy Project and its dedication to truth in journalism easily earn a Least Biased rating.
