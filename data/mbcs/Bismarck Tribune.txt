Analysis / Bias
In review, the Bismarck Tribune covers local news with journalists and reporters throughout the Southern North Dakota region. For national news, they use the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). All news is reported with minimal loaded words and bias. The Bismarck Tribune always sources its information correctly. [Editorially](http://bismarcktribune.com/opinion/editorial/i-do-see-it-as-changing-the-goalposts/article_572a88f5-58c9-5f9d-a7bc-77a5943caf4b.html), there is a balance between right and left-leaning opinions with just a slight edge to the right. Ballotpediaâ€™s [presidential endorsements](https://ballotpedia.org/The_Bismarck_Tribune) vary with Democratic Candidate John Kerry in 2004, Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012, again with a slight edge to the right.
