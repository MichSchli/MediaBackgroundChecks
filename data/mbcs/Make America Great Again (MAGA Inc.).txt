Analysis / Bias
The content on MAGA Inc. strongly favors
[Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and his policies, particularly in economics and immigration. It is critical of the Biden Administration and Democratic policies. The site features articles and content that praise Trump’s economic policies and criticize [Biden’s handling of various issues](https://www.magapac.com/news/c4d62675-8c4d-4164-8646-19b0a17d701e). For instance, one article praises Trump’s economic achievements, while another criticizes Biden’s immigration laws.
The website publishes news summaries that either champion former President Trump or denigrate President Joe Biden or Trump’s Republican opponents like this
[Biden to Bring Lies and Excuses to Superior, Wisconsin](https://www.magapac.com/news/3c9cba4a-743c-4c86-a2b5-cea59bce117a) and [If Haley couldn’t win New Hampshire, she probably won’t win anywhere’.](https://www.magapac.com/news/a5ac3bbf-e0bf-4138-b4f7-ce0559d1b34d) Finally, there is significant evidence that they routinely publish false or misleading information in political advertising, as seen below in failed fact checks.
