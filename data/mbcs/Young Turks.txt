History
[Founded in 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Turks) as a radio program, The Young Turks (TYT) is now an American political commentary web series created by journalist Cenk Uygur, Ben Mankiewicz, and Dave Koller. Currently co-hosted by Uygur and Ana Kasparian, although its primary focus is on political commentary, it provides opinions on topics of varying news genres.
Launched in 2006, TYT was the first daily streaming online talk show. In 2017, TYT won a Webby Award for best YouTube Presence, and on May 17, 2018, The Young Turks launched a 24-hour linear channel on YouTube TV, which includes all of TYT’s current shows and four new shows called The Damage Report, “#NoFilter,” “The Happy Half Hour” and “Old-School Sports.”

Analysis
In review, The Young Turks produces progressive left video news programming and written articles on their website. Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[Rep. Rashida Tlaib was sworn in using Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the Quran, and, of course, people were mad.](https://tyt.com/watch/6e6Xst82zYACGGyweSOkMg/3A56DlpBwcgQkKme826ykm/episodes/Ld07H4HyeacysagI4UYqm) And [For Tucker Carlson Sponsors, Immigration is Complicated](https://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4uKagy0oyMA/30xo0WcXoIa2eqKmE6uMWQ). TYT tends to source its information from credible media outlets such as The [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), Sec.gov, and [Open Secrets](https://tyt.com/stories/4vZLCHuQrYE4uKagy0oyMA/30xo0WcXoIa2eqKmE6uMWQ). The Young Turks tend to support progressive candidates such as [Bernie Sanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-the-young-turks-and-their-viewers-love-bernie-sanders/2016/05/27/bd15e02e-2386-11e6-aa84-42391ba52c91_story.html?utm_term=.e240f061c63a) and [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtqQEHMzqKM). In general, all news reporting favors the left and [aggressively attacks the right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE4Fnx5NK9A).
Bias
TYT generally supports the consensus of science on most issues; however, they tend to
[promote propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jeuv9i0fPQ) that points to the dangers of GMOs and Glyphosate when it comes to GMOs. In this video, [Ana Kasparian said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23r2zIynato&t=5m9s): “I think that it’s a little naive to make the assumption that scientists won’t get corrupted by money because scientists obviously have an incentive to support GMOs.” This statement seems logical on the surface, but it is extremely broad and not supported by any evidence. The Young Turks have also [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu-0-JGlKfc) Anti-GMO activist Jill Latiano Howerton and her involvement in educating consumers about GMOs’ dangers. Jill Latiano Howerton was the executive producer of the film [GMO OMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMO_OMG), panned for promoting Pseudoscience.
Finally, they have promoted the Seralini GM Maize Feeding study, which has been
[widely debunked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524344/). In general, Young Turks are pro-science when it comes to [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and vaccines; however, with GMOs, they tend to float pseudoscience, usually to connect Monsanto to wrongdoing. Some of the Young Turk’s commentaries regarding Monsanto are accurate as they have been caught [manipulating data.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843257) This does not change the fact that scientific consensus indicates that GMOs are safe and Glyphosate a minimal risk.
