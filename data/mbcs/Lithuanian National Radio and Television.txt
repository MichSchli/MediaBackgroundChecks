Analysis / Bias
In review, LRT uses emotionally loaded language in their headlines when reporting news from Lithuania, such as
[“Lithuania’s liberals take aim at Labour Day – again.”](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1850468/lithuania-s-liberals-take-aim-at-labour-day-again) However, the body of the article is relatively balanced, quoting different perspectives. Regarding sourcing, hyperlinks are not used, and articles are generally sourced through quotes. Here is another article with emotionally loaded wording criticizing the government “ [Electricity bills are higher than rent.’ Lithuanian restaurants under energy squeeze.” ](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1785176/electricity-bills-are-higher-than-rent-lithuanian-restaurants-under-energy-squeeze)
When it comes to reporting news from around Europe, LRT republishes articles utilizing credible sources such as
[ERR news](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/err-news-estonia-public-broadcasting/) (Estonia Public Broadcasting), RTBF (Belgian public service broadcaster), and [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) ( French news agency). When reporting U.S. news, LRT News generally uses neutral wording: [“Lithuania’s Nausėda meets with U.S. President Biden in New York ](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1785734/lithuania-s-nauseda-meets-with-us-president-biden-in-new-york) and [“U.S. president Biden signs defense bill, authorizes $150m for Baltic security.”](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1571932/us-president-biden-signs-defence-bill-authorises-150m-for-baltic-security)
Editorially, most articles and opinion pieces are relatively balanced, presenting differing perspectives. There is a slight left-leaning bias in editorials, but not enough to move this source from the Least Biased category.
