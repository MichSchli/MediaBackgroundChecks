History
Naturally Savvy is a website that publishes organic and natural healthy living recipes and news. Before I dig deeper I want to point out the positives of this website. First, they have a credible
[about page](http://naturallysavvy.com/about-us) that describes their mission. They provide [bios](http://naturallysavvy.com/bios) for their writers, and they source their information. All of that is good. Naturally Savvy also provides many credible articles about nutrition that are scientifically based. While promoting organic eating is a great cause, it can also be misleading as there is very little evidence to support that not eating organically is harmful.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Naturally Savvy is well sourced to mostly credible sources, however, sometimes they use strong pseudoscience sources such as
[Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/). Naturally Savvy does not always support the consensus of science when it comes to [GMOs](http://naturallysavvy.com/eat/is-monsanto-s-gm-corn-causing-gluten-intolerance). While not overt in their dismissal of [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), they work to place doubt with dubious scientific studies. Naturally Savvy does not come out and say they are anti-vaccine like many websites in the so-called holistic health genre; they do, however, try to [create doubt](http://naturallysavvy.com/care/vaccine-safety-what-you-need-to-know-about-these-7-additives-in-vaccines). Finally, Naturally Savvy is almost a pro-science source. They source well, but they cast doubt on some issues supported heavily by science.
