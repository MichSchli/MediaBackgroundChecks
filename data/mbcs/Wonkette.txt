Analysis / Bias
In review, Wonkette is a hybrid website that publishes satirical content mixed with real factual news. One consistency is the use of sharp sarcasm that always denigrates the right. Headlines and stories always contain loaded emotional language and quite often profanity:
[In The Matter Of Diamond And Silkâ€™s Very Real Lawyer v. Wonkette: Bring It, Sh*thead](https://www.wonkette.com/diamond-silk-cease-and-desist).
The majority of stories are highly negative toward conservatives and, in particular, former President Trump, such as this:
[Obvious Omarosa Says Trump Wants A Race War. We Say YA THINK?](https://www.wonkette.com/obvious-omarosa-says-trump-wants-a-race-war-we-say-welcome-to-reality) Wonkette generally sources its information from credible media outlets such as The [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and then adds biased commentary to support a liberal narrative.
