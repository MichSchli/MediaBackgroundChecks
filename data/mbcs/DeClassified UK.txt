Analysis / Bias
Declassified UK publishes articles regarding the monarchy with emotionally loaded wording, such as
[“The Monarchy Rests on a Lie: The UK Needs an Elected Head of State.”](https://declassifieduk.org/the-monarchy-rests-on-a-lie-the-uk-needs-an-elected-head-of-state/) The article presents a critical perspective on the monarchy and advocates for an elected head of state. Additionally, the article criticizes mainstream media, particularly the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), for soft-pedaling or ignoring stories related to royal lobbying and accusations of cash for honors.
Regarding issues such as climate change, the article
[“Exclusive: UK Military and Arms Companies Produce More Carbon Emissions Than 60 Individual Countries”](https://declassifieduk.org/exclusive-uk-military-and-arms-companies-produce-more-carbon-emissions-than-60-individual-countries/) presents a critical perspective on the role of the UK military and arms companies in contributing to climate change, therefore having a left-leaning bias on the issue. According to the article, SGR conducted research that found that the UK military and arms companies produce more carbon emissions than 60 individual countries. The source mentioned in the article is Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR), a UK-based membership organization that promotes responsible science and technology.
