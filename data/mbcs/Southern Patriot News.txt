Analysis / Bias
In review, Southern Patriot News summarizes news stories from other sources and often changes the headline to be attention grabbing such as this:
[Kamala Harris is Dead in the Water](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/kamala-harris-is-dead-in-the-water/). This story comes from [Fox News.](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/kamala-harris-is-dead-in-the-water/) Story selection always favors the Right and in particular President Donald Trump such as this: [Trump Scores Major Immigration Victory with Supreme Court Ruling](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/trump-scores-major-immigration-victory-with-supreme-court-ruling/) ( [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)). News articles also frequently denigrate Democratic politicians such as this: [AOC Sells Out Former Chief of Staff](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/aoc-sells-out-former-chief-of-staff/) (Fox News). Lastly, Southern Patriot News publishes [political cartoons](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/the-democrat-party-diversity-and-change-not/) that denigrate the left. Further, articles often contain commentary from the author that uses highly emotional terminology [such as this](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/biden-threatens-air-force-veteran-after-being-confronted-on-iraq-war-vote/) “Well, we have just seen a new low by Joe Biden but yet more proof he loves to use the death of his son Beau to evoke empathy and get him out of sticky situations.” [And this:](https://www.southernpatriotnews.com/174-democrats-vote-against-tsa-legislation-amendment-to-block-hiring-sexual-offenders-and-those-with-terrorist-ties/) “How insane is the radical left right now? Well, actually, how insane is the left, period?”
