Analysis / Bias
In review, there is significant use of loaded emotional language in their titles, such as
[NATO Sacrifices Global Stability on Altar of Its ‘Punish Putin’ Strategy](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2022/09/351284/nato-sacrifices-global-stability-on-altar-of-its-punish-putin-strategy).
When it comes to sourcing, they mainly use factual and factually mixed sources such as Carnegieeurope.eu, and
[truthout.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-out/).
Morocco World News (MVN) also publishes pro-Morocco monarch articles such as
[“King Mohammed VI Calls for Action Against Climate Change, Desertification”](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2022/05/348919/king-mohammed-vi-calls-for-action-against-climate-change-desertification) and [“King Mohammed VI Calls For Business-Friendly Climate For Moroccan Diaspora.”](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2022/08/350891/king-mohammed-vi-calls-for-business-friendly-climate-for-moroccan-diaspora) Further, they promote pro-conservative and monarchist Istiqlal party such as [“Al Istiqlal: Recent Reforms Constitute a ‘Social Revolution’ in Morocco.”](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2021/04/338976/al-istiqlal-recent-reforms-constitute-a-social-revolution-in-morocco)
An example of pro-monarch propaganda can be seen when reporting positively on the economy
[“Morocco’s Economic Growth Expected to Reach 4.5% in 2023”.](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2022/07/350502/moroccos-economic-growth-expected-to-reach-4-5-in-2023) However, other news outlets report critical information regarding Morocco’s economy: [“Morocco: Mohammed VI’s silence on the country’s woes speaks volumes.”](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/morocco-king-mohammed-silence-woes-speaks-volumes) In general, Morocco World News holds a Right-Center bias in reporting through the promotion of pro-Monarch propaganda.
