History
The Pluralist is a news and opinion website that covers politics, the media, and culture. According to their
[about page](https://www.pluralist.com/about): “Pluralist is a tabloid that covers the U.S. culture wars. Our beat is the absurd, the hypocritical, and the surreal. We try to counter conventional media narratives and get at what’s really at stake in the news.” According to the [masthead](https://pluralist.com/about/) the three founders are Juan Leon, Andrew Tobin, and Adaam James Levin-Areddy.

Funded by / Ownership
The Pluralist is owned by Minute Media. They appear to be funded by an over-abundance of advertising that bogs down the website to a crawl. While we understand the need for advertising to survive (we do it), there are limits and they exceed them. Ad Blocker blocked 18 ads on one article. Again, ads are essential and I do not personally use my adblocker because I want the media to remain free and for sites to make money, but this is a bit much and a burden to the viewer.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Pluralist uses strong loaded language in their headlines such as this:
[‘Own the Libs Day’ Was Too Good to Be a Coincidence. Here’s What Really Happened.](https://pluralist.com/own-the-libs-day-was-too-good/) The Pluralist generally sources information to high factual credible media outlets, however, they sometimes utilize factually mixed right biased sources such as the [Washington Free Beacon](https://pluralist.com/own-the-libs-day-was-too-good/) and the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). Story selection tends to favor the right such as this: [AOC Blames Immigration on Right-Wing Plot to Hide Climate Change](https://pluralist.com/ocasio-cortez-immigration-climate-change/), which portrays the left negatively. Editorially, virtually all opinions favor the right. In general, the Pluralist is indeed a sensational tabloid with a strong right-leaning bias and reasonable sourcing to mostly factual outlets.
