Analysis / Bias
Alt News provides a
[methodology](https://www.altnews.in/transparency-of-funding/) that explains how they fact check and their methods. According to [First Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/first-post/), Alt News describes its [purpose](https://www.firstpost.com/india/how-alt-news-is-trying-to-take-on-the-fake-news-ecosystem-in-india-3513879.html) as to “act as an antidote to the right-wing propagandists that have established themselves in the mainstream media.”
In review, Alt News primarily fact checks videos to see if they are real and properly labeled to the source. In general, they fact-check claims that would appeal most to those who lean left and are critical of
[Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party)) (current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi’s right-wing party). For the most part, the primary purpose of this site is to refute claims made in social media that are in video format. Still, they do look at others as well, such as this: [“Fake news: Kerala government arrested a Sabarimala child protester.” ](https://www.altnews.in/fake-news-kerala-government-arrested-a-sabarimala-child-protester/)
Alt News frequently uses emotionally loaded language in its headlines, such as
[ “Sensationalism, sleaze, and misogyny – the other face of right-wing propaganda.”](https://www.altnews.in/sensationalism-sleaze-and-misogyny-the-other-face-of-right-wing-propaganda/) When it comes to sourcing, Alt News sources social media and credible sources such as [Indian Express](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-indian-express/) and [firstpost.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/first-post/). While Alt News sometimes attempts to debunk misinformation against the BJP, such as here [“No, Yogi Adityanath did not laugh at Pulwama martyr’s funeral; old video goes viral,”](https://www.altnews.in/no-yogi-adityanath-did-not-laugh-at-pulwama-martyrs-funeral-old-video-goes-viral/) they almost exclusively fact-check those that favor the left and are opposed to the BJP.
In an interview published by
[Caravan Magazine](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/alt-news-pratik-sinha-fake-news-election), Sinha replied, “We [Alt News] started in February 2017. The first year was completely dominated by the right wing regarding misinformation put out. But now, there are several pages that do pro-Congress propaganda.” In other words, they are not just fact-checking the BJP government.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years. They are fact-checkers.
