History
Founded in 1974, The
[Congressional Budget Office (CBO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office) is a federal agency within the legislative branch of the United States government that provides budget and economic information to Congress. The Congressional Budget Office is nonpartisan and produces “independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process.” Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation without issuing any policy recommendations. The CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the [Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_and_Impoundment_Control_Act_of_1974).

Analysis / Bias
Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation without issuing any policy recommendations. There is a consensus among economists that “the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals.” In other words, the CBO tends to favor whoever is in charge. (we didn’t say that). For example, during the Biden administration, they focus on the budget and how it relates to climate change
[Budgetary Effects of Climate Change and Potential Legislative Responses to It](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57019). While during the Trump Administration, they look at different metrics such as this [Analysis of the Long-Term Costs of the Administration’s Goals for the Military](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53350).
They are least biased despite often being criticized by both sides when their reports are not favorable to that side. The CBO is the most credible agency for factual budget projections as they are paid to do so.
