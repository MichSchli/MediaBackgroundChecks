Analysis / Bias
In review, Genesius Times appropriately disclaims on every page “THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCE OF FAKE NEWS ON THE PLANET.” Satirical stories are often at the left’s expense, such as this:
[Mexican government hires Beto to confiscate all the drug cartel guns](https://genesiustimes.com/mexican-government-hires-beto-to-confiscate-all-the-drug-cartel-guns/), and this [Hillary enters 2020 race after entire Democratic field have surprise heart attacks](https://genesiustimes.com/hillary-enters-2020-race-after-entire-democratic-field-have-surprise-heart-attacks/). In general, this is a satire source that would appeal to those on the right or perhaps those on the left with a good sense of humor.
