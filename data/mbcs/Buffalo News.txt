Funded by / Ownership
Lee Enterprises owns and publishes the Buffalo News. According to
[Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), Lee Enterprises donated 88% of its money to [Republican politicians](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000052990&cycle=2014) from 1990 until 2016. However, during the 2020 election cycle, they donated 70% to Democratic candidates and causes. Advertising and subscription fees generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Buffalo News reports local news of the Niagara Falls – Buffalo metro area through staff reporters with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Tonawanda man charged in Texas de Brazil Galleria shooting, prosecutors say](https://buffalonews.com/2020/03/06/stolen-gun-used-in-texas-de-brazil-galleria-shooting-prosecutors-say/). The newspaper and website does not really cover national and international news, but rather focus on New York State.
Editorially, Buffalo News covers both sides with little difference in coverage. However, they have endorsed Democratic candidates in the past such as
[President Obama in 2012](https://buffalonews.com/2012/10/28/despite-shortcomings-obama-is-the-better-choice/) and Democratic nominee [Hillary Clinton in 2016](https://buffalonews.com/2016/10/27/editorial-clintons-experience-trumps-faults-leave-voters-one-realistic-choice/). However, since coming under the ownership of Lee Enterprises, they have moved to the right to become a least biased paper.
