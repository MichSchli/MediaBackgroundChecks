Editorially, the opinion page tends to cover both sides with a slight lean right in topic selection. When it comes to [endorsements](https://www.theledger.com/news/99999999/election-editorials-campaign-issues-and-the-ledger-recommends), this paper tends to endorse more Republicans by a strong margin, and they endorsed Donald Trump in 2016 for President. All information is typically sourced properly, and opinions and news are labeled as such.
