Analysis / Bias
China Digital Times is sponsored by Open Society Institute, owned by billionaire investor George Soros who actively criticizes China such as here
[“Soros urges Trump to maintain pressure on China’s Xi.”](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-china/news/soros-urges-trump-to-maintain-pressure-on-chinas-xi/) Further, they frequently publish stories that reflect Soros’ views on China.
In review, China Digital Times publishes articles with emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“MINITRUE: DO NOT REPORT ON WITHDRAWAL OF HK EXTRADITION BILL.”](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2019/09/minitrue-do-not-report-on-withdrawal-of-hk-extradition-bill/) In another article with emotionally loaded language, they report, [“BEIJING FINDS PROPAGANDA OPPORTUNITY IN WIDESPREAD U.S. UNREST](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2020/06/beijing-finds-propaganda-opportunity-in-widespread-u-s-unrest/).” When it comes to sourcing, they use media sources that fit their anti-CCP narrative, among them [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Wikipedia,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/) [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/).
In addition, we compared articles on how other sources covered a similar incident, such as these two articles about China’s Sharper Eyes Project. First, According to Japanese media source
[Asia Nikkei](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nikkei-asian-review/) with a headline titled [“China’s ‘sharp eyes’ offer chance to take surveillance industry global](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-s-sharp-eyes-offer-chance-to-take-surveillance-industry-global),” they state “Trade war tensions threaten overseas ambitions of public safety players: China’s security industry is booming, driven by Beijing’s drive to install state of the art surveillance technology on every street corner. Now, however — just as many companies are beginning to succeed in markets beyond China’s borders — a new front may be opening up in Washington’s trade war with China that could hinder those overseas ambitions.”
China Digital Times, on the other hand, reported the same incident with this headline
[“SHARPER EYES: SURVEILLING THE SURVEILLERS”](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2019/09/sharper-eyes-surveilling-the-surveillers-part-1/) with a quote from the article that reads “This Communist Party slogan was heavily used during the Cultural Revolution, an era in which citizens were incentivized to spy on and even falsely accuse family and neighbors of being disloyal to authority. More than 50 years after that tumultuous era began, the slogan has been reincarnated in an ambitious and highly invasive surveillance program called Sharp Eyes” In this case, the China Digital Times article reports negatively, focusing on how the Chinese government is spying on its citizens. In general, the news is primarily factual; however, they consistently report negatively on the Chinese Government.
