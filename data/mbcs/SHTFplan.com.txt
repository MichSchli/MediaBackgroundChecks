Analysis / Bias
SHTFPlan.com frequently promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience using highly emotional language such as this
[TOTAL TYRANNY: WE’LL ALL BE TARGETED UNDER THE GOVERNMENT’S NEW PRECRIME PROGRAM](https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/total-tyranny-well-all-be-targeted-under-the-governments-new-precrime-program). They republished this story from the Rutherford Institute. When clicking on a story with a highly questionable headline [BIDEN & HARRIS GUILTY OF UNIMAGINABLE CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN !!!](https://www.sgtreport.com/2021/05/biden-harris-guilty-of-unimaginable-crimes-against-children/), they indicate that they have been banned by other platforms: “ALERT: On October 15, 2020, YouTube terminated BOTH SGT Report YouTube channels without warning or cause. On October 22, 2020, Patreon terminated the SGT Report Patreon page without warning or cause. This is economic warfare, friends.” One would assume this is due to publishing and dangerous information as it relates to Covid-19 and vaccines.
SHTFplan generally promotes conspiracies and pseudoscience that appeal to the right, such as
[climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), and fear of socialism. This source totally lacks credibility and produces low factual content.
