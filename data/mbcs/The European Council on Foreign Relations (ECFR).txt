Analysis / Bias
In review, The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) utilizes loaded language in their headlines:
[“How Britain Lost Its Cool](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_how_britain_lost_its_cool_7236),” and typically, they use credible sources such as [The Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and [project-syndicate.org.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-syndicate/) Further, they also utilize local sources related to the specific country, such as [welt.de](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article171678626/Oesterreich-Ungarn-ist-wieder-da.html) and [oe24.at](http://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/chronik/wien/So-spaehen-uns-die-Russen-aus/159373534), when their article or analysis is about Austria or any other country. We have no way of verifying the credibility.
For example,
[“Austria: Russia’s Trojan Horse?”](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_austria_russias_trojan_horse). The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) also publishes in-depth research that is very well-sourced, for example: [“To end a war: Europe’s role in bringing peace to Syria](http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/to_end_a_war_europes_role_in_bringing_peace_to_syria7223).” When it comes to US politics, their word choices are anti-Trump, such as: [“The transatlantic meaning of Donald Trump: a US-EU Power Audit”](http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_transatlantic_meaning_of_donald_trump_a_us_eu_power_audit7229) and [“Germany, not China, will be Donald Trump’s enemy number one.”](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_germany_not_china_will_be_donald_trumps_enemy_7282)
