History
ANX Media, formerly American News X is a website that features news, op-eds and satire. All of which are categorized and labeled as such. According to their
[about page](http://anx.media/about-anx-media/) “ANX Media is about telling truth to power with a little bit of snark.” They list their publisher as, Thomas Clay. The website also discloses “Thomas Clay Jr. is also known as Lord Voldemort, Dr. Evil, and NostraThomas, the predictor of all things U.S. politics. We also feel obligated to warn you that many of his posts are actually written by his cats.” In other words be prepared for some tongue in cheek.
ANX Media also features a
[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/anxfreedom/) with over 500,000 followers that publishes consistent left leaning news and memes. [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, ANX publishes news that always favors the left and with loaded emotional wording such as this:
[The Cancer On This Presidency Is Terminal](http://anx.media/politics/the-cancer-on-this-presidency-is-terminal/). This story is appropriately sourced to [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) and the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). Editorially, ANX is opposed to President Donald Trump such as this [Trump loses it in unhinged press conference with Finnish president](http://anx.media/politics/trump-loses-it-in-unhinged-press-conference-with-finnish-president/). When it comes to sourcing information some stories contain zero hyperlinked sourcing such as this: [The Dignity of Work – A Salute to the People Who Built America](http://anx.media/politics/the-dignity-of-work-a-salute-to-the-people-who-built-america/). Editorially, ANX always favors the left and denigrates the right. In general, news is reported with factual sources, but written in a way that does not provide balance and hence results in spin that favors the left.
