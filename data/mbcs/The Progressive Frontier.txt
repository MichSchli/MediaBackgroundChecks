We may not always agree on the best way to get there, but in the end, we will work together.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The website does not specifically list who owns or edits the website, but it appears the website is co-founded by Manny Schewitz who is a progressive and registered Democrat, and Renee D. Webb who is a Recovering Conservative living at the intersection of the Bible Belt and Hypocrisy Highway. The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
The Progressive Frontier has two information categories broken up as News and Commentary. The news category tends to use minimal loaded words such as this:
[Pentagon: Transgender Troop Enlistment Delayed.](https://progressivefrontier.com/news/pentagon-transgender-enlistment-delayed/) While there is left-leaning opinion interjected into the article, it is kept at a minimum. The second category called “commentary” is quite different. There is excessive use of loaded language such as this: [Dear Trump Supporting Bigots: Fuck Your Feelings. Sincerely, The Rest of America](https://progressivefrontier.com/commentary/dear-trump-supporting-bigots-fuck-your-feelings-sincerely-the-rest-of-america/). Although the language is extremely left biased all information is properly sourced to credible media outlets. A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=progressive%20frontier&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals The Progressive Frontier has never failed a fact check. Although, we cannot find a failed fact check the site is misleading as their commentary page is empty. This makes it difficult to discern opinion pieces from actual news stories.
