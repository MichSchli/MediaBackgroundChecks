Analysis / Bias
In review, Inquisitr publishes celebrity gossip such as “
[Cardi B, Nicki Minaj Put An End To Their Bitter Feud.”](https://www.inquisitr.com/5140047/cardi-b-nicki-minaj-put-an-end-to-their-feud/) The Inquisitr also tends to republish stories by rehashing articles published by different sources, such as this [Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) article: [“Republicans Beginning To Believe Donald Trump ‘Unfit’ To Be President, Says Watergate Reporter.”](https://www.inquisitr.com/5221689/republicans-donald-trump-unfit-bernstein/) When it comes to sourcing, they typically mention the original source and provide hyperlinks to outside sources, as well as frequently sourcing to themselves.
The Inquisitr has also
[referenced](http://www.snopes.com/doctors-kill-more-people-than-guns/) sources that have a poor track record with fact-checkers, such as the right-leaning conspiracy/pseudoscience website [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). They have also been criticized for inaccuracy in reporting by [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/classes/2015/08/news_media_literacy_class_which_newspapers_magazines_and_websites_are_reliable.html) and [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/conquer-fear-flying/201508/inquisitr-faux-news-report-terrifies-anxious-flier). In general, most stories lean left in story selection and wording, though there is an [occasional article](https://images.inquisitr.com/5221895/beto-orourke-progressive-policies-sanders/) that is slightly negative toward the left.
