Analysis / Bias
In review, WXIA – 11Alive.com reports local news primarily through TV news videos and accompanying text. Local news is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[Clayton County deputy on leave after arrest video shows him ‘using physical force on a man.’](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/clayton-county-deputy-on-leave-after-arrest-video/85-ca47711d-3fbc-4f54-bf61-9caae6949204) National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other TEGNA TV stations.
WXIA also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local Georgia politics through 11alive.com. Again, the wording is low-biased such as this:
