Analysis / Bias
In review, American Renaissance Magazine publishes news that is considered racist and supports white supremacy. A frequent topic on the website is the debunked notion that there is a connection between
[race and IQ](https://www.amren.com/about/issues/#) and [Multiculturalism and the War Against White America](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/august-1994/). Articles often contain loaded emotional language that portrays African Americans negatively, such as [Race, Welfare, and Media Lies](https://www.amren.com/commentary/2019/10/race-welfare-and-media-lies/) and this [Race, Crime, and Loathing in Minnesota](https://www.amren.com/commentary/2017/08/black-crime-somalis-isis-minnesota-mark-dayton/). They also are very fearful of whites becoming the minority in the USA through their promotion of the replacement conspiracy, [The Great Replacement Is Not a Conspiracy](https://www.amren.com/commentary/2019/09/the-great-replacement-is-not-a-conspiracy/), except [it is a conspiracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/politics/grand-replacement-explainer.html).
