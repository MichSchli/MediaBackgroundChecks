Analysis / Bias
Press California is primarily a conservative news curation service that sometimes publishes original content. Articles and headlines feature loaded emotional wording that favors the right such as this
[Santa Monica wants its citizens to serve as the mask Nazis against businesses](https://presscalifornia.com/2021/11/07/santa-monica-wants-its-citizens-to-serve-as-the-mask-nazis-against-businesses/). This piece is not a news story but rather a tweet. The website curates news stories from far-right biased and questionable sources such as [The California Globe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/california-globe/), [Gateway Pundit,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) [Revolver News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/revolver-news/), [Whatfinger](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whatfinger/), [Red State](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/), [the Liberty Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-liberty-daily/), [the NOQ Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/noq-report/), and [Citizen Free Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/citizen-free-press/). All of these sources routinely fail fact checks and promote misinformation.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this
[Video: Unbelievable Stretch of Nonsensical Drunken Speech And Arm Waving From Nancy Pelosi](https://conservativeus.com/video-unbelievable-stretch-of-nonsensical-drunken-speech-and-arm-waving-from-nancy-pelosi/). Press California frequently links to sources who promote anti-vaccination propaganda, such as this [Dr. Robert Malone: ‘The Vaccinated Are Actually the Ones That Are Creating the Highest Risk for Everybody](https://noqreport.com/2021/11/06/dr-robert-malone-the-vaccinated-are-actually-the-ones-that-are-creating-the-highest-risk-for-everybody/).’ The source for this story is the discredited pseudoscience quack [Joseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) and Dr. Robert Malone, who has advocated vaccine hesitancy. In general, they are extreme right-biased and completely lack credibility based on the poor sources they curate.
