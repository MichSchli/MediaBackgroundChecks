[2 injured in shooting at Oakland barbershop](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/2-injured-in-shooting-at-oakland-barbershop/). Many stories also contain videos from the TV Station.

[Biden calls to bolster cybersecurity during meeting with tech and education leaders](https://www.kron4.com/washington-dc/biden-calls-to-bolster-cybersecurity-during-meeting-with-tech-and-education-leaders/). Political reporting is reasonably balanced, covering both sides and avoids using emotional language. In general, they report news factually and with minimal bias.
