History
The LA Times, originally called the Los Angeles Daily Times, was
[founded](https://la.curbed.com/2018/7/13/17558644/los-angeles-times-history-chandler) by Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner in 1881. The LA Times was acquired by then Editor/publisher Harrison Gray Otis. In 1885, [Harry ](https://la.curbed.com/2018/7/13/17558644/los-angeles-times-history-chandler)Chandler was hired as a circulation department clerk and became Harrison Otis’ son-in-law. Under Chandler and Otis, the paper was anti-union, which led to the [1910](https://www.kcet.org/shows/inventing-la-the-chandlers-and-their-times/timeline-history-of-the-los-angeles-times) bombing of the LA Times building, resulting in the deaths of 21 employees. In 1944, Norman Chandler succeeded his father, Harry Chandler, and in the 1960s,
Norman’s son
[Otis Chandler ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Chandler)became the owner and publisher of the LA Times. [Otis Chandler](https://www.kcet.org/shows/inventing-la-the-chandlers-and-their-times/timeline-history-of-the-los-angeles-times) “transformed the Los Angeles Times from a conservative paper into a Pulitzer Prize-winner.” Under Otis Chandler, the paper won its first of [44 Pulitzer Prizes](https://www.latimes.com/about/la-times-pulitzer-prizes-htmlstory.html).
In June 2000, Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Tribune,
[acquired](http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/13/news/mn-9216) Times Mirror Co., the parent company of the LA Times, which ended “100 years of local ownership of The Times by the Otis and Chandler families.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, the LA Times (Los Angeles Times) uses moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this
[“Outgoing White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly defends his rocky tenure”](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-john-kelly-exit-interview-20181230-story.html) and [“Engaging with the world doesn’t make Americans ‘suckers’”](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-foreign-20181230-story.html) The wording within articles also tends to lean left as evidenced by this quote from an editorial “Congress needs to focus not only on how amateurishly Trump executes foreign policy but the clear shortcomings of the policy itself.”
Regarding sourcing, the LA Times rarely uses hyperlinked sourcing, which is acceptable as news stories are covered and written by their journalists. They utilize credible sources such as the
[Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/) when using hyperlinked sources.
Editorially, the LA Times has endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidates in the
[last three elections](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/). During the 2016 General Election, the LA Times stated, “ [Hillary Clinton would make a sober, smart and pragmatic president. Donald Trump would be a catastrophe.”](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-hillary-endorsement-20160923-snap-story.html)
In a 2018
[Interview,](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/18/620925039/new-la-times-owner-says-he-wants-to-compete-for-a-national-audience) Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong told NPR, “We’ll be as competitive vis-à-vis [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).”
