History
Founded in 2015, LearnTheRisk.org is a website dedicated to exposing the pharmaceutical industry and highlighting the dangers of vaccines. According to their
[about page](https://www.learntherisk.org/about/) “Learn The Risk is a US-based, non-profit organization and a powerful force for educating people WORLDWIDE on the dangers of pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and unnecessary medical treatments — that are literally killing us.” The founder was [Brandy Vaughan](https://www.learntherisk.org/about/), who passed away in 2020 at the age of 45.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Learn The Risk breaks their information into categories. The
[Pharma](https://www.learntherisk.org/pharma/) category covers the wrongs done by big pharma, with a news feed that leads to news stories that attempt to support her claims, such as this: [BREAKING NEWS: FDA MEDICAL ADVISOR ACCUSES U.S. CONGRESS OF BEING OWNED BY PHARMA](https://www.learntherisk.org/news/congress-owned-by-pharma/). The next category is called [Vaccines](https://www.learntherisk.org/vaccines/), where this source strays very far from the consensus of science. Here are some [direct quotes](https://www.learntherisk.org/vaccines/) from their Vaccines page that have been refuted by science:
“Vaccines are not as safe and effective as they say.”
“You do NOT need an injection for protection. The BEST defense against disease is a strong immune system — NOT one overloaded with toxic additives from food, air, water, and VACCINES.”
“They contain many toxic ingredients – some KNOWN to cause cancer and brain damage – that have no place to go once injected into the body.”
“In fact, some of the most prevalent diseases in the early 1900s — including Tuberculosis (TB), Scarlet Fever, and Typhoid — followed the same declines WITHOUT ever having a vaccine program (in the US). These diseases were nearly eradicated in the U.S. without the population ever having been vaccinated for them.”
Needless to say they publish disinformation related to the Covid-19 vaccines as seen below in failed fact checks.
The website also features a news section that
[frequently reports](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) one-sided [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://www.learntherisk.org/news/sophia-died-13-hours-after-her-two-month-shots/) as well as [GMO-Vaccinations connections](https://www.learntherisk.org/news/glyphosate-in-childhood-vaccinations/), [which is not proven](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/).
