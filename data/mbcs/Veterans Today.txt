Analysis / Bias
In review, Veterans Today has been labeled an
[Antisemitic hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/01/06/buyer-beware-veterans-today-and-its-anti-israel-agenda) and [Pro-Kremlin](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/12/how-russia-targets-the-us-military-215247). Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional language such as this [Russia strongly supports cancelling US election to keep puppet Trump in office](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2020/07/30/russia-strongly-supports-cancelling-us-election-to-keep-puppet-trump-in-office/). This story is essentially unsourced, though there is one link to the Russian propaganda source [Sputnik News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/). In general, Veterans Today hold a very negative view of former President Trump, such as this [WaPo: Election Rigging Underway with Trump Abuses of Power](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2020/07/28/wapo-election-rigging-underway-with-trump-abuses-of-power/).
Veterans Today routinely publishes conspiracy theories, such as
[claiming](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/01/06/buyer-beware-veterans-today-and-its-anti-israel-agenda) 9/11 was orchestrated by Israel and claiming Julian Assange and Wikileaks are controlled by Israel. They frequently display antisemitic views, such as promoting holocaust denial, [The six-million figure: another holocaust lie and the lying liars who enable it](https://www.veteranstoday.com/2019/12/09/the-six-million-figure-another-holocaust-lie-and-the-lying-liars-who-enable-it-2/).
The
[Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) has [described](https://chicago.adl.org/anti-semitic-conspiracies-continue-aftermath-paris-attacks/) VT as a “website that presents anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.” Further, according to [The Jerusalem Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-jerusalem-post/), the website has [published](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1143932907) “articles defending Hitler, and promotes Ku Klux Klan leader [David Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duke) and the anti-semitic musician [Gilad Atzmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Atzmon).”
When not promoting hate, Veterans Today frequently publishes false and misleading information, as seen below in our failed fact checks. In general, they are a tin foil hat conspiracy website that routinely promotes antisemitic messages.
