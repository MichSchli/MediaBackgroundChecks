Analysis / Bias
According to an
[interview](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/12/13/stephen-ledrew-calls-reasons-for-his-firing-from-cp24-baloney.html) with [The Toronto Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-star/), former political commentator [Stephen LeDrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_LeDrew) claimed he was fired because of an appearance on the [Fox News Channel.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) CP24 states he was fired because of violating the non-competition clause of his contract. This may indicate a left-leaning bias by CP24; however, there isn’t clear evidence to support this.
In review, their world coverage utilizes least biased sources, such as the
[Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) CP24 demonstrates minimal bias in reporting coverage and story selection. For example, [“City councilor wants Donald Trump’s name removed from Toronto’s Trump Tower.”](https://www.cp24.com/news/city-councillor-wants-donald-trump-s-name-removed-from-toronto-s-trump-tower-1.2691534)
Editorially, they do not offer opinion pieces. Further, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 55% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/canada) and 15% do not, ranking them #8 in trust among the major English language Canadian news providers. In general, they report news factually and with minimal bias.
