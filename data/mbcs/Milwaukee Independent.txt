Analysis / Bias
The Milwaukee Independent reports original news through correspondents covering the greater Milwaukee area. Articles and headlines do not contain emotional wording such as this
[METRO MILWAUKEE AREA ALLOCATED $7M IN WORKFORCE INITIATIVE GRANTS TO HELP EMPLOY HUNDREDS OF WORKERS](http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/articles/southeastern-wisconsin-allocated-7m-workforce-initiative-grants-help-employ-hundreds-workers/). News articles do not provide hyperlinked sourcing; however, they provide quotes and attribution.
The website features opinion columns that exclusively align with the progressive left, often promoting anti-racism, equality, and workers’ rights such as this
[YOUR DISCOMFORT WITH TALKING ABOUT RACISM IS MAKING ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE](http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/reggie-jackson/discomfort-talking-racism-making-uncomfortable/). They also routinely denigrate conservatives and their policies such as this [WHEN CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS COME TO THE SOBERING REALITY THAT THEY ARE ANTITHETICAL TO JESUS](http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/john-pavlovitz/conservative-christians-come-sobering-reality-antithetical-jesus/) and this [PERPETUATING TRUMP’S BIG LIE: HOW REPUBLICANS ARE SETTING THE STAGE FOR ANTHER INSURRECTION IN 2024](http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/thom-hartmann/perpetuating-trumps-big-lie-republicans-setting-stage-anther-insurrection-2024/). The latter column comes from Progressive columnist and radio host [Thom Hartmann](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ring-of-fire/). In general, the Milwaukee Independent aligns with the progressive left through editorial positions and advocacy. News is deemed mostly factual rather than high based on consistent one-sided reporting that favors the left.
