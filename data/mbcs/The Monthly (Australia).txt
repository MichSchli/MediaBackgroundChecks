Analysis / Bias
The publisher
[Morry Schwartz](https://schwartzmedia.com.au/titles/the-monthly) describes The Monthly as “socially and politically progressive; concerned but never wet; open-minded and courageous.” [The Monthly](http://penmanshippodcast.com/episode-41-nick-feik/) typically publishes “essays from some of Australia’s best writers and critics, which regularly run in excess of 5,000 words.”
In review, The Monthly’s news articles moderately favor the left, and headlines typically utilize loaded emotional language, for instance,
[“Murdoch’s war on Labor](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2013/september/1377957600/mungo-maccallum/murdoch-s-war-labor).” Articles, in general, are critical of former Center-Right Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison, such as [“The Devil and Scott Morrison](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2019/february/1548939600/james-boyce/devil-and-scott-morrison).” Editorially, there is a strong left-leaning bias through the promotion of [environmentalism](https://www.themonthly.com.au/topic/environment), such as [“Death threat: Environmental protection laws do not conserve Australia’s wildlife – and government inaction means they never will”](https://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/mungo-maccallum/2020/27/2020/1595817844/death-threat) and equality for [LGBTQ.](https://www.themonthly.com.au/today/sean-kelly/2017/15/2017/1510723999/very-good-day)
When it comes to sourcing, The Monthly reports original news utilizing credible sources through quotes such as
[The Special Broadcasting Service (SBS)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/special-broadcasting-service-sbs/) and [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). When covering world news about the USA, they cover the former Trump Administration with a critical tone, such as this [“American carnage.”](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2020/july/1593525600/don-watson/american-carnage) In general, The Monthly reports news factually and from a liberal perspective.
