History
[Founded in 2017](https://whois.domaintools.com/uniteamericafirst.com) by Will Johnson, Unite America First is a pro-conservative and pro-Trump activist website that publishes news that denigrates liberals. According to their [about page,](https://uniteamericafirst.com/about/) Will Johnson was a “Democrat his entire life until he moved to the state of California where he saw what happens to a state under Democrat leadership. He now works to inform Americans of the evil, lawless and divisive ways of the democrat party.”
Unite America First also conducts rallies around the country.

Funded by / Ownership
Unite America First does not articulate ownership, but Will Johnson appears to be the owner. Donations, advertising, and a store that sells Pro-Trump merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Unite America First provides a link to a youtube channel and a link to news stories. News reporting is not original but instead summarized reports from other sources with strong emotional opinions added. Headlines and articles often contain heavily loaded language:
[Illegal Alien Dems Used To Attack Trump Was Actually Deported Under Clinton, Flagged Under Obama](https://uniteamericafirst.com/steven/illegal-alien-dems-used-to-attack-trump-was-actually-deported-under-clinton-flagged-under-obama/). This story is sourced to the Questionable [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/), which frequently fails fact checks.
In another story,
[Slaughter: Cops Who Shot Wisconsin Criminal “Did their job,” Had Duty To Shoot](https://uniteamericafirst.com/brittany/slaughter-cops-who-shot-wisconsin-criminal-did-their-job-had-duty-to-shoot/), they do not provide a single hyperlinked source to support their claims. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left with particular emphasis on portraying [Black Lives Matter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/black-lives-matter/) negatively [BLM Activist Fantasizes About Babies Strangling to Death While Crowd Cheers Her On](https://uniteamericafirst.com/steven/blm-activist-fantasizes-about-babies-strangling-to-death-while-crowd-cheers-her-on/).
After the 2020 Presidential Election, Unite America First promoted false information regarding election fraud and Covid-19. See failed fact checks below. In general, this is an extreme right website that is 100% one-sided, uses poor sources, and is not always factual.
