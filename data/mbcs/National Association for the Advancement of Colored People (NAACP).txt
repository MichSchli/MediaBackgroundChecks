History
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is a grassroots civil rights organization that was founded on February 12, 1909. In its early years, the
[NAACP](http://www.history.com/topics/naacp) focused on racial discrimination and violence against African Americans including the practice of lynching. At present, the [NAACP’](http://www.naacp.org/oldest-and-boldest/)s focus is “on disparities in economics, health care, education, voter empowerment, and the criminal justice system while also continuing its role as a legal advocate for civil rights issues.” The NAACP has had many historical milestones in its history, including the Anti-Lynching Bill and the Voting Rights Act.

Analysis / Bias
The NAACP is not without controversy as
[The Internal Revenue Service](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/politics/citing-july-speech-irs-decides-to-review-naacp.html) has also reviewed their tax-exempt status after Conservatives criticized the NAACP tax-exempt status and its assertion of being apolitical. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083100737.html) reported that “the IRS said the group, the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization, “continued to qualify” as tax-exempt.”
In review, the website presents news and information with minimal loaded words and they always source to credible media. The issues that the NAACP champion are those that are affiliated with the political left.
