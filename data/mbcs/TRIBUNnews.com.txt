Analysis / Bias
In review, TRIBUNnews.com publishes articles with sensational headlines such as
[“Jealous bencong angrily stabbed his/her homosexual partner.”](https://medan.tribunnews.com/2018/05/10/bencong-cemburu-mengamuk-bacoki-kekasih-homonya) The International Journalists’ Network [explains](https://ijnet.org/ru/node/5190) the wording as “Indonesians use the word ‘bencong’ or ‘banci’ to denote a man who they deem as not ‘masculine enough’” and states that these articles are framed to promote homophobia. This article was published by medan.tribunnews, which is part of the TRIBUNnews network.
National news on the other hand generally uses neutral headlines such as
[“Jokowi Assigns Airlangga Hartarto to Lead the Economic Recovery and Handling Covid-19 Team](https://www.tribunnews.com/kilas-non-kementrian/2020/07/20/jokowi-tugaskan-airlangga-hartarto-pimpin-tim-pemulihan-ekonomi-dan-penanganan-covid-19).” When it comes to sourcing they use quotes and frequently hyperlink to themselves. Finally, they cover US related news utilizing credible sources such as [CNBC.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) through quotes, however, all hyperlinks still go to other pages on their website and not to the source of quotes: [“Covid-19 Case Still High, Donald Trump Will Urge Governors to Open Schools as of September”](https://www.tribunnews.com/internasional/2020/07/08/kasus-covid-19-masih-tinggi-donald-trump-akan-desak-para-gubernur-untuk-buka-sekolah-per-september).
In general, they poorly source news and have failed a few fact checks. Further, they do not criticize the government and hold a right-leaning bias on social issues.
