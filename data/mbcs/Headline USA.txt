History
Headline USA, formerly known as
[Liberty Headlines](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/liberty-headlines/), is a conservative news and opinion website based in Charlotte, NC. According to their [about page](https://headlineusa.com/about-headline-usa/), “The radicalization of the legacy media leaves a void that others, including Headline USA (former Liberty Headlines), have stepped in to fill. With readers across the country, we combine original, enterprise reporting alongside thought-provoking analysis and articles that put breaking stories into proper context.” [Ben Sellers](https://headlineusa.com/author/bensellers/) is listed as the editor.

Analysis / Bias
Headline USA publishes summarized news stories from other sources with opinion commentary added. Articles and headlines use loaded emotional wording that favors the right such as in this article
[N.C. Supreme Court’s Democrat Majority Rejects GOP Redistricting Maps](https://headlineusa.com/n-c-supreme-courts-democrat-majority-rejects-gop-redistricting-maps/). A highly biased quote from the article reads, “When voters finally had enough of the leftist corruption, government waste and toxic social engineering and Republicans were voted back into power, they sensibly sought to change voting districts into something that more rightfully represented the majority view of the state.”
Headline USA often relies on poor sources that frequently fail checks, such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/). Editorially, all stories favor a conservative perspective and often denigrate the left, such as this [NYPD Ambush May Be Final Straw in Left’s Reckless Anti-Police Experiment.](https://headlineusa.com/nypd-ambush-final-straw-anti-police/) Finally, they promote conspiracy theories such as [election fraud](https://headlineusa.com/?s=election+fraud) against Donald Trump in the 2020 Presidential election. There has been [minimal evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) to support these claims. In general, they are far-right biased and not always factual.
Failed Fact Checks
