Analysis / Bias
In review, TheGrio covers news ranging from entertainment to lifestyle to politics. Articles and headlines utilize moderately loaded language such as this
[Underwater and on fire: US climate change magnifies extremes](https://thegrio.com/2020/09/19/climate-change-wildfires-hurricane/). Original reporting is usually properly sourced to left-leaning publications such as [The Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/). The website publishes original commentary on news stories and syndicated news from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, TheGrio presents information with a strong left-leaning bias. They frequently report negatively on the former Trump Administration, such as this
[Ex-Pence aide voting for Biden due to Trump’s ‘disregard for human life’](https://thegrio.com/2020/09/18/ex-pence-aide-voting-for-biden-due-to-trumps-disregard-for-human-life/). They also support policy that is aligned with the Democratic Party, such as concern for [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), African American and LGBTQ rights, as well as pro-labor stances. Generally, they publish news with a strong left-leaning bias that is mostly factual in reporting.
