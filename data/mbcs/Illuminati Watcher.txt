History
Founded in 2012, Illuminati Watcher (IW) is an online magazine published by Isaac Weishaupt. As the title suggests, it seeks to uncover and expose the Illuminati conspiracy that, according to Mr. Weishaupt, permeates society, emphasizing its influence in the music and entertainment industries.
According to their
[about page](https://illuminatiwatcher.com/bio/), Isaac Weishaupt has been “researching my entire life as an ongoing mission to determine if this reality is the truth or a cunning holographic deception. I don’t fully subscribe to any conspiracy theories, but I do find some intriguing if they resonate with any logic (also if they don’t, who am I kidding, some of them are just clever).” [Read our profile on USA Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the articles and YouTube videos are long on theory and conjecture, with little or no hard facts to substantiate the claims. In fairness, even Mr. Weishaupt himself states that the information provided is just theories.
“Let it be clear that these are all theories. I am merely looking at factual events and occult history and attempting to make links in the name of entertainment.”
The stories and videos, however, are heavily worded and weighted in favor of belief. Due to the bias in the reporting, and a lack of hard factual evidence to support the claims, Illuminati Watcher is rated as a Conspiracy-Pseudoscience source. (D. Kelley 3/12/2017)
