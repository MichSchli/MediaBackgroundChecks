We analyzed a piece by FactCheckNI that scrutinizes a claim titled
[“Has Northern Ireland been in fiscal deficit for most or indeed all of its existence?”](https://factcheckni.org/articles/has-northern-ireland-been-in-fiscal-deficit-for-most-or-indeed-all-of-its-existence/) made by SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole regarding Northern Ireland’s fiscal relationship with the UK Government. The analysis maintains a neutral tone and avoids biased wording. It is well-sourced, citing data from the Office for National Statistics, House of Commons debates, and academic research. The piece also provides a balanced perspective by incorporating historical context and different viewpoints.
