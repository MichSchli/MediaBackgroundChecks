Analysis / Bias
In review, most stories slightly favor the right; however, Faith Family America is careful to provide viewpoints from both sides within their articles. Story selection is almost always related to right-wing causes and is typically very well-sourced. However, many stories offer zero sourcing and render the site mixed for factual reporting based on a lack of transparency.
Editorially, more stories favor the right, but not overtly.
