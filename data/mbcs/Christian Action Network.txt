History
[Christian Action Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Action_Network) (CAS) is a Christian activist organization founded by Martin Mawyer in 1990. The organization states that its “primary goals are to protect America’s religious and moral heritage through educational efforts.” In reality, CAS’s primary goal is to attack LGBTQ, Muslims, and immigrants. According to the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), CAS is considered a [hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/one-more-enemy) for its anti-LGBTQ and anti-Muslim messages.

Analysis / Bias
The Christian Action Network produces “full-length documentary films, shorter documentaries, books, newsletters, and special reports.” The website also publishes summarized news stories that always favor a conservative perspective, such as this
[School principal who was fired after criticizing BLM will get her day in court](https://christianaction.org/top-stories-of-the-day/school-principal-who-was-fired-after-criticizing-blm-will-get-her-day-in-court/). This story is properly sourced to a local news outlet. Other articles target Critical Race Theory, and they frequently feel victimized by being white such as this [Doctor thinks I have a ‘malignant,’ ‘incurable’ condition called ‘whiteness’](https://christianaction.org/our-say/doctor-thinks-i-have-a-malignant-incurable-condition-called-whiteness/). In general, the website reads like a desperate attempt to hold on to White Christian Privilege, while using propaganda techniques and misinformation to influence readers and illicit fear. [The Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0000116/) describes them this way in their summary “Christian Action Network is an anti-Islamic organization founded by Martin Mawyer in 1990. It has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The organization states that its ‘primary goals are to protect America’s religious and moral heritage through educational efforts.”
