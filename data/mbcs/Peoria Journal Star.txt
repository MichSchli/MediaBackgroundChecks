Analysis / Bias
In review, the news is locally produced through reporters with minimal bias, such as this
[Police searching for suspect in late-night Central Peoria shooting.](https://www.pjstar.com/news/20200408/police-searching-for-suspect-in-late-night-central-peoria-shooting) National and international news is republished through the USA Today Network and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, the Journal Star is known for having a Libertarian lean. For example, in 1980, they endorsed Libertarian Presidential Candidate Ed Clark. However, most recently, they have been endorsing Democratic Presidential candidates such as
[Hillary Clinton](https://www.pjstar.com/opinion/20161015/editorial-for-us-president-trump-unfit-clinton-by-default) in 2016 and [Barack Obama](https://www.milforddailynews.com/x1720636296/Endorsement-Peoria-Journal-Star-endorses-Barack-Obama-for-President) in 2008. A review of editorials demonstrates more slightly favoring Libertarian perspectives, such as this [Editorial: Can we trust ‘Fair Tax’ if we don’t have Fair Maps?](https://www.pjstar.com/opinion/20200407/editorial-can-we-trust-fair-tax-if-we-dont-have-fair-maps) Generally, the news is reported factually with a slight right-leaning bias editorially. However, all perspectives are present and therefore earn the least biased rating.
