According to their [about page](https://trialsitenews.com/about-us/), “TrialSite’s mission is to drive awareness, introduce transparency, and facilitate engagement among people all over the world, from pharmaceutical professionals and academic researchers to regulators and healthcare professionals along with a wide array of the consuming public.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

TrialSite News claims that the owner and founder Daniel O’Connor funds the website with the aim “to create a new disruptive force in the world of biomedical research.” At this time, there does not appear to be a source of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
TrialSite News reports news and op-eds on Covid-19 treatments and vaccines. Some articles do not align with the consensus of science, such as this
[Old Lady Justice and the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://trialsitenews.com/old-lady-justice-and-the-covid-19-pandemic/). However, most articles published are both pro-science and properly sourced to research, such as this [The Cancer Research Institute Awards over $28.5 Million to Support Immunotherapy Research](https://trialsitenews.com/the-cancer-research-institute-awards-over-28-5-million-to-support-immunotherapy-research/).
While most content is credible, they have also published misinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. For example,
[they ](https://archive.is/egshP)claimed that “the ovaries get the highest concentration of [lipid nanoparticles from RNA vaccines]. This turns the ovaries into a very large manufacturing plant to turn out toxic spike protein.” Medical fact-checker [Health Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-feedback/) determined that this was [inaccurate](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-dont-affect-ovaries-or-fertility-in-general-the-vaccines-are-highly-effective-at-preventing-illness-and-death/), stating, “The biodistribution study found that the injection site retained the highest concentration of lipid nanoparticles, not the ovaries.”
Many articles use VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) as a credible source.
[According to the VEARS website](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/dataguide.html), “VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.” In other words, VAERS cannot be used as a reliable source for documenting cause and effect from the Covid-19 vaccine. Finally, one of the doctors who serves as an advisor for the website Dr. Robert Malone, claims he is the inventor of the mRNA vaccines. [This is not true.](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/3aa2eefd) Furthermore, Dr. Malone has made [misleading and false claims](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=dr.%20malone) regarding Covid-19.
In general, TrialSite News reports a combination of credible pro-science information and pseudoscience when reporting on Covid-19 vaccines. Essentially, they are promoting
[anti-vaccine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) propaganda.
