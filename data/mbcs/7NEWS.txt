Analysis / Bias
In review, 7NEWS republishes news from credible news wires such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and AAP and original content written by Seven West Media journalists. 7NEWS has conservative leanings and has been criticized for airing fake news such as these: [False pro-choice chant claim](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/16/nsw-abortion-bill-sunrise-and-seven-news-air-false-pro-choice-chant-claim) [“Sunrise segment on Indigenous adoption lands Seven in more hot water.”](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jun/14/sunrise-segment-on-indigenous-adoption-lands-seven-in-more-hot-water) [“Channel Seven under fire over interview with far-right extremist”](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/15/channel-seven-under-fire-interview-far-right-activist-blair-cottrell)
7NEWS also publishes sensational tabloid-style news such as these:
[“Dead man has the last laugh as he leaves hilarious recorded message for mourners at his funeral”](https://7news.com.au/entertainment/viral-weird/dead-man-has-the-last-laugh-as-he-leaves-hilarious-recorded-message-for-mourners-at-his-funeral-c-502920)
- “
[Second person charged with torture over alleged kangaroo killings in Tura Beach](https://7news.com.au/news/animals/second-person-charged-with-torture-over-alleged-kangaroo-killings-in-tura-beach-c-497174) [Public servant sacked after being caught urinating in office kettle](https://7news.com.au/news/sa/bureaucrat-fired-after-urinating-in-kettle-c-494487).”
Editorially, 7NEWS is reasonably balanced when it comes to USA politics, such as this:
[Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukraine confirms need for impeachment inquiry: Nancy Pelosi](https://7news.com.au/politics/donald-trump/trump-asked-zelenskiy-to-look-into-biden-c-472450). When it comes to national politics, 7NEWS tends to favor former Center-Right Prime Minister Scott Morrison: [Morrison government reveals tough new plan to stop bosses stealing wages from employees](https://7news.com.au/politics/federal-politics/wage-stealing-bosses-to-face-criminal-laws-c-461231).
