Analysis / Bias
Nova24TV promotes conspiracy theories, such as in the article
[“This Is Not A Conspiracy Theory! The List Of Soros’s “Reliable Allies In The European Parliament” Was Published By Soros’s Organisation Itself!”](https://nova24tv.eu/featured/this-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory-the-list-of-soross-reliable-allies-in-the-european-parliament-was-published-by-soross-organisation-itself/) It promotes the “Soros conspiracy” by implying that there is a coordinated effort by Soros to influence European politics through his allies in the European Parliament. While the article claims that this is not a conspiracy theory, it still suggests that there is a secretive and nefarious agenda behind Soros’ actions, which is a hallmark of Soros-themed conspiracy theories.
In another article,”
[What The American Left Has Been Doing To Trump In Recent Years, The Slovenian Left Has Been Doing To Janša For More Than Three Decades,”](https://nova24tv.eu/featured/what-the-american-left-has-been-doing-to-trump-in-recent-years-the-slovenian-left-has-been-doing-to-jansa-for-more-than-three-decades/) Nova24 (English edition) implies a similarity between tactics used by the Slovenian Left against Jansa’s government, and those used by the American left against Trump. The article portrays the Slovenian left negatively and displays bias in favor of Jansa’s government.
The NovaTV headline “
[First US State To Take Action Against Dubious Land Purchases By Bill Gates”](https://nova24tv.eu/world/first-us-state-to-take-action-against-dubious-land-purchases-by-bill-gates/) use of the term “dubious,” which suggests wrongdoing on Gates’ part but lacks specific evidence. They suggest that Gates’ land purchases in Louisiana may be related to his involvement in companies that produce synthetic food and insects. However, the connection is unclear, and no evidence is provided. In general, Nova24TV holds far-right editorial biases and occasionally publishes unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.
