History
According to the MagaPill
[about page](http://www.magapill.com/about.htm): “MAGAPILL is here to ensure that President Trump’s Legacy is properly documented. It’s been recently reported that 95% of the News Media’s coverage of Trump is negative, while only 5% is positive. This is the definition of an unfair bias and one of the main reasons why everyday American’s confidence in the “Main Stream” media is at an all-time low.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the MagaPill website consists of links to archived news stories that highlight Donald Trump’s accomplishments as President. Mostly, they link to mainstream news sources; however, they also often link to the Alt-Right website
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), which has a [poor track record](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/breitbart/) with fact-checkers. MagaPill has also been highlighted as a [fake news conspiracy website](http://www.weeklystandard.com/trump-tweets-link-to-conspiracy-theory-website/article/2010606) by the credible conservative [Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/). MagaPill frequently uses its Twitter account to promote [conspiracy theories](https://twitter.com/MAGAPILL/status/929385387017101313) such as the Seth Rich Murder.
