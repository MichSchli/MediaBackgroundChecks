Analysis / Bias
In review, The Herald-Sun publishes news with story selection that moderately favors the right. There is the moderate use of loaded language such as this
[Disgraced lawyer cops hefty jail term for stealing $1.7m](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/inner-east/disgraced-northcote-lawyer-john-kotsifas-steals-17m-to-fund-lavish-lifestyle/news-story/578c1d286d471ac6f6dd59c9a855eb14). The national news is republished through [Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/) and international news through news.com.au.
