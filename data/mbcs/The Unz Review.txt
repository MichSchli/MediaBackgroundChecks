History
Launched in 2013,
[The Unz Review](http://www.unz.com/masthead/#mission-statement) is a political analysis website that defines itself as an ‘alternative’ to the ‘mainstream media.’ According to [Ron Unz](http://www.unz.com/masthead/#mission-statement), who is the Editor-in-Chief and the owner of the site, their mission is: “I would always prefer reading something disturbing than something dull.”
The Unz Review has a long list of columnists and bloggers; although we couldn’t go through the lists, some known names are Pat Buchanan, Steve Sailer, Ilana Mercer, and Ron Paul. Steve Sailer has been criticized as both a
[racist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Steve_Sailer) and an Islamophobe. He is also listed as a promoter of hate by utilizing [primitive stereotypes](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2008/07/25/extremist-steve-sailer-source-cnns-black-america-series) to describe people of color. Ilana Mercer is also listed as a [promoter of hate](https://www.splcenter.org/file/15419) toward Muslims, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Further, Ron Unz has [donated money](https://www.adl.org/news/article/ron-unz-controversial-writer-and-funder-of-anti-israel-activists) to known hate groups and anti-Semite organizations.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Unz Review publishes articles with loaded words such as
[“Trump’s Strategy Working—He’s Maneuvered Democrats, RINOS, Into Favoring Foreigners Over Americans](http://www.unz.com/jderbyshire/trumps-strategy-working-hes-maneuvered-democrats-rinos-into-favoring-foreigners-over-americans/).“ In this particular article, they utilize questionable sources such as [vdare.com,](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vdare/) which is classified as an [extremist White Nationalist group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/vdare). They also use a different approach in which they utilize minimally loaded emotional language in their headlines, such as [“’Shithole Countries’: What Makes a Country? the Place or the People?”](http://www.unz.com/imercer/shithole-countries-what-makes-a-country-the-place-or-the-people/) However, in the body of the article, one can find plenty of racism and hate under the disguise of a philosophical discussion. Further, they also utilize factually mixed sources such as [Mises Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/) and [Consortium News](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/consortium-news/) and credible sources like [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/); however, they use them only to illustrate their far-right views via questionable sources.
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have advanced conspiracy theories such as this
[Is the Covid “vaccine” a Bioweapon?](https://web.archive.org/web/20211016084634/https://www.unz.com/proberts/is-the-covid-vaccine-a-bioweapon/) There is [no evidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20are%20effective%20at%20preventing%20infection%2C%20serious%20illness,is%20called%20a%20breakthrough%20infection.) to support that the vaccine is a bioweapons. They also claim the vaccine is an attempt to [depopulate the earth](https://www.unz.com/article/depopulation-for-dummies/).
