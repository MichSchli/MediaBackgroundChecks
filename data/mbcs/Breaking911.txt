Analysis / Bias
In review, Breaking911 republishes news from NBC:
[Trump Bodyguard: Trump Was Offered 5 Russian Women, Turned Offer Down](http://breaking911.com/breaking-trump-bodyguard-trump-offered-russian-women-turned-offer/) or CNN “ [Secret Service Agent Working Trump Motorcade Run Down By Vehicle, Driver Arrested](http://breaking911.com/breaking-secret-service-agent-working-trump-motorcade-run-vehicle-driver-arrested/).” At the same time, they capitalize on clickbait-type headlines such as “ [NSFW: Leaked video of Cardi B exposing her bare boobs surfaces](http://breaking911.com/nsfw-leaked-video-cardi-b-exposing-bare-boobs-surfaces/) and crime stories from local media [“Husband Kills Wife Less Than 15 Minutes Into New Year, Police Say.”](http://breaking911.com/husband-kills-wife-first-2018-murder-columbus-ohio/) Further, Breaking911 does not appear to have a political bias but instead publishes sensationalized stories regardless of political affiliation.
In reviewing factual reporting for Breaking911, we found a
[false claim](http://breaking911.com/isis-tweeted-this-out-15-minutes-before-chattanooga-shooting/) via [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/21/pamela-geller/pam-geller-spreads-false-claim-about-isis-linked-t/). In this breaking news story, they published an ISIS member tweeting about the Chattanooga mass shooting 15 minutes before it happened. The source of this was the highly questionable [Pam Geller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geller-report/), who has a poor track record with fact-checkers. Other poor media outlets also reported this, but this was refuted as false within a few hours. Breaking911 did not delete or amend its story to indicate it was false.
