Analysis / Bias
Amerika.org is associated with far-right and white nationalist ideology. According to a
[Daily Dot](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-dot/) interview, the editor [Brett Stevens](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/iron-march-data-amerika-ult-right-brett-stevens/) has expressed controversial views, including support for Anders Breivik and promoting repatriation. According to the article, he confirmed that he is recruiting members from the now-defunct neo-Nazi forum Iron March “I can confirm that we are soliciting members from the Iron March forum, and that we are more extreme than the Iron March,” Steven said. The article cites a leaked Iron March user database, including information about Stevens. He has expressed belief in “racial separation” and sees “diversity as a problem,” adding context to the website’s far-right ideology.
Editorially, Amerika.org favor the far-right, often criticizing the left such as this
[“Making Ourselves, Useful Idiots.”](https://www.amerika.org/politics/making-ourselves-useful-idiots/) A quote reads, “No one on the Right really wants to face this, but people vote conservative because we make the trains run on time. The Left cannot do this; they have always been the party of emotions and party favors from the warlords in Congress.” The quote uses biased language by portraying one political party as efficient and capable while dismissing the other as emotional and dependent on special interests. This creates a skewed and oversimplified view of the political landscape, which may not be accurate or fair.
Another example of biased in wording is
[Why Are Big Corporations Supporting Leftism?](https://www.amerika.org/politics/why-are-big-corporations-supporting-leftism/) Per the quote, “diversity/anti-White causes,” “White Replacement” has negative connotations. It implies a [conspiracy](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2022/05/17/racist-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-explained) to replace white people, which some readers may see as a biased oversimplification or a false belief. When sourcing information, Amerika.org utilizes sources such as [Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/), [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), [HuffPost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), and imf.org.
In general, Amerika.org promotes far-right propaganda that is sometimes conspiratorial and lacks evidence.
