History
Founded in January 2020, Knewz is a news aggregator/curator owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. According to their
[about page](https://knewz.com/about/), “We honor original reporting, favoring genuine scoops over crass clickbait. Most importantly, we provide a range of perspectives in the stories we showcase, from large and small publications, liberal and conservative, niche and general, located in all 50 states.” They further state, “Knewz.com works by combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with experienced editors. The technology scans hundreds of news sources, and our editors highlight a selection of headlines that provide a broad perspective on stories of the day.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Knewz utilizes a combination of human curation and artificial intelligence to present news from
[400 different sources](https://digiday.com/media/six-months-in-news-corps-knewz-aggregator-has-big-ambitions/). The sources used vary, ranging from right to left and between. Aggregated news stories are broken down by topic, and the reader is presented with multiple sources covering the same stories. For example, under the heading “California Lockdowns,” they present news articles from many different media outlets such as local media, [The San Diego Union-Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-diego-union-tribune/), and [Los Angeles Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) as well national outlets such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). However, under this heading, they also link to [OANN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/), a questionable source that frequently fails fact checks and holds a far-right bias [Riverside County sheriff refuses to implement Calif. Gov. Newsom’s lockdown orders](https://www.oann.com/riverside-county-sheriff-refuses-to-implement-calif-gov-newsoms-lockdown-orders/?utm_source=knewz). In reviewing numerous topic headings, we found that Murdoch-owned sources tended to be placed at the top more often, particularly Fox News.
Knewz also publishes its own news articles in mostly a summary format, citing other sources. We found that many of these stories favor the right such as this
[AOC slammed for selling $58 ‘Tax the Rich’ sweatshirts… which is why we’re giving them away for free (sort of)](https://knewz.com/aoc-pricey-campaign-merch/). The primary source used for this story is the right biased and factually mixed [Washington Free Beacon](https://knewz.com/aoc-pricey-campaign-merch/). However, it is important to mention that they also provide links to other sources that covered the same story, such as [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) and the Questionable [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/). Finally, the website also features a poll that is written in a biased way Do you think media bias against Trump could affect the election? This poll indicates a strongly right-leaning readership, with 87% responding “yes.” In general, Knewz provides a reasonable balance in source selection; however, right-leaning sources are used more often and hold higher positions. Editorially, they moderately favor the right and Murdoch-owned news sources.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years; however, some of the sources used have poor track records with fact-checkers. Although these sources have failed fact checks, Knewz only publishes articles that have other varied sources backing the story; therefore, we could not find any false claims.
