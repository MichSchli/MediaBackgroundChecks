Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered via journalists and national/international news by the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). There is minimal use of loaded language such as this: [Changes may be ahead for criticized Georgia election system](https://www.savannahnow.com/news/20190101/changes-may-be-ahead-for-criticized-georgia-election-system). Story information is always properly sourced to either hyperlinks or quotes from prominent figures.
Editorially, the Savannah Morning News was one of very few papers to
[endorse President Trump](https://www.savannahnow.com/opinion-editorial/2016-11-06/editorial-shake-it-washington-support-donald-trump). Further, many of the editorials and published opinion pieces moderately lean right.
