Analysis / Bias
In review, Private Eye is a unique publication as they publish both satire and investigative journalism, as well as
[political cartoons](https://www.private-eye.co.uk/cartoons). Many articles ridicule powerful individuals such as this [Ian Hislop says he hopes Boris Johnson goes to prison ‘forever’ in viral rant](https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/daily/2019/06/14/news/ian-hislop-says-he-hopes-boris-johnson-goes-to-prison-forever-in-viral-rant-1642340/). Other stories are political in nature such as this [Doctoring the WHO](https://www.private-eye.co.uk/news). The viewpoints tend to be left-leaning such as this [Address to the Nation from the People’s War Room](https://www.private-eye.co.uk/pms-questions).
Although Private Eye does not spare anyone when it comes to satire, they do have a questionable record with science. For example, they have sided with
[Anti-Vaccine proponent Andrew Wakefield](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Private_Eye) in the past. In general, Private Eye is a left-leaning source of information that also publishes satire, which can be confusing as there is a mix of real and satirical content throughout the website.
