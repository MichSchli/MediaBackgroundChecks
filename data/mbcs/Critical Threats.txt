Analysis / Bias
The Critical Threats Project provides in-depth analysis and policy recommendations. For example, an article titled
[“Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, September 3, 2023”](https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-3-2023) analyzes the ongoing military activities between Russia and [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/). It aims to assess the current state of the Russian offensive campaign, focusing on territorial gains and losses, military strategies, and the geopolitical implications of the conflict. The article cites ArcGIS StoryMap to represent the areas of control and conflict zones visually. However, the accuracy of this map is unclear due to a lack of details on its data sources and methodology. The article also cites Understanding War (ISW) as a source whose [board](https://www.understandingwar.org/who-we-are) includes known hawks like Dr. William Kristol, Joseph I. Lieberman, and General David Petraeus, suggesting a hawkish stance on foreign policy. Although ISW claims to be non-partisan, its board composition indicates a leaning toward assertive U.S. military action.
At the bottom of the article, the Critical Threats Project lists various sources, including factually mixed outlets like
[The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), Telegram channels, and other social media posts. The credibility of Telegram channels and social media posts may vary, so they should be cross-referenced with other reliable sources for verification.
Another article titled
[“Iran Update, August 24, 2023”](https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/iran-update-august-24-2023) provides an update on Iran’s political, military, and economic activities. It cites sources such as Facebook and Twitter posts, among others. In general, the Critical Threats Project offers comprehensive analysis and policy recommendations on various security and geopolitical issues with a right-leaning bias. However, its sourcing practices could raise questions about its factuality.
