History
[Founded in 2006](http://whois.domaintools.com/conservapedia.com), Conservapedia is an English-language wiki encyclopedia project written from an American conservative, Young Earth creationist, and Christian fundamentalist point of view. The general gist of the Wiki is that anything wrong that has ever happened occurred because of liberalism.

Analysis / Bias
In review, it is difficult to decide where to begin. First, this wiki was created to combat the so-called liberal bias of
[Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), which from what we can see, is not overly biased. Therefore, this is a right-biased Wiki to counter a generally low-biased Wiki. It isn’t apparent. The sole purpose of Conservapedia is to refute so-called liberal bias. Wiki pages on Conservapedia often lead to very poor sources, such as the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) and [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), which have all failed numerous fact checks.
They are also borderline on hate group status, consistent negative reporting on LGBTQ,
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), Racism, Border Security and people of color, Atheism, and Liberals. You really cannot find a more negative site regarding progress than this. Even today, Conservapedia still has [false information](https://www.conservapedia.com/Obama_birth_certificate_controversy) regarding former President Obama’s birth certificate. In general, Conservapedia is a highly unreliable source of information; while Wikipedia has some issues, nothing compares to this wiki’s bias and outright misleading nature.
