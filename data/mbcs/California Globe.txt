Analysis / Bias
In review, the California Globe covers government and politics throughout the state of California. News is broken into 5 categories: Governor, Legislature, Local, National, and Hollywood. The local link further breaks the news down by individual counties in California. News headlines typically are not sensational and use minimally loaded language such as this:
[Comparing California Government To Those Of Other States](https://californiaglobe.com/legislature/comparing-california-government-to-those-of-other-states/). However, there are occasional articles with moderately loaded language, such as [Dam Sexism And Racism](https://californiaglobe.com/local/dam-sexism-and-racism/). News stories are properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Sacramento Bee](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sacramento-bee/) and the [San Jose Mercury News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-jose-mercury-news/). Story selection tends to favor the right by featuring right-leaning writers such as Republican [Senator John Moorlach](https://californiaglobe.com/author/senator-john-moorlach/) and [Evan Gahr](https://californiaglobe.com/author/evan-gahr/), a columnist for the right-leaning [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and press critic for [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/).
In general, the California Globe demonstrates a right-leaning editorial bias and does not always source information properly. For example, on 7/28/2020, they
