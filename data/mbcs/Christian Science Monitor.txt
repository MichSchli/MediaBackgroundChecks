History
The
[Christian Science Monitor (CSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Science_Monitor) is an international news organization that delivers global coverage via its website, weekly magazine, daily news briefing, email newsletters, Amazon Kindle subscription, and mobile site. It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ Scientist.
According to their
[about page](https://www.csmonitor.com/About), “The Christian Science Monitor is an independent international news organization. We want to help you see news events as starting points for constructive conversations. We seek to cut through the froth of the political spin cycle to underlying truths and values. We want to be so focused on progress that together we can provide a credible and constructive counter-narrative to the hopelessness-, anger-, and fear-inducing brand of discourse that is so pervasive in the news.”
The Christian Science Monitor has
[won seven Pulitzer Prizes](https://www.csmonitor.com/About) and over a dozen Overseas Press Club awards. Although the name contains the words Christian Science, the news reporting is generally not religious, and those that are religious are clearly labeled.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The CSM reports news with minimally loaded wording and headlines such as this:
[US, China envoys, seek compromise ahead of Trump tariff decision](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/0213/US-China-envoys-seek-compromise-ahead-of-Trump-tariff-decision). All information is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, the Christian Science Monitor does not endorse political candidates. The CSM describes why they do not endorse candidates by stating, “The Monitor’s editors believe readers should decide for themselves who is best qualified for public office. Through our extensive political coverage from Capitol Hill and in races around the country, we strive to provide all the information necessary for voters to make political decisions most appropriate for them, their communities, and the nation.”
In general, the CSM provides low-biased and always well-sourced credible information.
