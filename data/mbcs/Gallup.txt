Analysis / Bias
In review, Gallup presents news based on analysis from polling data. Besides polling data, Gallup publishes news that is low biased and does not use loaded terms such as this:
[U.S. Church Membership Down Sharply in Past Two Decades](https://news.gallup.com/poll/248837/church-membership-down-sharply-past-two-decades.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=NEWSFEED&g_campaign=item_&g_content=U.S.%2520Church%2520Membership%2520Down%2520Sharply%2520in%2520Past%2520Two%2520Decades). This is sourced back to a Gallup poll that provides a methodology. [FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/), an expert on measuring and rating pollster performance, has evaluated 84 polls by Gallup, indicating they are accurate 69% of the time or Mostly Factual. They also conclude that their polling favors the Right with a score of +0.6, which [equates](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/) to Least Biased in polling. In general, Gallup is a reasonably accurate pollster that very slightly favors the Right (Republican Candidates).
