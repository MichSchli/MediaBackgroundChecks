[Everything You Need to Do in Atlanta This Weekend](https://www.thrillist.com/events/atlanta/things-to-do-in-atlanta-this-weekend). This article provides information and links regarding events occurring within Atlanta. Under the Food and Drink tab, you will find articles reviewing different foods, products, and restaurants.
Editorially, the Thrillist does not typically report on politics; however, they occasionally mock former President Trump like this:
[The President’s ‘Hamberders’ Boast Has Become a Hilarious Meme](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/hamberder-meme-president-trump). Furthermore, they frequently report on LGBTQ events and provide options for entertainment and safety, such as this: [The Most LGBTQ-Friendly City in Every Red State in America](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/most-gay-friendly-city-in-every-red-state-in-america). In general, the Thrillist reports on entertainment with minimal bias. Politically they lean left and source their information properly.
