Analysis / Bias
UrduPoint publishes articles with emotionally loaded language, such as
[“Today’s Challenges Have Roots In Failed Policies Of Imran Khan: PM.”](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/todays-challenges-have-roots-in-failed-pol-1665935.html) PTI leader [Imran Khan](https://www.redpepper.org.uk/imran-khan-anti-imperialist-hero-or-authoritarian-populist/) is known as a right-wing populist, while Shehbaz Sharif (brother of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif), current center-right PM, leads PML-N. The article mentions, “Earlier, a larger number of PTI workers and supporters took part in the party’s power show at Minar-e-Pakistan despite blockage of roads in the city.” This emphasis on PTI supporters’ dedication suggests a subtle pro-Imran Khan bias. However, UrduPoint references the social media posts of both leaders, presenting their statements directly and quoting them verbatim.
Another article titled
[“Imran Khan Asks Nation To Continue Struggle, Efforts To Uproot Corruption, Restore Rule Of Law,”](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/imran-khan-asks-nation-to-continue-struggle-e-1658957.html) uses large quotes from Imran Khan and sources from his social media account. The article reports the content of Imran Khan’s speech but does not present contrasting opinions or statements from opposition parties, which could lead to a perception of slight bias towards Imran Khan and the PTI party.
When it comes to sourcing, they either use social media sources or quotes, and for world news, they often use Russian propaganda outlet,
[Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/), such as [here](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/polands-2023-parliamentary-elections-set-to-1654493.html) and [here](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/us-rep-congressman-santos-may-seek-reelectio-1659531.html). In general, Urdupoint holds a moderate right-leaning editorial bias and is not always factual, as evidenced by failed fact checks and the use of low-credibility sources.
