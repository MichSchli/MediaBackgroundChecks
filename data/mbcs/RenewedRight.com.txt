History
According to their
[about page:](https://renewedright.com/about/) “Renewed Right was established by principled conservative veterans with over four decades of combined experience working on Capitol Hill and campaigns for the U.S. House, Senate and even President of the United States for this one simple purpose: To expose the real stories the media wants to be swept under the rug and ask your opinion on the critical issues facing our nation.” The website was launched in [2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/renewedright.com).

Analysis / Bias
Renewed Right is a blog that publishes news with a borderline extreme right bias. All stories favor the right or are opposed to the left. There is the strong use of loaded words in headlines such as: “
[This Democrat just resigned because of a shocking sex scandal](https://renewedright.com/democrat-just-resigned-shocking-sex-scandal/).” This story is not shocking and comes from the mixed factual source [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). Renewed Right also uses the factually inaccurate [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) as a primary source for their re-written articles. Other stories such as this [A secret everyone thought Jeffrey Epstein took to the grave is about to be exposed](https://renewedright.com/a-secret-everyone-thought-jeffrey-epstein-took-to-the-grave-is-about-to-be-exposed/) do not provide any sourcing.
During the 2020 election, Renewed Right frequently promoted election fraud conspiracies such as this
[A shocking video proving major voter fraud just came out of Detroit](https://renewedright.com/a-shocking-video-proving-major-voter-fraud-just-came-out-of-detroit/). This claim has been [rated false](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/04/tweets/no-biden-did-not-receive-thousands-mysteriously-su/). In general, all stories favor the right and are not always factual.
