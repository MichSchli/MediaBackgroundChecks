Analysis / Bias
In review, NewsAmmo does not provide any original content and serves as a Conservative news aggregator. The sources they aggregate from is a who’s who list of right-wing, questionable, and conspiracy websites. Here is a list of some of the Questionable sources they utilize:
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/). From the conspiracy group, we have [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). Many of the media sources NewsAmmo aggregates from have very poor track records with fact-checkers.
