Analysis / Bias
The Debrief focuses on reporting on various topics, including science, technology, and intelligence. Many stories focus on extraterrestrials such as this
[ARE SQUIDS AND OCTOPUSES ACTUALLY SPACE ALIENS?](https://thedebrief.org/are-squids-and-octopuses-actually-space-aliens/) This story relies on a credible study from [Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798). Another article titled [THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND MIT SUCCESSFULLY FLY AIRCRAFT USING “JAM-PROOF” AI-ENHANCED MAGNETIC NAVIGATION](https://thedebrief.org/the-u-s-air-force-and-mit-successfully-fly-aircraft-using-jam-proof-ai-enhanced-magnetic-navigation/), covers technology relying on credible sourcing.
In the article “
[Intelligence Officials Say U.S. Has Retrieved ‘Non-Human Craft](https://thedebrief.org/intelligence-officials-say-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft/),” thedebrief.org reports on intelligence officials’ claims regarding retrieving unidentified aerial objects (UFOs). The article presents the statements made by these officials and explores the implications and potential significance of such claims. The information is presented based on the statements made by the officials making a first-hand account. However, the article did not provide direct evidence or links to support these claims, which raises questions about the credibility of the information.
Politically, The Debrief reports on political issues as it relates to their fields of interest, such as this
[$858 BILLION DEFENSE BILL SIGNED INTO LAW BY BIDEN INCLUDES “UNPRECEDENTED” LEGISLATION ON “UNIDENTIFIED ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA.”](https://thedebrief.org/858-billion-defense-bill-signed-into-law-by-biden-includes-unprecedented-legislation-on-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena/) This story, like all others related to politics, does not interject biased opinions.
While The Debrief is usually factual and sources information properly, they sometimes rely on testimony from sources who do not present evidence. This does not mean the information is false, but we can’t say it is true without evidence. In general, The Debrief is minimally biased and mostly factual due to not always being able to back up claims with evidence.
