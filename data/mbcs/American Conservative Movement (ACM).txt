History
The domain for American Conservative Movement (ACM) was
[registered in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/americanconservativemovement.com), and they publish news and commentary for a conservative audience. The website is not clear on ownership but seems to be founded by JD Rucker of the Far-Right and Questionable [NOQ report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/noq-report/), [Jeff Dornik](https://twitter.com/JeffTheGK), Pastors [Ken Peters](https://twitter.com/PastorKenTCAPP), and [Sam Jones](https://twitter.com/samjone217). According to their [about page](https://americanconservativemovement.com/about-the-american-conservative-movement/), “the need for a conservative revival in American politics at all levels of government had never been greater. Our current leaders, even in the Republican Party, are mixed at best. President Trump has done a great job at advancing America’s agenda, but finding more than a dozen true conservatives in the House of Representatives is difficult, and in the Senate, we’d be hard-pressed to find five.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The American Conservative Movement lacks transparency as they do not make it clear who owns the website. Advertising appears to be the sole source of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The American Conservative Movement does not publish original news reporting. Rather, news and commentary are reported using outside sources. Most articles are republished from other sources. Many of these sources have low credibility and frequently promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. Sources include
[Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), [NOQ Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/noq-report/), [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/), [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), and [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/). Articles are written by staff members JD Rucker and Jeff Dornik often contains emotional wording such as this [WA Dept of Health allows vaccine centers to deny White people](https://americanconservativemovement.com/2021/04/22/wa-dept-of-health-allows-vaccine-centers-to-deny-white-people/). They utilize the Questionable [PJ Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pj-media/) as a source.
Editorially, the American Conservative Movement purports to advocate for conservative values; however, a review of the content reveals they mostly promote conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and misinformation. For example, they frequently promote anti-vaccination propaganda such as this
[Dr. Lee Merritt: If you’re younger than 39 and get vaccinated, you are 260 times more likely to die from COVID-19](https://americanconservativemovement.com/2021/04/22/dr-lee-merritt-if-youre-younger-than-39-and-get-vaccinated-you-are-260-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19/). While Dr. Merritt may be a fine Orthopedic surgeon, she has zero credibility regarding vaccinations. Dr. Merritt is a part of [America’s Frontline Doctors](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/americas-frontline-doctors/), which frequently publishes false information on the Coronavirus, vaccines, and [mask use](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/). Further, during and after the 2020 election, they consistently reported on [unproven election fraud](https://americanconservativemovement.com/?s=election+fraud).
In general, the American Conservative Movement promotes a far-right perspective and frequently publishes false information rendering them with low credibility.
Failed Fact Checks
