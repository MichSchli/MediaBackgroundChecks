Analysis / Bias
According to a Columbia Journalism Review
[article](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/kyiv_post_success.php) dated 2014 titled “Kyiv Post’s unlikely success,” they describe how an editor from Minnesota and a Pakistani billionaire are riding the story of their lives as Ukraine unravels.” The Kyiv Post’s main focus is on stories about corruption and war.
In review, the Kyiv Post utilizes emotionally loaded language in its headlines, such as
[“Ukraine continues to build case against Russia in International Court of Justice in The Hague.”](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/ukraine-continues-to-build-case-against-russia-in-international-court-of-justice-in-the-hague.html) Sourcing is typically through large blocks of quotes via interviews or utilizing local sources, which we have not verified, such as [Ukrayinska Pravda](https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/halya-coynash-ukrainian-neo-nazi-c14-gets-public-funding-for-patriotic-education.html), Ukrainian News Agency, The UNIAN, khpg.org (The Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KhPG), and hromadskeradio.org. In this [article](https://www.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/halya-coynash-ukrainian-neo-nazi-c14-gets-public-funding-for-patriotic-education.html), there is a good example of word choices/opinions that favor the left: “It is likely that the 30 young masked thugs who [burned down](http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1526086152) a permanent Roma settlement in Rudne, near Lviv on 9 May were also from far-right groups.” The Kyiv Post also republishes articles from various left-leaning sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Buzzfeed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/buzzfeed/), and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/).
