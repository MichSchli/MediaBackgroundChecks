Analysis / Bias
World News Daily Report publishes fake news stories or hoaxes with the hope they will be shared on social media. The website contains a broad warning at the bottom of each page that indicates the website is satirical: “World News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.”
A sample hoax article looks like this:
[CHINESE LUNAR ROVER FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF AMERICAN MOON LANDINGS](https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-of-american-moon-landings/). Surprisingly, even though listed as satire, World News Daily Report is [fact-checked frequently](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chinese-lunar-moon-landings/) due to their stories being shared on social media by the gullible. Here is another example of a typical fake news story found on World News Daily Report: [COLORADO: HUNTER CLAIMS HE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY A SASQUATCH](https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/colorado-hunter-claims-he-was-sexually-assaulted-by-a-sasquatch/)
