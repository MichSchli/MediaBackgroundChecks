Analysis / Bias
In review, the Denton Record-Chronicle covers local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Denton auditor: City credit cards need more monitoring](https://www.dentonrc.com/news/denton-auditor-city-credit-cards-need-more-monitoring/article_8ac179fb-890b-5220-9c92-888104a02532.html). The national news is mostly covered by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and also Texas media such as the [Texas Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/texas-tribune/). All stories are properly sourced.
Editorially, they cover both sides but do tend to slightly favor the left with Op-Eds such as this:
[Texas GOP leadership must root out racial bias and religious bigotry for the party to succeed](https://www.dentonrc.com/opinion/editorials/texas-gop-leadership-must-root-out-racial-bias-and-religious/article_7cc6aca0-301c-5291-807f-f5e55e463d18.html). Typically, news coverage is low-biased, and Op-Eds lean slightly left. Combined, this still qualifies as a least biased source based on straight news reporting.
