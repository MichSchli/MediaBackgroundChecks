Analysis / Bias
In review, TheWrap reports news/commentary utilizing sources like
[Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/) and [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) and factually Questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). They use sensational, emotional wording in their headlines and articles; however, they usually cover both sides, such as:” [ Ann Coulter Says She’s Out of Patience With ‘Emperor God’ Trump](https://www.thewrap.com/ann-coulter-emperor-god-trump/),” “ [Young Turks’ Founder Cenk Uygur Apologizes for ‘Ugly,’ ‘Insensitive’ Old Blog Posts (Exclusive)”](https://www.thewrap.com/young-turks-cenk-uygur-blog-breasts-women-flawed/) and “ [Trump Attacks CNN; CNN Tells Him How to Do His Job.”](https://www.thewrap.com/trump-takes-twitter-swing-at-cnn-puts-foot-in-his-mouth/)
TheWrap is difficult to classify. The individual articles on their website are biased toward both the left and right. However, there is a frequent criticism of former President Trump such as this:
[Trump Roasted for Misspelling First Lady’s Name in Tweet: ‘Who the F— Is Melanie?’](https://www.thewrap.com/trump-roasted-for-misspelling-melania-name-in-tweet-who-the-f-is-melanie/).
In general, they always source their information, but sometimes those sources are of poor quality. The bottom line is TheWrap’s sole purpose is to sell ads by getting as many page views as possible. They accomplish this by promoting sensational stories with little regard for political bias.
