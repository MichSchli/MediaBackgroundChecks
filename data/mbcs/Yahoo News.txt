History
Founded in 1996, Yahoo! News is a news website that originated as an internet-based news aggregator by the search engine Yahoo!. Articles originally came from popular news services such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), and the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/).
In 2011, Yahoo expanded its focus to include original content, and in 2012 the website had a correspondent in the White House press corps for the first time.
[As of January 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News), Yahoo! News ranked sixth among global news sites, ahead of Fox News and behind [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), according to Alexa.

Analysis / Bias
Yahoo News! is primarily a news aggregator; however, they do provide original content written by staff journalists. First, we will examine the sources used for aggregation. Yahoo News! breaks the news down to the following categories: US, World, Politics, Originals, and Health. Under US news, Yahoo News! aggregates content exclusively from Reuters. Under World News, they use a combination of Reuters, Associated Press,
[Christian Science Monitor](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-science-monitor/), and [AFP.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/)
The Politics section consists of only original content written by Yahoo Staff, as does the Originals section. Under the Health tab, there are various sources used, with none of them being High Science. Most stories are derived from Self, Shape, and Men’s Health magazines. Finally, they list all the stories from all the categories under the News Home tab. On 03/04/2023, we reviewed the first 100 stories on the homepage and calculated percentages based on the sources’ bias. The results indicate Yahoo News! selects more left-leaning sources. See the charts below.
Yahoo’s original content found on the Politics page leans left in wording and story selection, such as this:
[Trump just a blowhard on windmills, lawmakers say of ‘idiotic’ comments](https://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-from-both-parties-ridicule-trumps-idiotic-wind-power-theories-180842303.html). However, they will also publish information that is not favorable to Democrats, like this: [Seven women have now accused Joe Biden of inappropriate touching](https://news.yahoo.com/seven-women-have-now-accused-joe-biden-of-inappropriate-touching-131204785.html). After reviewing dozens of original political news stories, more favor the left than the right. Further, original content is properly sourced to credible media outlets. Finally, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) Institute survey found that 34% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 35% do not, ranking them #12 in trust of the major USA news providers.
