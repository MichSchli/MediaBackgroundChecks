Analysis / Bias
In review, WION publishes tabloid-style stories such as
[“Sports Illustrated’ swimsuit issue honours #MeToo with first-ever nude photo series”](http://www.wionews.com/world/entertainment-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-honours-metoo-with-first-ever-nude-photo-series-32218) and reports international news with minimally loaded words. They use various news agencies, some of which are not known by us, and some highly credible such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). However, they usually poorly source their articles using quotations without linking to the source, such as [“Kim Yo Jong: Meet the ‘Ivanka Trump’ of North Korea”](http://www.wionews.com/photos/kim-yo-jong-meet-the-ivanka-trump-of-north-korea-684#photo-37445) and [“FBI contradicts White House on probe of former aide Rob Porter.”](http://www.wionews.com/world/fbi-contradicts-white-house-on-probe-of-former-aide-rob-porter-32788)
Recent articles in 2020 continue to display minimal bias, such as this
[Japan expands coronavirus emergency nationwide amid spike in cases](https://www.wionews.com/world/japan-expands-coronavirus-emergency-nationwide-amid-spike-in-cases-292928); however, there is still a lack of hyperlinked sourcing, though they generally provide video as a source. However, in 2020 they promoted misinformation as it relates to Coronavirus.
Editorially, WION presents both sides; however, a review of 50+ opinion pieces reveals slightly more favor the right, with some praising
[PM Modi](https://www.wionews.com/opinions-blogs/pm-narendra-modi-led-from-the-front-in-the-fight-against-coronavirus-crisis-in-india-292865) and others promoting [nationalism](https://www.wionews.com/opinions-blogs/coronavirus-pandemic-exposes-risks-and-vulnerability-of-hyper-globalised-system-292635). Generally, news reporting is factual and low-biased, while editorials lean slightly right.
