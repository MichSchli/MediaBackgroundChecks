Analysis / Bias
In review, the Young Conservatives Facebook page serves as a vehicle to publish conservative memes and news articles from the Young Conservatives website hosted by Analyzing America. The Young Conservatives website always publishes stories that favor the right and denigrate the left. Headlines are often sensationalized and emotional such as this:
[VIDEO: Biden Slurs, Mumbles, Loses His Train of Thought, Wanders from Podium](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/2022/08/666684/). This story is sourced through video.
Editorially, they have a very favorable opinion of President Trump by frequently reporting negatively on his opposition, such as this:
[Hillary Clinton reveals if she’ll run again for White House after two failed attempts](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/2022/09/667675/). And this [BREAKING: Trump Betrayed By A Snitch In His Inner Circle, Which Led to the FBI Raid.](https://www.analyzingamerica.org/2022/08/666409/) This story relies on the credible source [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) and questionable source [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/). In general, story selection 100% favors the right and sometimes utilizes poor sources.
