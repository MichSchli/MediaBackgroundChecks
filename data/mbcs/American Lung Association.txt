History
[Founded in 1904](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Lung_Association), The American Lung Association is a voluntary health organization whose mission is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through education, advocacy, and research. The organization was originally founded to fight Tuberculosis in the early 2oth century. According to their [about page](https://www.lung.org/about-us), “With TB largely controlled in the United States, we have extended that mission to other respiratory diseases. And thanks to our donors, volunteers, program and event participants, and staff, we are America’s trusted source for lung health education, lung disease research, support, programs, services, and advocacy.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Editorially, they endorse the scientific consensus on lung health. From a biased perspective, they align left of center based on concern for climate change and its impact on health and anti-smoking campaigns. Further, throughout former President Trump’s presidency, the ALA frequently
