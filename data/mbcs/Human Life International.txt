History
[Human Life International (HLI)](https://www.hli.org/about-us/annual-report-2021/) is a Catholic, tax-exempt organization based in [Front Royal, Virginia](https://www.hli.org/about-us/offices/), founded in 1981 by [Father Paul Marx](https://www.hli.org/about-us/leadership/). Originating from the Human Life Center established in 1972, HLI is a prominent pro-life and pro-family apostolate, active in over [100 countries](https://www.hli.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HLI-2018-Impact-1.pdf), with Father Shenan J. Boquet as its president.
The organization is known for its strong opposition to same-sex marriage and its pro-life stance based on traditional Catholic beliefs, often reflected in its blog posts, which we analyzed below. HLI’s
[mission](https://www.hli.org/about-us/annual-report-2021/) includes training and organizing leaders in the anti-abortion movement, encompassing priests, crisis pregnancy centers, civic leaders, and family counselors. Their [activism](https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/07/u-s-nonprofit-funds-fight-to-imprison-women-for-abortions-in-el-salvador.html) is grounded in [Catholic anti-abortion](https://newrepublic.com/article/148518/american-christians-swaying-irelands-abortion-referendum) beliefs, advocating against contraceptives and supporting the criminalization of homosexuality in some countries.

Analysis / Bias
HLI adheres to a traditional view of marriage, exclusively between a man and a woman, and here in this article,
[“Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage: Things You Need to Know,”](https://www.hli.org/resources/supreme-court-legalizes-gay-marriage/#:~:text=The%20legalization%20of%20same,is%20a%20very%20long%20story) criticizes the U.S. Supreme Court’s legalization of same-sex marriage as overstepping constitutional limits. Their article, [“Dealing with Same-Sex Attraction through the Sacred Heart,”](https://www.hli.org/2015/06/sacred-heart-and-dealing-with-same-sex-attraction/) controversially claims that homosexual orientation may link to gender-identity disturbances and suggests that specific interventions could reduce or eliminate same-sex attraction, a view not widely supported by scientific consensus. HLI’s stance opposes same-sex marriage, labeling it contrary to Christian doctrine and traditional family values.
HLI has a history of supporting political candidates aligned with their pro-life agenda. In 2010, HLI-Philippines backed Senator
[Manny Villar](https://www.philstar.com/cebu-news/2010/03/10/556297/pro-life-group-backs-candidacy-villar) primarily due to his stance against the Reproductive Health Bill. The organization also considered other candidates, such as [Ireland’s Abortion Referendum](https://newrepublic.com/article/148518/american-christians-swaying-irelands-abortion-referendum), indicating a strategic approach to endorsing political figures who align with their pro-life values.
In the U.S., initially, HLI expressed skepticism about Donald Trump’s pro-life stance, considering his past as a “pro-choice” New York liberal. However, this perspective shifted positively during Trump’s presidency as he pursued a pro-life agenda. HLI’s articles, such as
[“Trump’s Historic Speech at the March for Life,”](https://www.hli.org/2020/01/trumps-historic-speech-at-the-march-for-life/) commend Trump’s dedication to pro-life causes and his symbolic participation in the March for Life. Despite this, recent remarks by Trump criticizing the [six-week abortion ban in Florida](https://www.hli.org/2023/09/trumps-critical-remarks-of-post-roe-legislation/) have led to HLI’s disappointment. The organization has criticized Trump for seemingly prioritizing public opinion over a consistent pro-life ethic.
In contrast to its view on Trump, HLI criticizes President Joe Biden for his evolving positions on abortion and LGBT issues, characterizing these changes as politically expedient rather than conviction-driven. The article
[“Abortion is Beyond Politics”](https://www.hli.org/2023/05/abortion-is-beyond-politics/) portrays Biden as a career politician whose stances have shifted to align with the increasingly liberal views of the Democratic Party. This criticism reflects HLI’s disapproval of Biden’s current pro-abortion and pro-LGBT stances, which are seen as contrary to traditional Catholic values.
In general, Human Life International (HLI) holds right-leaning biases, particularly on same-sex marriage and abortion, and through their support for political figures who align with these stances. They are also not always fact-based due to their positions often conflicting with scientific understanding, especially regarding human sexuality and the promotion of pseudoscience to advance its agenda (See failed fact checks).
