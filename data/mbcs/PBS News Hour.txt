History
[PBS NewsHour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS) is an American daily evening television news program broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), airing seven nights a week on more than 300 of the public broadcaster’s member stations. As the nation’s first hour-long nightly news broadcast, the program is known for its in-depth coverage of issues and current events.
Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer created PBS NewsHour.
In 2003, UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose and Missouri economist Jeff Milyo evaluated various media programs based on “think tank” citations to map liberal versus conservative media slants and published a study alleging liberal media bias in general. PBS NewsHour is the
[most centrist news program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_NewsHour) on television and the closest to a truly objective stance based on their research. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, PBS NewsHour offers high-quality, in-depth journalism with minimal bias through wording. For example, these headlines and articles contain minimal bias:
[Violence at the Venezuelan border, humanitarian aid blocked](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/violence-at-the-venezuelan-border-humanitarian-aid-blocked) [Pentagon chief getting firsthand look at US-Mexico border](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/pentagon-chief-getting-firsthand-look-at-us-mexico-border) [Shields and Brooks on Trump declaration, Bernie Sanders’ 2020 bid](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/shields-and-brooks-on-trump-declaration-bernie-sanders-2020-bid)
PBS sources all information through quotes and/or hyperlinks and provides transcripts from videos on the website. PBS NewsHour has been criticized as being
[left-biased](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pbs-liberal-political-activity-public-funding-should-end/) by the [right](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/) and in [favor of corporations](https://fair.org/topic/pbs-newshour/) by the progressive left. In general, story selection and tone slightly favor the left when it comes to [environmental issues](https://fair.org/topic/pbs-newshour/) and with moderately [negative reporting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-to-let-attorney-general-decide-what-to-release-from-mueller-report) of former President Trump. PBS NewsHour’s reporting is evidence-based and accurate.
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/pbs/) found that 60% of PBS’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 26% Mixed, and 15% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers PBS.
