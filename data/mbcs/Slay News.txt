Analysis / Bias
Slay News is a conservative news and opinion website that frequently promotes misinformation and false claims, especially as it relates to Covid-19 vaccines and WEF conspiracies (see failed fact checks).
The website does not produce original journalism but rather summarizes, adds commentary, or
[plagiarizes other’s news content](https://web.archive.org/web/20221224173049/https://slaynews.com/news/journalists-tow-camper-115k-electric-truck-regret-it/) without attribution. Further, their [editorial standards page](https://slaynews.com/editorial-standards/) is [copied directly](https://www.theblaze.com/about) from [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) website. Articles and headlines contain strongly emotional wording such as this [‘Climate Czar’ John Kerry Caught Lying about Private Jet Use during House Hearing](https://slaynews.com/news/climate-czar-john-kerry-caught-lying-private-jet-use-house-hearing/) and [Nobel Prize-Winning Scientist: ‘Climate Crisis’ Narrative Is a Hoax](https://slaynews.com/news/nobel-prize-winning-scientist-climate-crisis-narrative-hoax/).
Editorially, all stories favor the conservative right and often promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. For example, they frequently promote anti-vaccine propaganda, such as this
[‘Vaccination Expert’ Dr Alfredo Victoria Dies Suddenly at 42 after Promoting Shots on TV](https://slaynews.com/news/tv-doctor-vaccination-expert-dr-alfredo-victoria-dies-suddenly-42/). There is no evidence to indicate the MD died from the vaccine. Further, the source of this information is the anti-vaccine outlet [DiedSuddenly](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/diedsuddenly-info/). Finally, Slay News strongly supports former President Trump and repeats his stolen election claims like this [Dinesh D’Souza Challenges Bill Barr to Debate over Election Fraud Claims in ‘2000 Mules’](https://slaynews.com/news/dinesh-dsouza-challenges-bill-barr-debate-election-fraud-2000-mules/). They also consistently denigrate Democrats, such as this [Obama’s WH Doctor Warns Biden’s Mental Decline ‘Brings Us Closer’ to WW3](https://slaynews.com/news/obamas-wh-doctor-warns-bidens-mental-decline-brings-us-closer-ww3/). In general, Slay News is a far-right biased news source that routinely promotes disinformation for purposes that are unknown.
