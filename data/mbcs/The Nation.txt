History
Founded in 1865,
[The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/liberator-released/) is an American weekly business magazine based in New York City. The Nation covers world and national news, politics, economy, arts, culture, and more. The Nation considers itself a continuation of William Lloyd Garrison’s anti-slavery newspaper, [The Liberator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberator_(newspaper)).
The Nation’s founding publisher was Joseph H. Richards and the Irish-born American Journalist
[Edwin Lawrence Godkin](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-on-edwin-lawrence-godkin-the-irish-born-newspaper-editor-who-took-on-tammany-hall-1.2650972). They had formerly worked as a correspondent of the London Daily News and editor of the New York Evening Post. After the Nation was sold to the New York Evening Post, Godkin became editor of the Post, which he held until his retirement in 1899. Wendell Phillips Garrison, son of William Lloyd Garrison, was Literary Editor from 1865 to 1906. Newspaperman-turned-railroad-baron Henry Villard bought the Nation in 1881, and The Nation became a weekly supplement for the New York Evening Post (Later, it became the [New York Pos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post)t). After Henry Villard, his son, Oswald Garrison Villard, would become the new owner in 1900.

Analysis / Bias
The Nation
[endorsed](https://www.thenation.com/article/bernie-sanders-for-president/) Bernie Sanders for President in 2016. They have also been criticized for being a Pro-Russia publication by [conservatives](https://www.influencewatch.org/for-profit/nation/) and [liberals](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/07/stephen_cohen_vladimir_putin_s_apologist_the_nation_just_published_the_most.html). Here is a [quote](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/putins-patsies/) from the right-leaning Washington Free Beacon: “The Nation’s modern-day Russia coverage has been criticized as too pro-Putin. Stephen F. Cohen, the husband of editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, has been characterized as a Putin apologist.” However, an op-ed writer for The Nation was forcibly removed from a [press briefing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/16/reporter-from-the-nation-forcibly-removed-from-trump-putin-presser.html) between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin on July 16, 2018, for holding up a sign regarding a nuclear weapons ban treaty, according to [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/).
In review, The Nation reports news with emotionally loaded words and bias, such as
[“Judge Kavanaugh: An Originalist With a New—and Terrifying—Interpretation of Executive Power”](https://www.thenation.com/article/judge-kavanaugh-originalist-new-terrifying-interpretation-executive-power/) and [“It’s Time to Disrupt NATO, But not for the reasons Trump gives.”](https://www.thenation.com/article/time-disrupt-nato/)
Typically, The Nation utilizes credible sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [The Chronicle of Higher Education](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-chronicle-of-higher-education/); however, they also source through large quotes.
