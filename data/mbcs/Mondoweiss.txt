History
Mondoweiss, established in 2006 by journalist Philip Weiss and later co-edited with Adam Horowitz, operates under the Center for Economic Research and Social Change. Initially part of The New York Observer’s website, it became independent in 2007. Mondoweiss identifies itself as a news website covering American foreign policy in the Middle East, mainly from a progressive Jewish perspective. The founder, Weiss, is a self-described
[progressive and anti-Zionist](https://mondoweiss.net/2009/01/why-i-say-im-an-antizionist-not-a-postzionist/). [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Mondoweiss exhibits a strong pro-Palestinian bias and is extremely critical of the Israeli government. It frequently publishes content that is negative toward Israeli policies and actions, often portraying them in a highly critical light. For example, the article “
[Genocide in service of Nakba 2023](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/12/genocide-in-service-of-nakba-2023/)” is emotionally loaded and one-sided against the Israeli government due to its use of highly charged language and its singular focus on alleged atrocities committed by Israel without providing context or perspectives from the Israeli side. The piece characterizes the situation as a “genocidal war on Gaza” aimed at “depopulation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people” in “brutal but deliberate stages.” It accuses the Israeli government of engaging in “widespread destruction and industrial-scale slaughter,” cutting off essential supplies like water and food and targeting civilian areas for destruction. The article alleges that these actions are part of a strategy by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to achieve “complete forced displacement” of Palestinians, describing this as “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide” used as a means to an end. This piece is a one-sided opinion by the author.
In another article
[Massacre: Israel kills over 500 Palestinians in Gaza hospital attack](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/10/massacre-israel-kills-over-500-palestinians-in-gaza-hospital-attack/), they promote the unproven claim that Israel bombed the hospital. While it is not conclusive as of this date who bombed the hospital, [evidence suggests](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/gaza-findings-october-17-al-ahli-hospital-explosion) it was an errant rocket. In the article, they state: “Israel denied responsibility and claimed that the explosion was the result of an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) missile [without offering evidence](https://x.com/MirzaMahan/status/1714377238823469399?s=20). However, this is exactly what Mondoweiss did with this statement: “The Israeli military bombed the Anglican-run al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday massacring hundreds of people.” Again, there was no evidence at the time of report and today it is still inconclusive.
Further, the site’s founder’s anti-Zionist stance is reflected in the content, with articles often presenting a one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The
[ADL](https://mondoweiss.net/2020/01/adl-lies-about-me-so-as-to-shut-down-discussion-of-israels-role-in-soleimani-killing/) has categorized Mondoweiss as a hate group promoting antisemitism. The site has been accused of presenting misleading information and promoting a narrative of “ [holocaust inversion](https://web.archive.org/web/20160414205309/http://stanfordreview.org/article/stanfords-most-radical-professor-strikes-again/),” suggesting that Israelis are committing atrocities akin to the Holocaust against Palestinians. This view is nearly universally considered antisemitic as it [minimizes the atrocities](https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/356234/jewish-studies-and-holocaust-inversion-making-gaza-into-auschwitz/) committed by the Nazis.
Editorially, most articles favor a progressive left perspective such as this
[The socialist path forward](https://mondoweiss.net/2020/12/the-socialist-path-forward/) and [BDS vs. the lie of ‘woke Zionism’](https://mondoweiss.net/2021/04/bds-vs-the-lie-of-woke-zionism/). While most stories are rooted in fact, the stories often omit important context that can paint a misleading picture (propaganda) of the situation. Finally, while Mondoweiss typically sources its news stories, it sometimes relies on the low factual [Quds News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quds-news-network-bias-and-credibility/), such as in this story. [Israel praises ‘exceptionally restrained’ protests in Gaza after killing 4 Palestinians, three of them teenagers](https://mondoweiss.net/2019/03/exceptionally-restrained-palestinians/).
