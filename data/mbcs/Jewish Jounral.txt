Original news reporting typically is low biased on a left-right spectrum but often favors Israel, such as this:
[CA Dem Party Criticizes Israeli Treatment of Palestinian Children, Condems Anti-Zionism](https://jewishjournal.com/news/nation/california/303618/ca-dem-party-criticizes-israeli-treatment-of-palestinian-children-condems-anti-zionism/). Editorially, the Jewish Journal features columnists such as [David Suissa](https://jewishjournal.com/author/david-suissa/), [Karen Bloch](https://jewishjournal.com/author/karen-lehrman-bloch/), [Ben Shapiro](https://jewishjournal.com/author/benshapiro/), and [Scmuel Rosner](https://jewishjournal.com/author/shmuel-rosner/). Reviewing and researching these columnists, two lean conservative and two lean liberal. However, in general, more stories tend to favor the right slightly.
