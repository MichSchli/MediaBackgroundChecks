[Judge Approves Restraining Order Against Mel Tucker From Releasign More Private Texts](https://www.wjr.com/2023/10/11/judge-approves-restraining-order-against-mel-tucker-from-releasign-more-private-texts/).

The radio station and website broadcasts a daily lineup of news radio hosts and shows that generally hold moderate conservative perspectives.
Editorially, the majority of radio hosts hold moderate conservative viewpoints. While they do not publish op-eds, political news reporting leans right and generally low biased, such as this
