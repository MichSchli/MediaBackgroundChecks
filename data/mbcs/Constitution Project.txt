History
[Founded in 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Project), The Constitution Project (TCP) brings together policy experts and legal practitioners from across the political spectrum to foster consensus-based solutions to our time’s most difficult constitutional challenges.
According to their a
[bout page](https://constitutionproject.org/about-us/): “In December 2017, TCP officially became a project of the Project On Government Oversight–a nonpartisan, independent government watchdog that has worked for over 36 years to hold both Republican and Democratic administrations and Congress accountable to the people and our democratic ideals. Sarah Turberville is the director of The Constitution Project at POGO.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Constitution Project is a non-profit think tank funded through donations via the
[Project On Government Oversight (POGO)](https://www.pogo.org/). POGO investigates and works to expose the U.S. federal government’s waste, fraud, abuse, and conflicts of interest. [According to its website](https://www.pogo.org/), POGO works with whistleblowers and government insiders to identify wrongdoing in the federal government and works with government officials to implement policy changes based on its investigations. Executive director Danielle Brian leads POGO. [Funding](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Project_On_Government_Oversight) for POGO is mainly derived from left-leaning foundations such as Open Societies and the Ford Foundation.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features a list of issues they support that generally align with the left, such as
[opposition to the death penalty](https://constitutionproject.org/issues/criminal-justice-reform/death-penalty/), [Pro-Immigration](https://constitutionproject.org/issues/rule-of-law/immigration/), and [demilitarization of the police](https://constitutionproject.org/issues/policing-reform/). The website also features a blog that uses minimally loaded language such as this: [The President v. The Courts](https://constitutionproject.org/documents/the-president-v-the-courts/). This particular blog entry completely lacks sourcing.
Editorially, the Constitution Project does not have a favorable view of former Republican President Donald Trump:
[TCP Alarmed by Trump Administration Lifting Critical Limits on Police Militarization](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/TCP-Alarmed-by-Trump-Administration-Lifting-Critical-Limits-on-Police-Militarization.html?soid=1101561619973&aid=LOEIcanLzGQ). TCP is generally left-leaning in policy advocacy, story selection, and editorially.
