Analysis / Bias
In review, Behold Israel has a news section that reports news about Israel. The content is reasonable, but there is little use of actual sources for these articles. Behold Israel also has a blog for Amir Tsarfati that uses loaded language and promotes
[conspiracy theories](http://beholdisrael.org/news-israel/amirs-blog/word-amir-las-vegas-massacre). For example, [“The Mystery of the Rapture”](http://beholdisrael.org/news-israel/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-bible-prophecy-incredible-developments-feb-15-2017) and [“Amir’s Prophecy Update”](http://beholdisrael.org/news-israel/amirs-blog/amir%E2%80%99s-prophecy-update) which has extreme right-wing bias with this quote: “Obama just announced his intention to appoint a new Supreme Court justice instead of the conservative Scalia who passed away unexpectedly. Another liberal justice means a great moral downfall of the USA.”
In general, they are a right-leaning site that promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
