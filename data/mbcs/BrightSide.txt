History
[Founded in 2014](http://whois.domaintools.com/brightside.me), BrightSide is a website that publishes clickbait stories with the hope they will go viral on Social Media. Their about page states, “We always check to make sure our facts are straight; our sources are reliable and respectable. Everything we produce is made with attention and care. We only ever share with you the things which made us laugh, inspired us, or touched our hearts. Everything we offer you is done with sincerity – we couldn’t do it any other way.” [Read our profile on Cyprus media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cyprus-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, BrightSide publishes news and information in three categories: Inspiration, Creativity, and Wonder. The majority of the content consists of lists such as this:
[12 Things Men and Women See in Completely Different Ways](https://brightside.me/wonder-curiosities/12-things-men-and-women-see-in-completely-different-ways-795178/). Further, this story is sourced to [Pew](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/) and heavily utilizes graphics vs text. In another story, they make misleading claims, stating that fruit juice is worse for your health than cigarettes: [8 Foods That Are Worse Than Cigarettes](https://brightside.me/creativity-cooking/9-foods-that-are-worse-than-cigarettes-794179/). This article also does not align with the consensus of science when it states that [GMO soy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) is also worse than cigarettes. Further, the website promotes questionable fad diets such as this: [What the Facelift Diet Is and How It Helps You Remove Wrinkles and Lose Weight](https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/what-the-facelift-diet-is-and-how-it-helps-you-remove-wrinkles-and-lose-weight-709110/). In general, BrightSide publishes harmless articles meant to garner clicks; however, they occasionally promote pseudoscience.
