Analysis / Bias
In review, UPI is similar to
[Reuters](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [AP](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), but on a smaller scale. Articles typically use neutral language such as this [Saudi Arabia cuts oil output after Houthi drone attack](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/09/14/Saudi-Arabia-cuts-oil-output-after-Houthi-drone-attack/9121568462706/?spt=slh&or=2). This story is properly sourced back to [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). In general, story selection is neutral and low-biased. For example, when covering President Trump, they do not offer opinions but rather report the facts, [Trump, Netanyahu discuss mutual defense treaty ahead of Israel elections](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/09/14/Trump-Netanyahu-discuss-mutual-defense-treaty-ahead-of-Israel-elections/5221568496372/?upi_ss=trump). They also do not publish editorials.
