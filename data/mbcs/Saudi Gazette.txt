History
Founded in 1978, the Saudi Gazette is one of the leading English-language daily newspapers based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, published by OKAZ. The Saudi Gazette publishes news and opinions concerning national, Arab, and international issues.
According to their
[about page](http://saudigazette.com.sa/about-us), the paper’s current editor-in-chief is [Somayya Jabarti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somayya_Jabarti). She is the first woman editor-in-chief of a Saudi Arabian national newspaper. The readership is primarily drawn from foreign residents.
The sister publication of Saudi Gazette is
[OKAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaz), and according to the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/01/05/the-kingdom-of-silence), it is considered to be liberal. Okaz is similar to an Arabic version of the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). However, the liberalism displayed is in the Saudi context and subject to censorship by the government. According to a [BBC article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14703480) on the Saudi Arabia media profile, the royal family owns or controls most of the Saudi press, and “On sensitive stories, newspapers tend to follow the editorial lead of the state news agency.”
According to
[Reporters Without Borders,](https://rsf.org/en/saudi-arabia) Saudi Arabia ranks low for press freedom at 170/180 on the 2017 World Press Freedom Index and indicates that Saudi Arabia has no independent media, the authorities tolerate neither political parties, unions, nor human rights groups, and the level of self-censorship is extremely high.” [Read our profile on Saudi Arabia’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/saudi-arabia-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Saudi Gazette appears to have a pro-reform tone, for example: “
[Over 9,000 women attend two league matches “.](http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/526265/SAUDI-ARABIA/Over-9000-women-attend-two-league-matches) Articles are typically sourced either through quotes or sourced to [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Press_Agency), the official news agency of Saudi Arabia, owned and controlled by the government. However, the Saudi Gazette covers [world news](http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/526286/World/Asia/Najib-raps-Singapore-ties-under-Mahathir) through credible least biased news agencies such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [Reuters.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/)
In general, the Saudi Gazette has little choice but to promote pro-government propaganda as there is no press freedom in Saudi Arabia.
