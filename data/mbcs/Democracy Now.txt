Analysis / Bias
In review, Democracy Now reports news with a strong left-leaning bias with moderate loaded words such as this
[House Oversight Chair: Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump Broke Federal Records Laws](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/3/22/headlines/house_oversight_chair_jared_kushner_ivanka_trump_broke_federal_records_laws). News stories are not typically sourced with hyperlinks, but they provide quotes and video in most cases.
Editorially, Democracy Now supports left-leaning causes such as pro-environment, progressive taxation, equal rights, and opposition to income inequality. Democracy Now does not report favorably on former President Trump:
[Human Rights Attorney to Trump: “Israel Is Not Interested in the Golan Heights for Security.”](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/3/22/human_rights_attorney_to_trump_israel) In general, most stories favor the left and denigrate the right.
