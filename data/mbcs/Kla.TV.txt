History
Established in 2012 by
[Ivo Sasek](https://www.kla.tv/26951), Kla.TV (or Klagemauer. TV) is associated with the [Organic Christ Generation (OCG)](https://www.srf.ch/sendungen/dok/ocg-radikale-christen-soehne-des-sektenfuehrers-ivo-sasek-bestaetigen-kindesmisshandlung), a cult in Switzerland. With about 2,500 followers, mainly in Germany, OCG blends biblical teachings with conspiracy theories like flat Earth beliefs, climate change denial, and [anti-Semitism](https://www.srf.ch/sendungen/dok/ocg-radikale-christen-soehne-des-sektenfuehrers-ivo-sasek-bestaetigen-kindesmisshandlung). Sasek, once a car mechanic turned self-proclaimed prophet, now disseminates these ideologies via Kla.TV, catering to skeptics of mainstream media and science, notably amplifying his controversial doctrines, particularly amid events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Funded by / Ownership
Kla.TV is linked to
[Ivo Sasek](https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/miriam-christ-fluechtete-aus-der-sasek-sekte-doch-um-richtig-frei-zu-sein-muss-sie-ihre-eltern-vor-gericht-besiegen-ld.1766767) and his Organic Christ Generation (OCG), which he leads. The platform’s funding details are unclear, but its ties to Sasek and OCG suggest the group’s resources may support it. Sasek’s various media and event projects likely bolster Kla.TV, through either direct funding or shared resources within his network. This connection casts light on the potential impact of OCG’s beliefs on Kla.TV content and editorial choices.
Analysis /Bias
Kla.TV hosts numerous conspiracy theories, and while it’s not feasible to analyze all, we analyzed some. One of the notable examples is promoted in an article titled
[“WEF, Great Reset and their masterminds – Is there a world conspiracy after all?”](https://www.kla.tv/Freemason-en/27896&autoplay=true) which redirects to a different page, [“World politics in the light of sect criteria.”](https://www.kla.tv/19191) In this piece, Ivo Sasek claims a global conspiracy led by the [World Economic Forum (WEF)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/) and its proponents, like [Klaus Schwab](https://www.weforum.org/about/klaus-schwab/), to establish a New World Order through the Great Reset.
Sasek’s claims represent the typical characteristics of conspiracy theories. He attributes complex global developments to a secretive elite group without providing substantial evidence. This approach oversimplifies the intricate dynamics of international relations and policy-making.
Another theory presented by Kla.TV is titled
[“The Dimming: Secret Weapon – Weather Manipulation.”](https://www.kla.tv/ClimateChange-en/19333&autoplay=true) This theory suggests that the widespread phenomenon of [chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) is not just mere [condensation trails](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2016/08/14/are-conspiracy-theorists-right-about-nefarious-chemtrails/?sh=66b451a47378) from aircraft but part of a global weather intervention operation. This theory, promoted by Dane Wigington through a [documentary](https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/the-dimming-full-length-climate-engineering-documentary/) and supported by [GeoengineeringWatch.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/geoengineering-watch/) ( a site criticized for promoting conspiracy theories and pseudoscience), claims to expose deliberate atmospheric particle dispersion as a means of climate engineering. The narrative relies on selective data and anecdotal evidence to challenge mainstream climate science, ignoring the consensus among climate experts. Its association with GeoengineeringWatch.org, known for controversial views, further undermines the theory’s credibility by aligning it with sources recognized for spreading misinformation.
Additionally, Kla.TV explores COVID-19 controversies through an interview with
[Prof. Dr. Werner Bergholz,](https://www.kla.tv/Vaccination-en/27867) challenging the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, reflecting a strong anti-vaccination bias. In yet another instance, Kla.TV endorses the debunked [flat Earth theory](https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/conspiracy-vs-science-a-survey-of-us-public-beliefs), claiming it’s unfairly censored.
Finally, they suggest a Masonic influence behind space exploration narratives and imply deceptive practices in space agencies like NASA; therefore, they also spread misinformation about NASA and space exploration, casting doubt on their legitimacy and fostering skepticism towards scientific institutions. This perspective contradicts widely accepted scientific facts and reflects a broader skepticism toward the objectives and discoveries of space exploration.
In general, Kla.TV, founded by Ivo Sasek, is a hub for conspiracy theories and pseudoscience, often echoing right-wing skepticism towards global institutions and scientific consensus. This platform is notable for its vast array of baseless claims, positioning itself as a unique source of misinformation.
