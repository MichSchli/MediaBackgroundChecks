Analysis / Bias
In review,
[according](https://thewire.in/media/india-big-media-paid-news) to [The Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-wire-india/) “most newspapers in India would be completely unprofitable were it not for government advertising and other kinds of rent that they are able to collect.” [Bloomberg ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/here-s-what-modi-spent-to-sell-the-india-story-around-the-world) “India’s Government spent $640 million on advertisements.” Therefore, it is crucial for the media to be close to the ruling government. Further, paid news, which is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_news_in_India) as an “organized practice in Indian newspapers and other media outlets, where news space and favorable coverage is exchanged for money,” is still [practiced.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44280188)
In July 2019,
[The Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/) [reported](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-modi-government-media-ad-spending-newspapers-press-freedom-a8990451.html) that PM Narendra Modi’s administration “had frozen all advertising spending with the publishers of the [Times of India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-india/), [The Hindu](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hindu/) and The Telegraph, three of the country’s highest circulation English-language outlets.” Deshabhimani [published an article](https://www.deshabhimani.com/news/national/davp-advt-ban-for-media-and-news-papers/807426) on this matter, critical of the Modi government’s practice of using ad spending to punish Indian media.
When it comes to national news reporting, Deshabhimani is critical of the Modi government and publishes articles such as this:
[“Center for abusing workers](https://www.deshabhimani.com/editorial/news-editorial-15-07-2019/810789).” Furthermore, most articles are poorly sourced, with some sourced through quotes rather than hyperlinks.
When covering world news pertaining to the United States, they publish stories with emotionally loaded headlines and with an anti-Trump tone, such as these:
[“Trump hates the film, the world hates Trump”](https://www.deshabhimani.com/news/world/donald-trump-migration-refugees/807514) and [“There is no clean air or water in India, China or Russia: Trump.”](https://www.deshabhimani.com/news/world/donald-trump/803434)
Editorially, Deshabhimani is strongly pro-Communist party with articles such as this:
[“The target is the Left; Just be careful.”](https://www.deshabhimani.com/articles/news-articles-16-07-2019/810954) In general, story selection and political advocacy favor the left.
