Analysis / Bias
The Prime minister of Spain is officially called the
[“President of the Government”](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/06/actually-trump-was-right-to-call-rajoy-president-of-spain-sort-of/) (Presidente del Gobierno). The current Prime Minister of Spain is Pedro Sánchez, who leans [center-left](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-center-left-finds-life-in-spain).
In review, Público publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as
[“The extreme right stirs up messages of hate and contempt against Roma people.”](https://www.publico.es/politica/ultraderecha-agita-mensajes-odio-desprecio-personas-gitanas.html#analytics-seccion:listado) For example, the article mentioned above reports on anti-gypsyism and racism and gives examples of anti-gypsy articles published by far-right media. A quote from the article highlights a far-right source’s headline, “Hordes of gypsies collapse the Emergency Department of the Salamanca Hospital like zombies.” The source of the headline, Mediterráneo Digital is a far-right media outlet that “spreads all kinds of racist, xenophobic, and misogynistic messages.”
When it comes to national politics, Publico publishes articles with a neutral tone, such as
[“Feijóo unblocks the negotiations to renew the CGPJ and notes the differences with Sánchez on taxes.”](https://www.publico.es/politica/feijoo-sanchez-reunion.html#analytics-seccion:listado) They also publish [PM Pedro Sánchez’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/spain-media-profile/) (left-center) perspective and the conservative People’s Party (PP) (right-center) leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo’s perspective. Further, they publish articles about the Spanish far-right party [VOX](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/spain-media-profile/) with a critical tone, such as [“This is how the Spanish far-right positions itself in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.”](https://www.publico.es/internacional/posiciona-ultraderecha-espanola-conflicto-rusia-ucrania.html#analytics-tag:listado) The article is subtitled, “Various far-right and neo-Nazi organizations have ties to groups in both countries, which has led them to take different positions on the issue.”
Regarding sourcing, Público uses quotes and sources such as
[Open Democracy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/opendemocracy/) and [The Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung](https://www.rosalux.eu/en/topic/3.about-us.html), a left-leaning non-profit organization for civic education affiliated with Germany’s ‘Die Linke’ (Left Party), and the Spanish news agency EFE. In covering the USA, Some articles use strongly loaded language, such as [“Joe Biden’s “disgusting” video: groping and kissing when approaching women and girls](https://www.publico.es/tremending/2020/03/09/el-repugnante-video-de-joe-biden-toqueteos-y-besos-al-acercarse-a-mujeres-y-ninas/),” and [“Biden lashes out at Trump and blames him for the assault on Capitol Hill: “His wounded ego matters more to him than our democracy.”](https://www.publico.es/internacional/biden-arremete-trump-le-culpa-asalto-capitolio-ego-herido-le-importa-nuestra-democracia.html#analytics-tag:listado) However, most times, world news comes from credible news agencies. In general, the news is fact-based and holds a moderately liberal editorial perspective.
