Funded by / Ownerships
Liberty Wire does not disclose who owns it. However, at the bottom of each page, it lists a copyright to Empire News LLC. Empire News LLC publishes the satire website
[Empire News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/empire-news/) and the Questionable [EnVolve](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/en-volve/).

Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Liberty Wire republishes news and summaries from other sources and does not produce original content. Further, the site is designed to look like the
[Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/) rendering it an imposter site that attempts to look like a legitimate source.
Liberty Wire republishes news from some of the least credible sources on the internet, such as
[The Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [OAN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/), and [National File](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-file/). All of these sources are far-right biased and fall on either the [Conspiracy-Pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/) or [Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) lists. The website retains the original headlines, which consistently feature emotional wording to denigrate the left, such as this [Florida Voters Send Monument Destroyers Packing in Repudiation of Marxist Agenda](https://nationalfile.com/florida-voters-send-monument-destroyers-packing-in-repudiation-of-marxist-agenda/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and often promote misinformation, especially regarding election fraud conspiracy theories and covid-19. For example, in this article from the low credibility,
[We Love Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/we-love-trump/) website [BREAKING: Peer-Reviewed Research Reveals Staggering Election Fraud](https://libertywire.net/breaking-peer-reviewed-research-reveals-staggering-election-fraud/). There is [no evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) of widespread election fraud that would have changed the election’s outcome.
In another article, they share Covid vaccine information from a person known to spread vaccine disinformation propaganda:
[Doctor Tenpenny Explains Why You MUST Refuse The Vaccine…](https://libertywire.net/doctor-tenpenny-explains-why-you-must-refuse-the-vaccine/) Dr. Tenpenny is an osteopath who famously claimed that the [Covid vaccine magnetizes people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/09/sherri-tenpenny-magnetized-vaccine-ohio/). In general, Liberty Wire is an imposter website that promotes propaganda, conspiracy theories, and disinformation daily.
Failed Fact Check
- They do not produce original content and therefore have not been fact-checked by a third party; however, the sources they republish have some of the worst track records with fact-checkers.
