History
[Founded in 2013](http://whois.domaintools.com/americanactionnews.com), American Action News is a conservative news and opinion website that lacks transparency. According to their [about page](https://americanactionnews.com/about/), “We aren’t a mainstream media organization and aren’t obligated to play by the rules of anti-Trump bias and political correctness. This gives us the freedom to pull no punches and fight for the causes real Americans believe in.”
American Action News has a contact page that lists the following address:
[625 First Street #183 Alexandria, VA 22314](https://americanactionnews.com/about/contact). This address is that of a [Holiday Inn](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/alexandria/axehd/hoteldetail). Interestingly, room #183 also hosts numerous questionable conservative websites such as [1600 Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/1600-daily/), American Update, For Liberty, and [Trump Train News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trump-train-news/). In total, [12 conservative websites](https://www.google.com/search?q=625+First+Street+%23183+Alexandria%2C+VA+22314&oq=625+First+Street+%23183+Alexandria%2C+VA+22314&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.11196j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) are linked to this room number in the Holiday Inn. Further, the website also lists another address linked to a virtual mailbox. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, American Action News does not perform original news reporting but takes quotes and snippets from other sources and adds opinions from a conservative perspective. Headlines and articles often contain moderate loaded emotional language such as this:
[U.S. Attorney Durham Releases Stunning Statement Disputing FISA Report](https://americanactionnews.com/articles/u-s-attorney-durham-releases-stunning-statement-disputes-fisa-report). This story is sourced from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). All other stories reviewed utilized mostly credible mainstream sources such as [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), and [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/).
Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left. The website also features a section called
[Opinion](https://americanactionnews.com/section/opinion), which links to the same stories found on its homepage. This sort of makes sense as this is primarily an opinion website. In general, the news reported on American Action News is rooted in fact, with conservative opinion interjected and a completely one-sided perspective. They have also promoted [election fraud](https://americanactionnews.com/government/2021/03/24/potential-mass-voter-fraud-discovered-in-montana/) conspiracies and misinformation regarding [Covid-19](https://americanactionnews.com/government/2022/05/03/documents-pull-back-the-curtain-on-vax/).
Finally, they republish opinion columnists such as
[Ben Shapiro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ben-shapiro-bias-rating/), [Dennis Prager,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/) and [Larry Elder](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/larry-elder-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), all of whom have poor track records with fact-checkers.
