[The Institute for the Study of Globalization and Covert Politics (ISGP)](https://isgp-studies.com/about) is a website that uncovers hidden agendas in global politics by examining the lesser-known aspects and making connections between political figures, organizations, and events. The site’s content is deeply skeptical of mainstream narratives, proposing alternative explanations for events. The site’s founder is Joel van der Reijden. ISGP is based in the Netherlands.

Analysis / Bias
ISGP’s content, exemplified by articles such as
[TikTok: Forcing and Brainwashing Western Youths into Race Mixing,”](https://isgp-studies.com/tiktok#tiktok-raw) often blends actual observations with speculative theories to suggest hidden agendas, particularly around race and social behaviors. This narrative approach, filled with provocative language, aligns with conspiracy theory styles, aiming to provoke emotional responses rather than offer objective analysis.
The article mentioned above makes speculative claims, such as TikTok’s AI promoting interracial relationships as social engineering, without empirical backing and relies on assumptions about content recommendation motives. Additionally, its discussions on racial preferences in relationships use outdated and offensive terminology, simplifying complex social dynamics into charged narratives.
Claims about TikTok’s ownership further delve into conspiracy theory territory, suggesting control by Western elites and think tanks without solid evidence. The critique extends to mainstream media and the U.S. Congress, reflecting the author’s personal views rather than a balanced analysis. Mixing legitimate social media concerns with baseless theories and racially sensitive narratives undermines the article’s credibility. A more objective approach would separate observation from speculation, avoid racially insensitive language, and rely on solid evidence.
Similar issues arise in other ISGP articles, such as
[“Violent Black Crime 5 To 30 Times Higher Than White: Murder & Gang Rape Statistics From Us, Eu, Australia, Africa; Plus: Arab & Latino Stats,”](https://isgp-studies.com/black-crime-numbers-statistics#africa-gang-rape) which also blend disputed claims with discussions on sensitive topics like race, crime rates, and genetic factors in IQ, often lacking the necessary context and caution in interpretation.
Another claim from ISGP suggests that the
[Soros, Ford, Carnegie, Gates, and Rockefeller foundations](https://isgp-studies.com/liberal-cia-immigration) are financing efforts to oppose Trump’s policies and support immigration, black activism, and feminism, which frames philanthropic activities as a deliberate strategy to stir social unrest and advance a globalist, multicultural agenda. This claim is a conspiracy theory that oversimplifies philanthropy’s complex motives and impacts.
Furthermore, many articles on the ISGP site promote pro-Trump right-wing conspiracies and often rely on questionable sources like
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) or AI-generated charts.
In general, the content presented by ISGP demonstrates a clear bias towards far-right ideologies. The narratives often rely on conspiracy theories and speculation, lacking factual evidence and objectivity for any credible analysis. Therefore, readers should approach information from this source with a healthy amount of skepticism and seek independent verification from credible and reputable sources.
