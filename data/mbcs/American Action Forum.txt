In review, the American Action Forum website provides news and research with minimal bias in wording, such as
[The National Implications of Marylandâ€™s All-Payer System](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-national-implications-of-marylands-all-payer-system/). This research is properly sourced to organizations such as [Rand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rand-corporation/) and the [CBO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/congressional-budget-office-cbo/). The website also provides Op-Eds, which favors the right and often the policies of President Trump, such as this: [Pulse of the American economy is strong thanks to better policy](https://www.americanactionforum.org/oped/pulse-of-american-economy-is-strong-thanks-to-better-policy/#ixzz6G2juKJay). In general, AAF advocates for a free-market economy with minimal regulations.
When reporting on climate change, AAF does not deny the human impact on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); however, they advocate for [free-market solutions](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-green-new-deal-scope-scale-and-implications/) rather than the recommendations by scientists.
