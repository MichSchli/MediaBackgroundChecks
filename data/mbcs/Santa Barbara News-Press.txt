Analysis / Bias
According to an
[NYT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) article, Wendy McCaw has been the paper’s owner since the year 2000. In 2006, [McCaw was accused of interfering with the newsroom editorial judgment at the News-Press](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/17/business/media/17paper.html). According to an [L.A. Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) article, [“Five editors and a columnist resigned over the controversy,”](http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/07/nation/na-newspress7) and according to [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), the News-Press endorsed Donald Trump: “ [These Are the Only 6 Newspapers in the Country to Endorse Donald Trump”](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/donald-trump-newspaper-endorsements-214390). The paper includes news stories, local news, national and world news, sports, editorials, and classified coverage.
Articles and headlines of local news coverage contain minimal emotional language, such as this
[Litigation anticipated against Ty Warner and Four Seasons](https://newspress.com/litigation-anticipated-against-ty-warner-and-four-seasons/). The national news is provided by reporters and has minimal bias, such as this [FDA expected to approve Pfizer vaccine Monday](https://newspress.com/fda-expected-to-approve-pfizer-vaccine-monday/).
Editorially, the Santa Barbara News-Press endorsed Donald Trump for President in 2020
[Why we are again endorsing Donald Trump for president](https://newspress.com/why-we-are-again-endorsing-donald-trump-for-president/). A review of op-eds demonstrates that almost all of them favor a conservative perspective, such as this [Conservative solutions for major problems](https://newspress.com/conservative-solutions-for-major-problems/) and [Olympics remind us why nationalism is necessary](https://newspress.com/olympics-remind-us-why-nationalism-is-necessary/). Finally, during the 2020 election, they promoted the election fraud narrative, which has been debunked: [Trump supporters right to doubt election](https://newspress.com/trump-supporters-right-to-doubt-election/).
