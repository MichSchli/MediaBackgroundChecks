Analysis / Bias
[The editorial stance](https://innovation.journalismgrants.org/media/s%C3%BCddeutsche) of Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) is liberal and center-left. Articles and headlines feature moderately loaded wording such as [“Why aren’t there any boycotts against Amazon or Google?”](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/suisse-secrets-steuermoral-banken-korinna-schoenhaerl-1.5532521?reduced=true) and [“When right-wing populists have a say.”](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/schweden-eu-ratspraesidentschaft-schwedendemokraten-1.5724034) A quote from the article reads, “many fear the influence of the Sweden Democrats (Right Wing Nationalist) – especially when it comes to decisions on migration and climate protection.”
Articles are written by reporters and often feature investigations and first-person accounts. For example, in 2022, according to the investigation led by Süddeutsche Zeitung, some of Credit Suisse’s clients include
[corrupt politicians](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/investigation-exposes-credit-suisse-state-of-press-freedom-in-switzerland/) and convicted criminals. SZ published [Suisse Secrets,](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/suisse-secrets-schweizer-geheimnisse-e155615/) investigations such as “ [Why I Did It”](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/suisse-secrets-schweiz-credit-suisse-quelle-1.5532512) and [“That’s the leak”](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/suisse-secrets-schweizer-geheimnisse-e155615/?reduced=true) sourced from The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).
Editorially, there is a reasonable balance between right and left; however, based on a few articles, our review indicates SZ favors the left with features such as
[“Everything about the climate crisis.”](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/klimakrise-sz-klimamonitor-e670150/) A quote from the article reads, “How man is destroying the earth – and how we can still save it.” Generally, the news is reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
