Analysis / Bias
When reporting Japanese national news, they are balanced in covering both sides of issues, and minimally loaded wording such as this
[Suspect signaled Abe killing in letter to Unification Church critic](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/07/17/national/abe-suspect-letter/). When reporting international news, The Japan Times reports with minimal bias using credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, op-eds cover a reasonable balance of opinions and are not hyper-partisan such as this
[Nuclear risks mount as tensions rise and arsenals grow](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/06/17/editorials/nuclear-proliferation/). In general, the Japan Times reports news factually and with minimal bias.
