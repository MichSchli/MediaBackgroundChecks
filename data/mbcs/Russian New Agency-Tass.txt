History
[Founded in 1902](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS), Russian News Agency (TASS) is a major news agency in Russia. Tass is the largest Russian news agency and the fourth largest in the world after [Reuters](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), the [Associated Press (AP)](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [Agence France-Presse (AFP)](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, TASS is a news wire service similar to the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), but there is no comparison between the two. The only similarity is both use low-biased headlines and wording; however, TASS is 100% Russian propaganda all the time. It is impossible to find an article critical of Vladimir Putin and his administration. TASS does not cite sources in their news reporting and often omits reporting that is not positive about Russia. Further, they report favorably on former President Trump and often promote disinformation directed at Trump’s opponents such as this: [Joe Biden’s son and his partners received $16.5 million from Burisma — Ukrainian MP](https://tass.com/world/1090971). This story lacks sourcing to back claims. The bottom line is TASS is a puppet of the Russian Regime.
