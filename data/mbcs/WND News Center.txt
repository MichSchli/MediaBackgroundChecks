[WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/). The stories that appear on WND News Center come from [WND’s News Center category](https://www.wnd.com/category/wnd-news-center/). The website lacks transparency as they do not clearly disclose they are a part of WND.
Founded in 1997, World Net Daily, or WND, is a politically conservative news and opinion website. WND was founded by
[Joseph Farah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Farah), who also serves as editor-in-chief. WND also publishes books under the imprint WND Books. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
WND is a Questionable online news source with a far-right bias and dabbles in right-wing conspiracies such as
[President Obama’s birth certificate](http://www.wnd.com/2009/07/103137/). They also use misleading clickbait headlines that do not always match the article’s content. WND also has an abysmal track record with fact-checkers, as seen below.
During the CoronaVirus outbreak of 2020, WND has been
[accused](https://www.newsguardtech.com/coronavirus-misinformation-tracking-center/) of peddling false and misleading information regarding the virus.
Several different media outlets have criticized WND for both promoting white nationalism and peddling conspiracy theories. For example, the
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/01/meet-the-alt-left-the-gops-response-to-its-alt-right-problem/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9837c74cd058) and [Columbia Journalism Review](https://archives.cjr.org/essay/unamerican_1.php) have written articles describing WND as Far Right and Alt-Right. Further, The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/worldnetdaily) labels WorldNetDaily as an antigovernment extremist group.
