Analysis / Bias
eBaum’s World publishes content uploaded by its users, usually related to humorous viral internet content, such as
[“How the ‘Talking Stage’ Has Ruined Modern Dating.”](https://www.ebaumsworld.com/articles/how-the-talking-stage-has-ruined-modern-dating/87363362/) They also publish straight news such as “ [Pics or It Didn’t Happen’: Twitter Employee with Muscular Dystrophy Fired via Tweet by Elon Musk.”](https://www.ebaumsworld.com/articles/pics-or-it-didnt-happen-twitter-employee-with-muscular-dystrophy-fired-via-tweet-by-elon-musk/87364046/) A quote from the article reads,” There’s total ownage, and then there’s what Halli just did to Elon Musk. Bodybagged. Maybe if Elon wasn’t so obsessed with trying to make people laugh all the time, he’d have a few minutes to answer a simple email and avoid being absolutely embarrassed on his own app.” Here is the same news reported by [NBCnews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/): “ [Elon Musk takes aim at a Twitter employee who was let go, claims he ‘did no actual work.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-takes-aim-twitter-employee-was-let-go-claims-no-actual-work-rcna73742)
Editorially, there is content critical of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden through their “funny” category, such as
[Trump Embarrasses Himself after Hyping up His Hilarious $99 NFT Trading Cards](https://www.ebaumsworld.com/articles/trumps-nft-trading-card-collection/87320658/) and [Twitter Reacts to Joe Biden’s Cookie-filled Breakfast, ‘Those Better Have Fiber in Them.’](https://www.ebaumsworld.com/articles/those-better-be-fiber-cookies-joe-biden-eats-cookies-for-breakfast-a-very-presidential-investigation/87347683/) In general, the website’s bias is determined by user submissions. We have found evidence of both sides being covered and hence rate them least biased; however, most stories lack hyperlinked sourcing and are uploaded by users without editorial oversight, making it challenging to check the accuracy of claims.
