History
Founded in 2022 by
[L Todd Wood](https://ltoddwood.com/), The Miami Independent is a conservative news and opinion website with a history of publishing misinformation. According to its [about page](https://miamiindependent.com/about-the-miami-independent/), “Miami has long-suffered from a lack of opposing opinions to the corporate media narrative. That changes today with the launch of The Miami Independent. We aim to create Miami, and Florida’s premier investigative newspaper, and will bring truth no matter where that truth lands.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Miami Independent is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate local newspaper. All of the websites use the same design template using an old newspaper font for their logos.
The website publishes local news related to Miami that routinely favors the right, such as this:
[By Watering Down Anti-CCP Property Law, Citadel’s Ken Griffin Shows True Allegiance](https://miamiindependent.com/by-watering-down-anti-ccp-property-law-citadels-ken-griffin-shows-true-allegiance/). This article does not contain outside sources.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [Trump Train Keeps Chugging Along In Doral](https://miamiindependent.com/trump-train-keeps-chugging-along-in-doral/). While denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [Biden Thanks Coast Guard Member For Hurricane Rescue — Days Before Vax Mandate Firing.](https://miamiindependent.com/biden-thanks-coast-guard-member-for-hurricane-rescue-days-before-vax-mandate-firing/)
The Miami Independent also promotes
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://miamiindependent.com/criminal-neglect-cdc-knew-covid-vaccine-could-cause-myocarditis-in-young-males-months-before-telling-the-public/). In general, this is an imposter website that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
