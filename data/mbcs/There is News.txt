Analysis / Bias
In review, There is News disclaims in their tagline that they are a satire site with this: “Not real, but so funny.” A typical satire story reads like this
[The man is more fertile the more hair is on his chest, according to a study](https://thereisnews.com/the-man-is-more-fertile-the-more-hair-is-on-his-chest-according-to-a-study/). Although this source is written in English, it is generally not grammatically correct or easy to read, but it is pretty funny.
