Analysis / Bias
GeekWire provides original technology news reporting focusing on Seattle, Washington, and the nation. Headlines are low-biased and accurately describe the content of the article, such as this
[Cardiac Dimensions raises $35M for device to treat condition associated with heart failure](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/cardiac-dimensions-raises-35m-for-device-to-treat-condition-associated-with-heart-failure/). This story, like all reviewed, is properly sourced from credible outlets like the American Heart Association, Business Wire, and medical journals.
The website also frequently reports on Amazon, such as this
[Amazon is shutting down its cloud storage service Amazon Drive](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-storage-service-amazon-drive/) and Google [Google now employs more than 7,200 in Washington state — up from 4,500 workers just prior to the pandemic](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/google-now-employs-more-than-7200-in-washington-state-up-from-4500-workers-just-prior-to-the-pandemic/).
Editorially, they do not have a dedicated section for op-eds; however, they do report on political issues as it relates to tech. Political reporting usually reports straight news, but sometimes reports negatively on former President Trump like this
[Is Microsoft tweeting shade at Trump? Probably not, but many followers feel like they’re in on a joke](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-tweeting-shade-trump-probably-not-many-followers-feel-like-theyre-joke/). On the other hand, they also publish articles critical of current President Joe Biden, such as this [Bezos vs. Biden: Amazon founder calls out president over inflation and corporate taxes](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/bezos-vs-biden-amazon-founder-calls-out-president-over-inflation-and-corporate-taxes/). In general, GeekWire is reasonably balanced in story selection and fact-based in reporting.
