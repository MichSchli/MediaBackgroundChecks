Analysis / Bias
In review, Novinite publishes articles with minimal emotionally loaded language, such as
[“BSP Leader Korneliya Ninova: We Share the President’s Motives, the Government Generates Crises”](https://www.novinite.com/articles/203026/BSP+Leader+Korneliya+Ninova%3A+We+Share+the+President%27s+Motives%2C+the+Government+Generates+Crises) (BSP – Bulgarian Socialist Party is the opposition party) and [“PM Borisov: Accession to Schengen and the Eurozone Is a Top Priority](https://www.novinite.com/articles/197638/PM+Borisov%3A+Accession+to+Schengen+and+the+Eurozone+Is+a+Top+Priority).” Under the crime section, they report stories such as [“The Accused Vasil Bozhkov: I Have Photos, Records and Witnesses for 60 Million Given to PM Borissov and Minister Goranov”.](https://www.novinite.com/articles/204825/The+Accused+Vasil+Bozhkov%3A+I+Have+Photos%2C+Records+and+Witnesses+for+60+Million+Given+to+PM+Borissov+and+Minister+Goranov) This report is balanced, representing all sides.

[Channel News Asia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/channel-news-asia-cna/) and the [ independent.co.uk](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/).

Finally, Novinite covers world news through republishing from credible sources such as the [AP](https://www.novinite.com/articles/204727/Trump+to+the+Governors%3A+%E2%80%9CMost+of+You+are+Weak%E2%80%9D).
