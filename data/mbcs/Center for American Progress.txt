History
[Founded in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress), The Center for American Progress (CAP) is a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization founded by John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign. According to their [about page](https://www.americanprogress.org/about/mission/), “The Center for American Progress is an independent, nonpartisan policy institute that is dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans, through bold, progressive ideas, as well as strong leadership and concerted action. Our aim is not just to change the conversation but to change the country.” The liberal and factually mixed website [Think Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/think-progress/) was funded by the Center for American Progress.

Analysis / Bias
In review, CAP’s reporting typically favors establishment progressive issues, which result in a liberal bias with report selection. There is often moderate loaded language in headlines and articles such as this:
[America Can Do Big Things: A Budget Plan for a Better Future](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2019/06/11/471022/america-can-big-things-budget-plan-better-future/). This story is appropriately sourced to the [CBO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/congressional-budget-office-cbo/) and right-leaning sources such as [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/). In general, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right. A thorough review of content for the last 2 years demonstrates appropriate sourcing of information and mixed factual content due to failed fact checks. See below.
