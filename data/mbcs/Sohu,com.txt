Analysis / Bias
In 2019, China’s online watchdog, The Cyberspace Administration of China (The CAC), ordered Baidu, a Chinese multinational technology company based in Beijing but incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and Sohu to suspend news services for a week.
[Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) reported with the headline [“Baidu, Sohu Get Caught in Latest Chinese Internet Clampdown.”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/baidu-sohu-get-ensnared-in-latest-chinese-internet-clampdown) The CAC announced that “it was starting a six-month effort to eradicate “vulgar” information.” In other words, there is significant censorship by the government.
In review, Sohu publishes news that is generally pro-Chinese government, such as this
[“Xi Jinping chaired the China-Africa Solidarity Anti-epidemic Summit and delivered a keynote speech”](https://www.sohu.com/a/402544820_585752?code=4bfd2b69e02cd5a9ccc4148d19387bef&spm=smpc.home.top-news1.1.1592428630166lYVMo95&_f=index_cpc_0) and often celebrates President Xi Jinping [“Xi Jinping: I believe that humanity will eventually overcome the epidemic.”](https://www.sohu.com/a/402539918_585752?code=5481fff81670930405bc4c9ffeee6d0f&spm=smpc.news-home.top-news1.2.1592429181528W8Ksfk2&_f=index_chan08cpc_1_0) Regarding sourcing, Sohu utilizes questionable Chinese news sources such as [Xinhua](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/xinhua-news-agency/), Guancha News, and the state-owned Beijing News, as well as credible sources such as [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/).
While many stories are factual and low biased, there is a significant bias by omission where they do not report negatively on the Chinese Government due to Chinese government pressure. When covering the USA, Sohu typically uses minimally loaded emotional language and a negative tone to describe the Trump administration
[“What internet search data reveal about Trump’s first year](https://www.sohu.com/a/217272479_617737?spm=smpc.content.share.1.1578096000023oXoZw5N).” In general, Sohu publishes pro-State propaganda.
