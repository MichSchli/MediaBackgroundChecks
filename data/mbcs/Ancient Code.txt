We analyze, question, and debate the Ancient Astronaut Hypothesis which suggests that in the distant past, visitors from elsewhere in the universe came to earth and helped kick-start our civilization.” Further, they claim some of their “writers and editors have appeared on a number of popular TV documentaries including Ancient Aliens by the History Channel, What on Earth by the Discovery Channel, and Gaia TV among others.” The Editor-in-chief is [Ivan Petricevic](https://www.ancient-code.com/author/ivanpetricevic/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Ancient Code is a pseudoscience website that primarily reports on ancient aliens and pseudo-archaeology. An example of pseudo-archaeology can be found here:
[Archaeologists Find Location of ‘Wedding At Cana’ Where Jesus turned ‘Water Into Wine’ Miraculously.](https://www.ancient-code.com/archaeologists-find-location-of-wedding-at-cana-where-jesus-turned-water-into-wine-miraculously/) This story is sourced to the [Questionable Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), which has a terrible track record with fact-checkers and makes highly sensational claims. Another article claims that humans live in a “ [galactic zoo”](https://www.ancient-code.com/alien-life-galactic-zoo/) run by aliens. Maybe we are, but they’re certainly isn’t a shred of evidence to suggest this, which makes it a conspiracy theory at best.
In general, news on this website is mixed between far-out pseudoscience and some that come close to being credible in science and history. For the most part, the website is deceiving with its mix of factual and false content.
