Analysis / Bias
We The People Daily does not conduct original reporting. They report news based on other sources and add conservative commentary. Articles and headlines often contain emotional wording that favors the right and denigrates the left such as
[Biden Now Hated Among Even The Most Naive Americans](https://www.wethepeopledaily.com/2022/08/22/biden-now-hated-among-even-the-most-naive-americans/). Although this story contains information from [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) Polling, they do not provide a hyperlink to the source. In another story, they link to the [Daily Wire](https://www.wethepeopledaily.com/2022/08/22/biden-now-hated-among-even-the-most-naive-americans/), which is a questionable source that frequently fails fact checks.
When it comes to sourcing, they rarely offer hyperlinks but state the name of the sources. Many times they rely on poor sources as follows:
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/)(Questionable) [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/)(Questionable) [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/)(Questionable)
After the 2020 election, We The People promoted false stolen election conspiracies such as this
[New Movie Proves The 2020 Election Was Stolen](https://www.wethepeopledaily.com/2022/05/02/new-movie-proves-the-2020-election-was-stolen/). This article is based on the debunked film by Dinesh D’Souza, a frequent purveyor of [disinformation](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-checking-dinesh-dsouzas-2000). Further, they published false information regarding Covid-19 vaccines, such as this [Democrats Desperately Try To Bury The Link Between Vaccines & This Disease](https://www.wethepeopledaily.com/2021/12/02/democrats-desperately-try-to-bury-the-link-between-vaccines-this-disease/). In this article, they quote a doctor known to make false statements regarding vaccines where he claims that the vaccine causes heart inflammation. There is [no evidence](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/12/no-credible-evidence-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-dramatically-increase-heart-attack-risk-contrary-to-flawed-abstract/) to support this claim.
In general, We The People Daily publishes news and opinion stories that 100% favor the right while frequently denigrating the left with loaded emotional language.
Failed Fact Checks
- A third party has not fact-checked them; however, they rely on sources that fail fact checks, and we provide evidence above of false information.
