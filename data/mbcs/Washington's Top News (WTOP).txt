In review, local Washington, D.C. news is covered via journalists and uses minimally loaded words in headlines such as this:
[Man sought in assault outside Metro station](https://wtop.com/dc/2019/01/man-sought-in-assault-outside-metro-station/). [The Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) syndicates national and international news.
