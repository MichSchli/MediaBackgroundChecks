Analysis / Bias
In review, 13 News Now WVEC reports local news primarily through TV news video and accompanying text. Local news is presented with minimally loaded wording:
[Police: Three people shot at RiffHouse Pub in Chesapeake](https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/chesapeake-police-investigating-shooting-at-riffhouse-pub/291-55aa0026-21a1-46a9-ac52-7a2409839b83). National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other TEGNA TV stations.
13 News Now also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local Virginia politics though 13 News NowTV. Again, the wording is low biased such as this:
[Virginia Senate committee axes bill that would end police immunity](https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/virginia-senate-committee-axes-bill-that-would-end-police-immunity/291-d7f0a16d-2889-4d8e-bd3f-aa3010665324). Further, the website does not publish editorial commentary. Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
