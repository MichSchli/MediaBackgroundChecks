Analysis / Bias
In review, the Care2 website allows users to create, browse and sign
[online petitions](https://www.thepetitionsite.com/create-a-petition.html) for various left-leaning causes with a strong focus on the environment and human rights. Some of the open petitions on the website today are related to animal rights, LGBTQ, and reproductive rights. The Care2 website also publishes news related to food, health, spirituality, nature, etc.
While many of the articles published are credible or at least harmless, some are full-blown pseudoscience. For example, they have an article detailing the
[benefits of Moxibustion](https://www.care2.com/greenliving/could-you-benefit-from-moxibustion.html), which is a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine involving the burning of Mugwort over acupoints. There is [zero evidence](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/moxibustion/) to support any positive benefits from Moxibustion; however, burns have been reported. Care2 does not openly reject vaccinations or make false claims about an [autism link](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/) when it comes to vaccinations. Still, they offer skepticism about their safety, which differs from the consensus of science.
