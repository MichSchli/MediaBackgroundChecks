Analysis / Bias
In review, WOFL covers local news such as crime, sports, weather, and entertainment for Orlando, Florida, and surrounding areas. Local news typically relies on minimally loaded language in headlines such as this:
[President Trump expected to attend Daytona 500 this weekend, report says](https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/president-trump-expected-to-attend-daytona-500-this-weekend-report-says). Crime reporting utilizes slightly more emotion in headlines such as this [Police warn Clermont residents of electricity tax scam](https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/police-warn-clermont-residents-of-electricity-tax-scam). The national news is derived from the [Associated Press](https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/police-warn-clermont-residents-of-electricity-tax-scam).
Editorially, WOFL Fox 35 Orlando does not offer opinion pieces, however, they do report on politics that again comes from the Associated Press. In general, WOFL is factual in reporting with little editorial bias.
