Analysis / Bias
In review, Stranger Than Fiction News publishes stories from other sources with a short summary. The sources utilized range from credible such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) to the questionable, such as the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) and random [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd4uwJjf4sI&feature=youtu.be), which lack evidence. Essentially, the whole premise of this website is to highlight @jonrohnson’s questionable tweets. This source also promotes right-wing conspiracy theories [such as this](https://twitter.com/jonrohnson/status/1254854641579368448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Eembeddedtimeline%7Ctwterm%5Eprofile%3Ajonrohnson%7Ctwcon%5Etimelinechrome&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fstfnreport.com%2F) “they’re CRACKING DOWN on freedom. it’s the f’n crack down, the lock down, the 1984 nightmare you know ain’t ok, and while they’re raping your rights without the astroglide they’re dosing you with 5g, spraying you like bugs and fluoridating vaccinating grooming your kids biatch.”
This is not a credible source.
