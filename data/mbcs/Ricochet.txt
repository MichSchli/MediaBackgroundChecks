Analysis / Bias
In review, Ricochet features contributors who pay a subscription fee to post articles on the website. Due to this fact, the bias of articles ranges from right-center to far-right depending on the writer. This is an example of a piece with a strong right-wing bias in wording and political affiliation:
[Why We Need Trump.](https://ricochet.com/471368/why-we-need-trump/) Not only does this article contain loaded words such as “corrupt Hillary,” but it also does not list a source of any kind. Other articles do you use sourcing, but many do not.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, they published misinformation such as this
[Johns Hopkins Doc: Natural Immunity Is Superior to Vaccine; Biden Admin Has it Backwards](https://ricochet.com/1067336/johns-hopkins-doc-natural-immunity-is-superior-to-vaccine-biden-admin-has-it-backwards/). This unsourced article is [not supported by evidence](https://healthfeedback.org/infection-induced-immunity-versus-vaccine-induced-immunity-weighing-the-benefits-and-risks/). In general, most stories favor the right and sometimes promote misinformation.
