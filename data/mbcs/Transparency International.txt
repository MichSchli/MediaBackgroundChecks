Analysis / Bias
In review, Transparency International measures and reports corruption to prevent criminal activities. The organization
[defines corruption](https://www.transparency.org/about) as “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, which eventually hurts everyone who depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority.” The website features the [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019?/news/feature/cpi-2019), which ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, according to experts and business people. For example, the United States is ranked 23/180 and has a low to moderate corruption level, whereas the Scandinavian countries have very low corruption.
In case you are wondering, Somalia is rated last with extremely high corruption levels. The website also publishes well-sourced news such as this

Politically, Transparency International takes pro-science positions such as concern for

When reporting on world leaders such as USA president Donald Trump they often report negatively, such as this: [TRUMP’S GOLD-PLATED SON-IN-LAW AND OTHER POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THE WHITE HOUSE](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/trumps_gold_plated_son_in_law_and_other_potential_conflicts_of_interest). In general, information is highly factual and displays a minimal bias as they stay focused on their agenda of monitoring corruption, which frequently crosses party lines.
