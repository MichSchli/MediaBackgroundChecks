Analysis / Bias
In review, Frontiers publishes scientific research studies in a wide range of journals. For the most part, all of these are sound science with legitimate peer review. However, in 2015 Frontiers Media was added to
[Beall’s ](https://beallslist.weebly.com/) [Predatory Open Access Journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing) list. In short, Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals (open access or not).
Frontiers have also
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
Generally, we still rate Frontiers pro-science. Of the thousands of journal articles they have published, only a select few were retracted, and the act of retraction shows diligence toward credible science.
