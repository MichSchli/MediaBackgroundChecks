Analysis / Bias
In review, Red People is a typical extreme right fake news website from Macedonia. A sample article reads like this: “
[Massive Muslim Terror Network just Discovered in Chicago after Cops get Clue about what they were Hiding.](http://www.redpeople.us/2017/04/12/massive-muslim-terror-network-just-discovered-chicago-cops-get-clue-hiding/)” This story then sources another questionable website called the [Conservative Daily Post](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-daily-post/), which does not even mention a terror network. The whole story is about a Muslim business owner who was selling cigarettes illegally and then Red People giving the opinion that he is funneling money to terrorist groups without evidence. This is a fake news website with virtually every article favoring President Trump.
