History
Launched in 2020, American Journal Daily is a website that publishes conservative news and commentary. The website lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page, disclose ownership, or name editors. Further, they do not admit their conservative bias using a
[vague description](https://americanjournaldaily.com/) of the website that reads, “We bring you everything you need to know about American news…each and every day.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
American Journal Daily does not disclose ownership. However, a search reveals that Ryan Mauldin possibly owns them via
[Viral Media Partners LLC](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_tx/0802449643). The website does not disclose that Mauldin has worked for [Republican campaigns](http://profitablepropertymanagement.com/podcast/ryan-mauldin-vici-media-interview/), including Donald Trump in 2016, and publishes other conservative websites such as [Patriot Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/patriot-journal/) and [GOP Daily Brief](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gop-daily-brief-bias/). Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
American Journal Daily does not conduct original reporting but rather adds commentary to news reported from other sources. We found that they use a mix of factually mixed sources such as
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). Articles and headlines usually contain highly emotional wording critical of Democrats, such as this [Kamala Gets Snubbed By Her Own White House Announcer – She Steps Up To Podium And He Skips Her, Introduces Union Activist Instead](https://americanjournaldaily.com/kamala-white-house-skip/).
Editorially, they do not label opinion pieces but usually include right-biased opinions in news articles. All stories reviewed favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this piece
[Joe Biden Just Suffered A Historic Presidential Loss – Now His Republican Opponents Have A Double-Digit Lead Over Democrats](https://americanjournaldaily.com/biden-sinking-president-gop/). Politically, they favor border control [Oversight Republicans Drop ICE Hammer On Biden – They Accuse The President’s Border Rules Of “Dereliction Of Duty,” “Affront To Law”](https://americanjournaldaily.com/oversight-republicans-ice-biden/) and advocate for another Trump Presidency [Trump Just Handed Biden Another Major Loss – National Poll Puts Donald Ahead Of Joe In The Handling of “Key Issues.”](https://americanjournaldaily.com/trump-biden-loss-key-issues/) In general, news stories are rooted in fact but consistently only present one-sided opinions.
