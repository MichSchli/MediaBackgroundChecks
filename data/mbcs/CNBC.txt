Analysis / Bias
In review, CNBC uses emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Billionaire megadonor Robert Mercer cuts back on support for GOP after being scrutinized for backing Trump”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/robert-mercer-scales-back-gop-support-after-scrutiny-for-backing-trump.html?recirc=taboolainternal) and [“Trump resumes attack on the Fed as markets sink again.”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/24/trump-resumes-attack-on-the-fed-as-markets-sink-again.html) CNBC typically utilizes credible sources such as campaignlegal.org, fec.gov (federal election commission), poll.qu.edu (Quinnipiac University), and [Bloomberg News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/)
While news reporting is typically balanced and related to financial news, there is frequent negative coverage of former President Trump, such as this:
[A potential Trump impeachment is a ‘huge risk’ for 2019, expert says](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/26/trump-may-face-impeachment-by-house-democrats-expert-says.html). In general, story selection moderately favors the left, which has resulted in [criticism](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/11/05/cnbc_biased_you_dont_say_128641.html) of liberal bias by Right-leaning [Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/).
