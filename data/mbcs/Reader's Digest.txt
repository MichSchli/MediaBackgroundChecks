[“14 Things You Didn’t Know About Donald Trump”](https://www.rd.com/culture/donald-trump-facts/) with the content selectively favoring President Trump; however it is thoroughly sourced by utilizing credible news sources such as [Politico.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [The New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Fortune Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fortune-magazine/), [Huffington Post (HuffPost)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/), and [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), as well as factually mixed sources such as [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/?s=CNN) and [Townhall.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/)
