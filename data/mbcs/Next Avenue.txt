History
Founded in 2012, Next Avenue is a digital platform launched by
[PBS](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/) that offers original and aggregated journalism aimed at baby boomers. Next Avenue is PBS’s first venture to begin on the Internet rather than broadcast television. Most news is geared to the aging baby boomer’s health, nutrition, and political policy. According to their [about page](https://www.nextavenue.org/about-us/), their mission is “to meet the needs and unleash the potential of older Americans through the power of media.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Next Avenue is published and owned by Twin Cities PBS. Revenue is derived through donations and sponsorship from individuals, foundations, and corporations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Next Avenue publishes news and information geared toward an older audience. The website covers Health, Money and Policy, Work and Purpose, Living, and Caregiving. Articles and headlines do not use loaded language such as this
[Finding Love With a Foster Dog During the Pandemic](https://www.nextavenue.org/finding-love-with-a-foster-dog-during-the-pandemic/). While most news is factual, they do stray under their Health section, promoting [alternative health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-medicine/) practices such as [acupuncture](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-directory-acupuncture/) [How Acupuncture Can Help With Pain During the Pandemic](https://www.nextavenue.org/how-acupuncture-can-help-with-pain-during-the-pandemic/). They also [promote](https://www.nextavenue.org/different-treat-cancer/) [alternative cancer treatments](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), which do not align with the consensus of traditional medicine. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias; however, this source does promote unproven pseudoscience, which forces us to rate them Mixed for factual reporting.
