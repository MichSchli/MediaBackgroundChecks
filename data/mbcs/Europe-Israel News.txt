Analysis / Bias
Europe-Israel News promotes a Zionist vision of Israel in which
[Jerusalem is recognized](https://www.europe-israel.org/about/) as the capital of Israel. News and information are broken down into categories such as Muslim Anti-Semitism, Christian Anti-Semitism, Anti-Zionism, and Anti-White Racism.
The website promotes news stories that always favor Israel and often denigrate the left, Muslims, and people of color such as this
[Biden / Harris would be a disaster for Israel and American Jews](https://www.europe-israel.org/2020/11/biden-harris-seraient-un-desastre-pour-israel-et-les-juifs-americains/) and this [A Jewish journalist murdered by a racist black who wanted to kill a white … no media talks about it, they prefer Jamal Khashoggi, an anti-Semitic Islamist activist](https://www.europe-israel.org/2018/10/un-journaliste-juif-assassine-par-un-noir-raciste-qui-voulait-tuer-un-blanc-aucun-media-nen-parle-ils-preferent-jamal-khashoggi-un-activiste-islamiste-antisemite/). Although news stories are often sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Jerusalem Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-jerusalem-post/), [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), and [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/), they are often one-sided in their promotion of Israel and denigration of the left.
Editorially, Europe-Israel News promotes Zionism and often portrays Muslims and people of color negatively by focusing only on crimes they commit, such as this
[Ramadan 2021, 17th day: already 116 attacks and 544 deaths by Islamists. During this time, “Islamophobia” has not killed anyone yet](https://www.europe-israel.org/2021/05/ramadan-2021-17eme-jour-deja-116-attentats-et-544-morts-par-les-islamistes-pendant-ce-temps-lislamophobie-na-encore-tue-personne/). They also write negatively against any politician who does not support Zionism, such as this [Macron is the most anti-Israeli president: Scandalously anti-Israel statements by Castex and Le Drian, vote at the WHO of an anti-Israel resolution proposed by the Islamists, etc… In 2022, we will remember that!](https://www.europe-israel.org/2021/05/macron-est-le-president-le-plus-anti-israelien-declarations-scandaleusement-anti-israeliennes-de-castex-et-de-le-drian-vote-a-loms-dune-resolution-anti-israelienne-proposee-par-les-islamistes/) And this [United States: 124 American generals accuse Biden of stealing victory from Trump and denounce Biden’s Marxist turn](https://www.europe-israel.org/2021/05/etats-unis-124-generaux-americains-accusent-biden-davoir-vole-la-victoire-a-trump-et-denonce-un-virage-marxiste-de-biden/). This story promotes the false claim that the US presidential Election was stolen from Trump. In general, they promote Zionism with little tolerance for anyone who opposes them.
