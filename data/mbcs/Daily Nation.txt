Analysis / Bias
In 2018, the government shut down
[three television stations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-politics/kenya-government-ignores-court-order-suspending-shutdown-of-three-tv-stations-idUSKBN1FL4V1) (Citizen TV, Inooro TV, NTV) because they planned to live-stream the symbolic presidential inauguration of opposition leader Raila Odinga. [Odinga](https://qz.com/africa/1049814/elections-in-kenya-2017-raila-odinga-says-results-were-hacked-for-president-uhuru-kenyatta/) (leader of the [left-wing ](https://www.theelephant.info/features/2017/07/17/the-final-lap-will-nasa-catch-jubilee/)opposition party NASA) accused President Uhuru Kenyatta (right-wing leader of the ruling political party Jubilee) of stealing the election. Further, three NTV journalists, Linus Kaikai, Larry Madowo, and Ken Mijungu, spent the night at the [Nation Media Group](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/ntv-journalists-spent-night-on-studio-floor-to-escape-arrest-9018) headquarters in Nairobi to avoid arrest. Nation Media Group operates the television outlet NTV and is also the owner of the Daily Nation and their respective websites. Further, in April 2018, [eight columnists resigned](https://www.reuters.com/article/nmg-results/update-2-kenyas-nation-media-plays-down-columnist-resignations-idINL8N1RV0RT), accusing “management of letting the government interfere in decisions about the coverage of a heated presidential election last year.”
In review, Daily Nation reports local/national news with minimal use of loaded wording and reports factually, such as this
[Scare as car plunges into the ocean in Mombasa](https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/mombasa/scare-as-car-plunges-into-the-ocean-in-mombasa-3237104). World news is generally republished from [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/). The Daily Nation rarely hyperlinks to external sources when it comes to sourcing.
Editorially, Daily Nation favored the left in the past with support for the opposition with stories such as this
[“US media firm targeted Raila Odinga with attack ads, report says”](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/us-media-firm-targeted-raila-odinga-with-attack-ads-report-says-1245202) (2017). However, over time they have limited criticism of the government and began praising the current right-leaning government, such as this [“Good news for farmers”](https://nation.africa/kenya/blogs-opinion/editorials/good-news-for-farmers-3236706) (2020). Further, the owner of Nation Media Group, businessman/philanthropist religious leader [Aga Khan](https://www.akdn.org/about-us/his-highness-aga-khan/biography-his-highness-aga-khan) has close ties with the right-leaning government of Kenya as he visits and discusses his [investments.](https://www.president.go.ke/2018/04/13/communique-on-the-official-visit-to-kenya-by-his-highness-the-aga-khan-hereditary-imam-of-the-shia-imami-ismaili-muslims-during-his-diamond-jubilee-nairobi-13th/) Although there is a lack of criticism of the Right-leaning government, they often advocate for more liberal causes such as [Gender Activism](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender) and [Climate Change](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/youths-demand-govt-action-on-climate-change-policies-205722). Therefore, we rate them left-center when it comes to editorial bias.
