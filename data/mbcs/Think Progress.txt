Founded in 2005 by
[Judd Legum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Legum), ThinkProgress is an American political news website. It is a project of the [Center for American Progress Action Fund](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-american-progress/), which is a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization founded by John Podesta, who was Chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. ThinkProgess states they are editorially independent.
According to the ThinkProgress
[about page](https://thinkprogress.org/about/) they are a “news site dedicated to providing our readers with rigorous reporting and analysis from a progressive perspective. Over the past decade, the site has evolved from a small rapid response blog to a newsroom of reporters and editors covering the intersections of politics, policy, and social justice.”
ThinkProgess has been

Analysis / Bias
In review, ThinkProgress publishes breaking news and investigative reports with a left-leaning bias in story selection. There is the moderate use of loaded language that favors the left in headlines, such as this:
[Trump calls immigration at southwest border an ‘invasion,’ echoing New Zealand gunman’s rhetoric](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-invasion-immigration-new-zealand-shooter-f15927a41b1a/). This article is properly sourced to [US News and World Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/us-news-world-report/) and [The Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-strategic-and-international-studies/). In another article, also critical of President Trump, there is again a moderately biased headline: [Trump’s new budget abandons all pretense of being fiscally responsible](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-budget-broken-promises-deficit-debt-d09489905303/). This story is also properly sourced to Whitehouse.gov, [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and The [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
A review of several stories shows consistent favoritism for liberal/progressive policies, with negative stories about conservatives. In particular, there is a considerable amount of negative stories regarding President Trump. Although ThinkProgress has a consistent bias against conservatives, they also portray further left progressives in a more a
[negative light](https://thinkprogress.org/?s=bernie+sanders). In general, ThinkProgress always favors the left and denigrates the right. In particular, they favor the more moderate wing of the Democratic party.
