Analysis / Bias
Cleveland Scene covers local arts, food, culture, music, entertainment, and news for the Cleveland Metro Area. Local news is generally reported via staff writers, with some in-depth pieces. Straight news uses minimally loaded words such as this:
[The Nauti Mermaid Has Closed After Nearly 20 Years in Business](https://www.clevescene.com/food-drink/the-nauti-mermaid-has-closed-after-nearly-20-years-in-business-41204235). News stories are generally sourced through quotes, first-hand accounts, or hyperlinks.
Editorially, Cleveland Scene leans strongly left with progressive opinion/news pieces such as these:
[While In Effect, Ohio’s Abortion Ban Led to Chaos, Suffering, and Worse Health Care, Doctor Says](https://www.clevescene.com/news/while-in-effect-ohios-abortion-ban-led-to-chaos-suffering-and-worse-health-care-doctor-says-40763199) and [Foiled Plot Against Michigan Governor Shows Far-Right Domestic Terrorism is a Threat — And the Calls Are Coming From Inside the White House](https://www.clevescene.com/news/foiled-plot-against-michigan-governor-shows-far-right-domestic-terrorism-is-a-threat-and-the-calls-are-coming-from-inside-the-white-house-34300896). Generally, story selection moderately favors the left, while opinion-oriented pieces use strong emotional wording to denigrate the right. Most information is sourced properly.
