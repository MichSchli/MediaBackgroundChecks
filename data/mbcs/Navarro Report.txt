Analysis / Bias
In review, The Navarro Report publishes debunked voter fraud allegations which are then shared on social media platforms such as

Further, in addition to being prepared by someone who doesn’t have the necessary [background](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2020/12/17/white-house-advisor-peter-navarro-releases-dubious-voter-fraud-report/?sh=5f89e1b71205) on election issues, these unsubstantiated claims are disputed by [ President Trump’s own](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/) departments of Justice and Homeland Security. [According](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/) to a [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/) article dated Jan. 6, 2021 “ Out of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential election, 61 have failed” and “The decisions have come from both Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by Trump.” Finally, Attorney General William Barr made a declaration regarding voter fraud, with a quote that reads “the U.S. Justice Department has uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election.”
The Navarro Report website consists of three volumes of alleged election fraud against President Donald Trump that is presumably compiled by Navarro. The volume titles use highly emotional language such as this “The Immaculate Deception, The Art of the Steal, and Yes, President Trump won.” Navarro’s reports have been debunked and rebuked by credible sources such as
[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2020/12/17/white-house-advisor-peter-navarro-releases-dubious-voter-fraud-report/?sh=245348df1205) and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/18/this-might-be-most-embarrassing-document-created-by-white-house-staffer/). Some debunked claims are that Trump’s early election-night leads in several states later won by Biden were the result of fraud, when in fact it was the result of [counting mail-in ballots](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/11/30/trump-renews-ballot-dump-conspiracy-theory-claim-heres-why-its-bogus/?sh=4cc6ff9d1dca) that heavily favored Biden. He also promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that [Dominion Voting Software](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/be36dc6d-0df4-4c20-addf-fca72be46150/The%20Immaculate%20Deception%2012.15.20.pdf) had ties to Hugo Chavez in Venezuala “Dominion’s roots may be traced to an effort by the Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez to rig his sham elections.” This conspiracy was found to be [completely false](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/03/facebook-posts/no-hugo-chavezs-family-does-not-own-dominion-votin/). Finally, Navarro’s claims of election fraud come from very poor sources that have failed numerous fact checks such as [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), [OANN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/one-america-news-network/), [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/), [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), and [Steve Bannon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gnews/).
Although not related to the Navarro Report website, Peter Navarro also frequently promotes Covid-19 conspiracies and falsehoods such as providing misleading information regarding Hydroxychloroquine
[“Navarro Doesn’t Give Full Picture On Hydroxychloroquine”](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/navarro-doesnt-give-full-picture-on-hydroxychloroquine/). He also promoted the [falsehood](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/14/blog-posting/false-tiktok-claim-high-unemployment-killing-more-/) that [ lockdowns will kill more people than the virus](https://triblive.com/news/trump-aide-peter-navarro-claims-lockdowns-will-kill-many-more-americans-than-covid-19/). In general, The Navarro Report and Peter Navarro frequently promote false and misleading information that is not credible.
