Analysis / Bias
In review, the Health Sciences Institute publishes news and information related to alternative health. Virtually all information on this website promotes medicine and cures that are not supported by the consensus of science. For example, this article
[Shrink tumors and keep cancer from spreading with baicalein](https://hsionline.com/2020/03/18/shrink-tumors-with-baicalein/). While there is some evidence that [Baicalein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5085714/) has some effect on tumors, there is not a broad consensus, and there is [not enough efficacy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) to override traditional science-based treatments. Further, HSI is pro-Christian and promotes [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) regarding the HPV vaccine, such as this [Our tax dollars are paying for dangerous, ineffective vaccinations](https://hsionline.com/2010/06/17/gardasil-taxes/).
According to the
[National Cancer Institute (NIH)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet), Gardasil is “highly effective in preventing infection with the types of HPV they target when given before initial exposure to the virus—which means before individuals begin to engage in sexual activity.” Finally, [according](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12/agora-huckabee-conservative-bible-cures/) to [Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/), they have “found an [incredible cure](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/12/agora-huckabee-conservative-bible-cures/) for cancer hidden in the Book of Matthew. For just $74, you, too, could discover the secret.”
