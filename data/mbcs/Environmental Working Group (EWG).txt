Analysis / Bias
The Environmental Working Group publishes a list of the “Dirty Dozen” fruits and vegetables that contain the most pesticides. The list is based on data from the Pesticide Program Residue Monitoring of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While many of the articles on this website are factual, many fall into the pseudoscience category, such as promoting the cell phone-cancer link when there
[is no evidence to support it](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/cancer-controversies/mobile-phones-wifi-and-power-lines). Due to pesticides, they often promote organic foods, which does not consider that numerous pesticides are used in organic farming. They also oppose [GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), which go against the [consensus of science](https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/08/17/cancer-juries-scientific-certainty-monsanto-roundup-ruling-explained/) regarding safety.
Editorially, EWG aligns with the left regarding environmental issues, often promoting pseudoscience.
