Analysis / Bias
In review, Blasting News publishes editions in Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the USA. Readers can customize their news feeds by selecting channels. For example, for this review, I chose the following channels: Donald Trump, Democratic Party, Foreign Affairs, and Viral Stories. The majority of news stories provide videos to go along with the text. Headlines typically are low-biased such as this:
[California: Thousands evacuated as firefighters struggle to contain the Kincade wildfire](https://us.blastingnews.com/news/2019/10/california-thousands-evacuated-as-firefighters-struggle-to-contain-the-kincade-wildfire-003005931.html). This story is properly sourced to the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
In reviewing news stories about former President Trump, there is minimal bias present, such as this:
[Syria: Trump announces troops are pulled from the region, threatens Turkey economically.](https://us.blastingnews.com/opinion/2019/10/syria-trump-announces-troops-are-pulled-from-the-region-threatens-turkey-economically-002999847.html) This story is appropriately labeled as an opinion piece and is sourced to Twitter and a [Fox News](https://us.blastingnews.com/opinion/2019/10/syria-trump-announces-troops-are-pulled-from-the-region-threatens-turkey-economically-002999847.html) video. News coverage of Democrats is also low-biased such as this: [Democrats request tougher diplomacy in North Korean negotiations](https://us.blastingnews.com/news/2019/09/democrats-request-tougher-diplomacy-in-north-korean-negotations-002978159.html).
This review covers only a small portion of the news published on the website, and therefore we cannot determine if other articles are biased and factual. However, based on this small sample, they appear to be least biased and factual in reporting.
