Analysis / Bias
In review, The World Can’t-Wait is an organization and website that fights against fascism, empire, and war. All articles are well-sourced with credible information. The issues favored by The World Can’t-Wait are those aligned with the political and socialist left. The wording is somewhat loaded to favor the left as well. Currently, WCW is very much
[against the former Trump administration,](https://worldcantwait.net/index.php/calls-to-action/8919-in-the-name-of-humanity-we-refuse-to-accept-a-fascist-america) as they are viewed as fascists. However, WCW also opposed Obama and his use of military force in many regions of the world.
Editorially, WCW has been described as a
[Revolutionary Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Communist_Party,_USA) (RCP) affiliate. While they oppose the conservative right, they frequently rail against corporate-leaning Democrats such as Joe Biden [Never-Ending Injustice: State Secrets and the Torture of Abu Zubaydah](https://worldcantwait.net/index.php/torture/9138-75-house-representatives-urge-president-biden-to-close-the-prison-at-guantanamo-bay). Generally, stories are reasonably factual; however, there is a lack of transparency with ownership and one-sided propagandistic reporting that favors the socialist/communist left.
