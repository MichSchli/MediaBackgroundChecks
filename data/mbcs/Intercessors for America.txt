Analysis / Bias
Intercessors for America (IFA) demonstrates a clear bias favoring
[former President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and his ideologies, which is evident in their editorial choices and article framing. Although they occasionally reference sources like [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), their narratives are significantly shaped by conservative Christian perspectives. For instance, the articles “ [Michigan Supreme Court to Keep Trump on the Ballot”](https://ifapray.org/blog/state-supreme-court-decides-to-keep-trump-on-the-ballot/) and [“A Powerful Time of Prayer for President Trump!”](https://ifapray.org/blog/a-powerful-time-of-prayer-for-president-trump/) interweave political events with pro-Trump perspectives. This article blends political reporting with religious interpretations that sympathize with Trump’s agenda, showing a partisan bias.
Another article, titled
[“Dave Kubal: Biden’s ‘Battle for the Soul of America’ is Really a Battle Against US,”](https://ifapray.org/blog/dave-kubal-bidens-battle-for-the-soul-of-america-is-really-a-battle-against-us/) has a religious and politically charged perspective. The author suggests President Biden’s speech is a spiritual attack on Americans with certain values, framing it as a profound spiritual battle rather than just political disagreement. The article claims Biden’s views oppose biblical values and advocate for prayer and action against perceived radical ideologies. This narrative is heavily infused with religious and partisan bias, casting doubt on its credibility as a balanced or objective news source.
Similarly, “
[Reversing Biden’s Curse”](https://ifapray.org/blog/reversing-bidens-curse/) frames Biden’s actions and words as spiritual attacks or curses, starkly contrasting their more favorable depiction of Trump and his policies.
This pattern of reporting, favoring Trump while casting his political adversaries in a negative, often spiritualized conflict narrative, reveals a strong bias. It shows support for Trump and suggests a lack of objectivity in their overall news presentation. Additionally, their coverage on topics like COVID-19 vaccines reflects skepticism, questioning the government’s honesty and vaccine safety.
For example, The article
[“The Government Lied About the COVID Shot”](https://ifapray.org/blog/the-government-lied-about-the-covid-shot/) expresses skepticism about COVID-19 vaccines. It suggests that the government misled the public about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines, citing concerns about vaccine injuries and potential government dishonesty. The article features a video by [Dr. Naomi Wolf](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2023/05/23/the-latest-fact-checks-curated-by-media-bias-fact-check-05-23-2023/) from [Bannon War Room](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/war-room-steve-bannon-bias/) discussing documents obtained through a FOIA request, which she claims reveal the government’s knowledge of the vaccine’s risks. The tone of the article and the comments section indicate a critical stance towards the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.
Further, they promoted Trump’s false stolen election narrative like this
[Major Answered Prayer in Fight for Election Integrity](https://ifapray.org/blog/major-answered-prayer-in-fight-for-election-integrity/), relying on low credibility sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
In general, Intercessors for America (IFA) relies heavily on conservative Christian viewpoints and spiritual interpretations in its reporting, compromising its credibility as a news source. Additionally, the lack of transparency about its funding and ownership is concerning.
