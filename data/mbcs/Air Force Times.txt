Analysis / Bias
In review, Air Force Times covers military news and defense policy with the use of minimally loaded language such as this:
[“Making Air Force One great again”](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2018/07/17/making-air-force-one-great-again/) and [“Transgender airman: ‘I would like to see them try to kick me out of my military.’”](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2017/07/26/transgender-airman-i-would-like-to-see-them-try-to-kick-me-out-of-my-military/?utm_source=clavis) All articles are properly sourced to credible media outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Military Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-times/), and .gov sites. Editorially, they are balanced with primarily centrist views that slightly lean left on the issues of gender and lean right in their support of military strength. Air Force Times generally covers military news with very low bias in reporting.
