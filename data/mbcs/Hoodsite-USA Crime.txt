History
[Founded in 2019](https://whois.domaintools.com/hoodsite.com), Hoodsite-USA Crime is an uncensored crime news and media website which reports on real-life events. According to their [about page](https://hoodsite.com/about/#), “No accident is beautiful, no crime is pretty, no homicide is nice to look at. But by not seeing these situations for what they truly are, no matter how gut-wrenching a news incident might be, you are censoring yourself from the truth and accept being lied to by not seeing things with your own eyes.”
The website completely lacks transparency as they do not disclose names associated with the website or ownership.
In 2020, the hoodsite domain pointed to USAcrime.com

Analysis / Bias
In review, Hoodsite-USA Crime publishes videos of crimes and accidents. All the videos are shocking, disturbing, and often nauseating to watch. We will not share links here, and this review is to inform the public that this is a highly graphic website that is not for everyone. Further, they warn that you must be 18 or over to view the videos. We are not rating this website for bias as that is not a factor. We will rate them Mixed for factual reporting because they completely lack transparency, although the videos appear unedited and real.
