[Republican candidates](https://www.post-journal.com/opinion/in-our-opinion/2019/10/city-council-endorsements/). A review of editorial commentary shows a reasonable balance between right and left without delving into extremes; however, slightly more op-eds favor the right such as this: [Illegal Immigrants Shouldnâ€™t Be Able To Use A License To Vote](https://www.post-journal.com/opinion/in-our-opinion/2019/10/illegal-immigrants-shouldnt-be-able-to-use-a-license-to-vote/).
