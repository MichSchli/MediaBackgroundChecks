Analysis / Bias
BCN covers various topics related to the African American community, including politics, culture, education, and social justice.
In overview, The website promotes gun ownership through articles like
[“Law-Abiding Residents in North Carolina No Longer Need the Government’s Permission to Buy a Gun.”](https://blackcommunitynews.com/no-more-gov-permits-buy-guns-north-carolina/) The author portrays the new law as a positive development and quotes a passage from the article stating, “The next frontier is eliminating the requirement to seek government permission to carry handguns concealed” and “Gun-rights advocates hope to achieve constitutional carry and national reciprocity for all states.” However, the article lacks opposing viewpoints or evidence that challenge the positive perception of gun ownership, which creates a biased impression in favor of promoting gun ownership.
Another article,
[“Star Parker: Nikki Haley Brings a New Face to Freedom,”](https://blackcommunitynews.com/star-parker-nikki-haley-brings-a-new-face-to-freedom/) is a clear example of conservative bias. Parker does not present a balanced or objective view of Nikki Haley or the issues she discusses. The Author only reports on information favorable to Haley and her candidacy.
When it comes to sourcing, BCN generally uses quotes such as in this article, which is quoted from
[The Wall Street Journal.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) However, it does not provide a link to the article, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the information. In general, BCN holds a right-leaning conservative editorial bias. Although there is no evidence of patently false information, they lack transparency and do not properly source information resulting in a mixed factual rating.
