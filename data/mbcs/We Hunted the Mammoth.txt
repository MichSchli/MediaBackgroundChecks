Analysis / Bias
In review, We Hunted the Mammoth exposes sexism and misogyny, often reporting on Men’s Rights Activists, the Alt-Right, and Christian Conservatives. The author is David Futrelle, who uses sarcasm directed at Misogynists such as this:
[Redditors are outraged to discover that women want “hot fun sex with men they’re sexually attracted to](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2020/01/24/redditor-outraged-to-discover-that-women-want-hot-fun-sex-with-men-theyre-sexually-attracted-to/).” This story is sourced correctly back to the Redditor. Other stories expose individuals affiliated with the Alt-Right, such as this: [Is Fat Acceptance part of a vast conspiracy to lower Western birth rates? Stefan Molyneux seems to think so](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2020/01/25/is-fat-acceptance-part-of-a-vast-conspiracy-to-lower-western-birth-rates-stefan-molyneux-seems-to-think-so/).
From a political standpoint, the author does not have a favorable view of former President Trump:
[Trump fans have a new woman to hate: rape accuser E. Jean Carroll. And some of them are positively gleeful](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2019/06/22/trump-fans-have-a-new-woman-to-hate-rape-accuser-e-jean-carroll-and-some-of-them-are-positively-gleeful/). Although We Hunted the Mammoth will criticize some Bernie Sanders supporters for their disdain of Hillary Clinton, they generally support the Democratic party as a means to counter Trump: [#ResistTrump today by lighting a fire under the Democrats](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2017/01/25/resisttrump-today-by-lighting-a-fire-under-the-democrats/). Generally, information is factual and presented with a left-leaning bias in story selection and wording.
