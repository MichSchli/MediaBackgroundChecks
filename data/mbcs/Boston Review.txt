The Boston Review was founded in 1975 as New Boston Review by Juan Alonso, Richard Burgin, and Anita Silvey. According to their
[about page](http://bostonreview.net/about), “Boston Review is a political and literary forum—a public space for discussion of ideas and culture. Independent and nonprofit, animated by hope and committed to equality, we believe in the power of collective reasoning and imagination to create a more just world.” You can view their [masthead here](http://bostonreview.net/masthead).

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Boston Review reports news and opinions using moderately loaded words such as this:
[The Global Calculus of Climate Disaster](http://bostonreview.net/science-nature/ashley-dawson-global-calculus-climate-disaster). Although ultimately opinion-based with a quote such as this: “Global capitalism is no longer simply characterized by uneven and combined development, it is characterized by uneven and combined disaster,” it is well sourced to credible information.
Another article has negative connotations directed at former President Trump and his policies:
[Trump’s Sleight of Hand Will Bring Ruin to American Workers.](http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality/lauren-carasik-trumps-sleight-hand-will-bring-ruin-american-workers) Again, this article is also properly sourced. Politically, the Boston Review is pro-environment and presents socially liberal views.
