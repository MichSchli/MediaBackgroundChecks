Analysis / Bias
Many conspiracy theorists believe HAARP can be used for
[mind control](http://www.haarp.net/mindcontrol.htm) and controlling the weather. HAARP.net certainly endorses these theories. None of these claims have been proven and have been [effectively debunked](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4122). HAARP.net also provides links to many conspiracy websites and books.
