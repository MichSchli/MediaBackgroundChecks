Analysis / Bias
Dame Magazine openly declares its progressive stance, stating it is more interested in “truth and justice” than “balance,” which suggests that the publication may prioritize stories and perspectives that align with its ideological viewpoint.
For example, the article
[“Has America Given Up on Its Future?”](https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/08/08/has-america-given-up-on-its-future/) critiques the American political landscape for its lack of long-term vision. The article cites credible sources such as [The New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/), [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), and [Patch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/patch/).
Another article,
[“The U.S. Has an Accountability Problem,”](https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/03/07/trump-santos-accountability/) frames the U.S. as having a significant issue with accountability, particularly in politics. It cites [ NPR (National Public Radio)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and [NBC ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/)News and, like all others reviewed, is fact-based.
Editorially, stories and opinions favor a progressive left perspective, such as this with negative reporting on the GOP regarding Transgender issues:
[The GOP Has a Master Plan to Criminalize Being Trans](https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/08/14/the-gop-has-a-master-plan-to-criminalize-being-trans/). They also support and advocate for Democratic President Joe Biden with the article [“Why Aren’t Biden’s Victories Winning Him Any Points?”](https://www.damemagazine.com/2022/04/12/why-arent-bidens-victories-winning-him-any-points/) which criticizes the media for its portrayal of [President Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), suggesting that his accomplishments are being downplayed. This aligns with a progressive viewpoint that seeks to highlight the achievements of a Democratic president. In general, Dame Magazine is fact-based and holds progressive left political biases.
