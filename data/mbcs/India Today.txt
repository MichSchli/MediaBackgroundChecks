Analysis / Bias
India Today reports international news with low-biased wording, and they source properly from credible mainstream media sources such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). The current Prime Minister of India is [Narendra Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi), the head of the conservative [Bharatiya Janata Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party) (BJP). Editorially, India Today rarely criticizes Modi and often reports favorably on him, such as this [PM Narendra Modi crosses 60mn followers on Twitter](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-narendra-modi-twitter-followers-cross-60-million-1702179-2020-07-19). In general international news is reported factually, while national news holds a right-center bias favoring the current government.
