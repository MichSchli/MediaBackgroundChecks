Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters without borders](https://rsf.org/en/malaysia), Malaysia’s media environment is being threatened by increasing censorship.
In review, Malaysia Today uses loaded language in their headlines and articles, such as “
[Gerakan Contented To Be A Mosquito Party?](https://www.malaysia-today.net/gerakan-contented-to-be-a-mosquito-party/)” Malaysia Today tends to poorly source their articles such as this: “ [Zahid: Pakatan Needs To Resolve DAP, PPBM Problems Before Registration](https://www.malaysia-today.net/zahid-pakatan-needs-to-resolve-dap-ppbm-problems-before-registration/)”; however, they report international news with [low bias](https://www.malaysia-today.net/dojs-1mdb-probe-independent-of-najib-trump-meet/) and maintain factual reporting.
Editorially, they favor the right, such as
[The Time Has Come For A Malay Right-Wing Party](https://www.malaysia-today.net/2018/08/30/the-time-has-come-for-a-malay-right-wing-party/). In general, they face censorship and usually favor the government resulting in the production of propaganda.
