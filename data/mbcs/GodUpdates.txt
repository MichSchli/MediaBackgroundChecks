Analysis / Bias
GodUpdates publishes positive news stories that often connect to religious themes. News stories are based on other sources and written by GodUpdate staff. Articles and headlines are minimally biased and accurately describe the story, such as this
[Grizzly Bear Charges, Barely Missing UPS Delivery Man, And Security Cameras Caught It All](https://www.godupdates.com/grizzly-bear-charges/).
Regarding sourcing, they usually rely on credible outlets such as
[People Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/people-magazine/) and [GoodNewsNetwork](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/goodnewsnetwork/). We also found they use social media posts and videos as a reference.
When covering science issues, they report accurately but often attribute outcomes to miracles such as this
[Miracle Baby Survives Covid and Liver Transplant, All Before His First Birthday](https://www.godupdates.com/miracle-baby-survives-covid-liver-transplant/), and [Father On His Way To Church Manages To Narrowly Avoid Collision And Says It’s All God](https://www.godupdates.com/priest-avoid-collision-miracle/). In fact, they have a section dedicated to [miracles](https://www.godupdates.com/tag/miracle-2/).
Editorially, they do not typically report on politics; however, opinions advocate a Christian perspective that aligns with the right such as this
[COVID Has Already Shut Down Some Churches, Don’t Let It Cancel Christmas, Too](https://www.godupdates.com/shoeboxes-for-operation-christmas-child-covid-19/). In general, the news is fact-based, but often they attribute positive outcomes to miracles that cannot be proven.
