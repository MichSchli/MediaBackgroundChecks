Analysis / Bias
Information is Beautiful is recognized for its presentation of complex data in an aesthetically pleasing manner, covering a diverse range of topics such as arts, entertainment, culture, current affairs, politics, science, technology, and health. The platform prioritizes transparency and accessibility regarding data sources, facilitating user verification and further data exploration.
For instance, the diagram
[” Over Two-Thirds of Refugees in Germany Are in Work after Five Years”](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/821-germany-refugees/) sheds light on Germany’s approach to integrating a significant number of asylum seekers, with an emphasis on unity and labor. At the end of the article, Information is Beautiful offers additional resources related to this topic, including access to the underlying data and [sources](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-half-of-refugees-find-jobs-within-five-years/a-52251414#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20published%20on,within%20five%20years%20of%20arriving.) and options to download the graphic. Clicking on ‘View the data’ leads to a spreadsheet, while ‘See the source’ directs to the original data source, in this case, [dw.com.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/)
Another example is a collection of articles and graphics related to the Ukraine-Russia war. This collection is a curated set of resources offering various perspectives and data visualizations on the conflict. Like the previous diagram, the reader can view the article’s datasets on topics like major natural gas and oil producers, Russian gas and oil imports, dependency levels on Russian energy, and comparisons of Ukrainian cities. Sources vary from mixed (like
[Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/)) and unknown sources like warsawinstitute.org to credible (BP,.opec.org, Statista, oec.world, and [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/)).
Finally, a chart titled
[“Left vs. Right (US)”](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/left-vs-right-us/) from Information is Beautiful visualizes the United States’s political spectrum through a flower-like [diagram](https://informationisbeautiful.net/2009/left-vs-right/). It uses emotionally loaded terms such as ‘fairness’ and ‘aggression to depict ‘votes for fairness’ for the left and ‘votes for aggression’ for the right. Labeling one political side as voting for ‘fairness’ and the other for ‘aggression’ could be seen as biased because it assigns inherently positive and negative characteristics to the respective sides. This labeling can influence the viewer’s perception of the political ideologies.
In general, based on the analysis of the content and sources used by Information is Beautiful, we rate them as left-leaning due to the subjective presentation of certain topics, which may lean towards a liberal perspective.
