Analysis / Bias
In review, The Post Millennial covers Canadian news, Breaking News, Politics, and Opinions. When reporting news, there is the moderate use of loaded words in headlines such as
[5 big Trudeau military failures.](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/5-big-trudeau-military-failures/) For the most part, news articles are sourced properly and factually based, though there is a strong right-leaning bias in story selection that denigrates the left and, in particular, PM Justin Trudeau. The opinion/editorial pages provide little balance and primarily support Conservative and Libertarian positions. Further, the Post Millennial sometimes reports unsubstantiated claims that have not been proven, such as this: [WATCH: Justin Trudeau allegedly went for drinks with woman Liberals claim is a “white nationalist](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/watch-andrew-scheer-suggests-that-justin-trudeau-took-faith-goldy-out-for-drinks/).”
