Analysis / Bias
Based on the article
[“E.U. Names China and Russia as Top Hackers”](https://euobserver.com/rule-of-law/140558) from [EUobserver.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/eu-observer/), 163.com, operated by NetEase, has been associated with several cybersecurity issues. Furthermore, 163.com’s digital services, including news coverage, are subject to China’s regulatory and political landscape, which could influence content and editorial stance. Here are some examples of national news coverage by 163.com.
The article
[ “Hot Interpretation | Understand Xi Jinping’s “People’s City from his trip to Shanghai,”](https://www.163.com/news/article/IL7N06UF000189FH.html) sourced from [CCTV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cctv-america/), demonstrates a clear bias towards promoting the [Chinese government’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/#google_vignette) leadership and its initiatives, consistent with the typical characteristics of state-affiliated media in China. The article’s framing and narrative align with the government’s perspective, contributing to a positive portrayal of its actions and policies. A quote from the article reads, “General Secretary Xi Jinping has always regarded solving the most direct and practical interests of the people as the top priority of urban development.”
Another article, titled “
[The United States and the West have increased their military support for Ukraine, and a large number of military-industrial companies have profited from it,”](https://www.163.com/dy/article/IL6E96MT0514R9OJ.html) discusses how Western nations, particularly the United States, have intensified their military support for Ukraine, leading to significant profits for Western defense companies. It emphasizes the economic aspects of this support, highlighting the profits gained by Western defense companies. This emphasis on economic interests could be seen as framing the situation from a financial perspective. The article quotes a Serbian European researcher critical of NATO’s role, and although there is no external hyperlink, the [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) article titled “ [U.S. funding for Ukraine arms has poured into Pennsylvania, Arizona and Texas”](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-funding-ukraine-arms-has-poured-into-pennsylvania-arizona-texas-2023-11-28/) provides additional context and verification for the claims made in the 163.com article. It confirms significant funding has been allocated to various U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, to arm Ukraine.
While the news is generally reported factually, it is misleading due to strong censorship of anything negative towards
