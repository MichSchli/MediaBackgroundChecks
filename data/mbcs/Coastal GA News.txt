History
Coastal GA News is a conservative news and opinion website published by
[Metric Media LLC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/metric-media/) that is designed to look like a local news source. Metric Media publishes over 1000 websites with the same design and about page that reads “Metric Media was established to fill the void in community news after years of decline in local reporting by legacy media. Our approach is to provide objective, data-driven information without political bias. We provide 100% original reporting, including to share as much data as possible from government and other publicly available sources.”
Metric Media LLC lacks transparency as they do not have an about page that describes their conservative agenda, nor discloses funding and ownership.
Funded by / Ownership
The Metric Media LLC website does not disclose ownership. The Metric Media Foundation owns each local website. The CEO of Metric Media is conservative political consultant
[Bradley Cameron](https://www.courthousenews.com/partisan-news-outlets-seek-to-fill-void-in-us-news-deserts/). Each website receives revenue through advertising and donations to the Metric Media Foundation. The Foundation then funds the websites’ production.
