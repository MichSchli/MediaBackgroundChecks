History
Founded in 2006,
[VoteVets.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoteVets.org) is organized as a non-partisan political action committee (PAC) and non-profit 501(c)(4) status in the United States. Although a nonpartisan organization, it has been described as “closely aligned with Congressional Democrats” and “liberal” in news stories. In a June 2011 press release, the organization specifically identified itself as the “largest progressive group of veterans in America.” The primary mission is to elect veterans into office.
