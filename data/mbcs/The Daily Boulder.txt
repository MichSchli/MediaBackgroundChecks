Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Boulder presents news with a left-wing bias through story selection that always favors the left. Quotations rather than hyperlinks generally source articles. Editorially, The Daily Boulder has a strong left-leaning bias with frequent use of strong emotional loaded words that favor the left and denigrate the right such as this
[“MAGA Rioter Whines He’s a ‘Political Prisoner,’ Blames Trump For His Legal Troubles](https://dailyboulder.com/maga-rioter-whines-hes-a-political-prisoner-blames-trump-for-his-legal-troubles/) and [“Trump’s Wild Theory Of How He’ll Be Reinstated As President Baffles NYT Reporter.”](https://dailyboulder.com/trumps-wild-theory-of-how-hell-be-reinstated-as-president-baffles-nyt-reporter/)
The Daily Boulder uses mainstream media outlets such as
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/) and [The Spectator](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-spectator-world-bias/) either by quoting or hyperlinking the source. Another example is [“Close Friend Of Trump Charged After Grabbing Woman By The ‘P—-‘: Report.”](https://dailyboulder.com/close-friend-of-trump-charged-after-grabbing-woman-by-the-p-report/) In this article, they use the Times-Tribune as its source and properly hyperlink. However, the title is sensationalized as the original source title is “Scranton dentist charged with groping patient.” The original article does not mention what parts were groped. In general, the Daily Boulder promotes a far-left perspective and sometimes is not factual.
