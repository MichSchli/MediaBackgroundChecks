Analysis / Bias
In review, the site features selected news stories about religion and op-eds from various news publications in addition to commentary from its own contributors. Though their own political views lean conservative, the site’s founders say their goal is to give readers “ideological diversity” in its commentary section. RealClearReligion frequently uses emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[Cancel Culture Is the Wrong Response to Deep Disagreement.](https://www.realclearreligion.org/articles/2020/09/04/cancel_culture_is_the_wrong_response_to_deep_disagreement_576372.html)
Generally, story selection moderately favors the Right and RealClearReligion takes a conservative stance. They typically source their information to credible sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), and the [Christian Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-post/); however, they also source factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/).
