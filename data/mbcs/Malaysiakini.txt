Analysis / Bias
In review, Malaysiakini uses loaded language in their headlines and articles such as “
[If the opposition is lying about 1MDB, sue them](https://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/416017)” and [“Setting a world benchmark in reclaiming democracy.”](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/424121) Malaysiakini tends to poorly source their articles regarding national politics by linking to themselves. They also utilize emotionally loaded language, which has an anti-government tone such as this from the above article: “millions turned up yesterday and overthrew a murderous, corrupt regime without shedding one drop of blood.” The main ruling party this was directed at is considered [center-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisan_Nasional).
When reporting international news, they demonstrate low bias and maintain factual reporting as they typically republish articles from credible sources such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
