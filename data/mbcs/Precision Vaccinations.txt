Analysis / Bias
In review, Precision Vaccinations “publishes
[vaccine news](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) based upon valid research from universities, government agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and the WHO.” Each article is reviewed by the clinical editorial board, which consists of a Physician, RN, and Pharmacist. Articles are presented with minimal bias, such as this: [Scotland’s HPV Vaccination Significantly Reduced Cervical Cancer](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/bivalent-hpv-vaccine-confirmed-being-highly-effective-reducing-incidence-cervical-cancer). This article is sourced to the distinguished [British Medical Journal (BMJ)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-bmj-british-medical-journal/), and other articles reviewed were also properly sourced to credible pro-science sources.
Precision Vaccinations also provides a
[fact-checking section](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/factcheck) where they look at common questions and statements and then research the facts. For example, this fact check: [Fact Check: Flu Vaccines Don’t Protect Children,](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/fact-check/fact-check-flu-vaccines-dont-protect-children) utilizes the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) as the basis for their conclusions.
