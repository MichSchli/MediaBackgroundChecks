Analysis / Bias
From our 2017 review: “They claim their views are Classical Liberal: a strong belief in free trade, limited government, and respect for human rights. In reviewing articles, I found a general left-center position with multiple articles criticizing President Trump. Outside the Beltway also criticizes
[climate change denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and respects human rights, which falls more in line with the political left. On the flip side, they have articles supporting the Citizen United decision based on their interpretation of the constitution. This aligns more with the political right.”
In 2021, our review has determined a similar perspective. For example, they report pro-science viewpoints such as this
[Another Study Rebuts The Claim That Vaccinations Cause Autism](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/another-study-rebuts-the-claim-that-vaccinations-cause-autism/). This story is properly and thoroughly sourced from credible outlets such as the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/). While they were not fans of former President Trump, they do report more favorably on Biden, especially as it relates to more free-market positions such as this [Biden’s ‘Promoting Competition’ Order](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/bidens-promoting-competition-order/). OTB generally promotes libertarian-leaning perspectives; however, most align more with the libertarian-left, especially related to social issues.
