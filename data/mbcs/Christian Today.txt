Analysis / Bias
In review, Christian Today reports news in the following sections, News, Church, Culture, Lifestyle, Comment, and Video from a pro-Christian perspective. Articles and headlines utilize minimal to moderate loaded language such as this:
[Abortion was the leading cause of death worldwide in 2019, ending the lives of over 42 million unborn babies](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/abortion-was-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide-in-2019-ending-the-lives-of-over-42-million-unborn-babies/133975.htm). This article is reasonably sourced to some credible outlets such as [Snopes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/snopes/); however, they also link to a far-right anti-abortion organization.
Editorially, Christian Today tends to align with the right on such positions as
[anti-abortion](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/abortion-was-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide-in-2019-ending-the-lives-of-over-42-million-unborn-babies/133975.htm), negative reporting on [LGBTQ](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/christian-school-governor-suspended-after-questioning-lgbt-reading-material/133423.htm), and support for [Boris Johnson’s Conservative administration.](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/christians-urged-to-pray-for-the-nations-leaders-after-general-election/133823.htm) However, they also promote some left-leaning positions, such as concern for [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/): [Climate crisis is ‘everybody’s problem’ – Rowan Williams](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/climate-crisis-is-everybodys-problem-rowan-williams/133915.htm). In general, more editorials lean right but provide occasional left-leaning perspectives.
