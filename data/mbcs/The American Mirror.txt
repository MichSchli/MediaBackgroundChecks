Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Mirror is a personal blog of Kyle Olsen that publishes consistently pro-right and anti-left information. Every article has a sensational headline that cannot be substantiated through evidence, such as this:
[WHAT’S WRONG WITH NANCY? Face spasms, slurred words mar brief Pelosi speech.](http://www.theamericanmirror.com/whats-wrong-with-nancy-face-spasms-slurred-words-mar-brief-pelosi-speech/) Generally, every story on this blog denigrates the left without a single reference to a counterpoint.
During the Covid-19 pandemic this source frequently published misinformation. In general, we rate them Far-Right biased and low factual.
