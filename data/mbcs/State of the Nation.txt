History
Founded in 2012, State of the Nation (formerly State of the Nation 2012) is a propaganda and conspiracy website that focuses on right-wing politics. According to their
[about page](http://stateofthenation.co/?page_id=2), “SOTN has no other interest except uncovering and presenting the facts. SOTN commentary provides a uniquely insightful perspective rarely found anywhere else in the alternative news media.”
The website completely lacks transparency as it does not name authors, editors, or owners.

Analysis / Bias
In review, State of the Nation does not write original content but instead links to other news sources, videos, social media, etc. They also republish news from other sources. Story selection comes from a far-right perspective, with many stories promoting conspiracy theories such as this
[Here’s the Raw Truth about the Covid-19 Vaccine. (Video)](http://stateofthenation.co/?p=50673). This video features [Anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) Dr. [Simone Gold](https://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29Q302), who has made numerous false claims regarding the Coronavirus. She was also [arrested](https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/simone-gold-capitol-riot-coronavirus/2021/01/12/d1d39e84-545f-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html?outputType=amp) for taking part in the Capitol riots on January 6th. They frequently use far-right questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) when it comes to sourcing.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and particular former President Trump, such as this
[Palm Beach County Harassing Trump, Chasing Him Out of Mar-a-Lago](http://stateofthenation.co/?p=50594). In general, SOTN is not a credible source of information as they routinely promote far-right conspiracies, propaganda, and pseudoscience.
