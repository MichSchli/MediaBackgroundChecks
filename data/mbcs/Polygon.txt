Analysis / Bias
In review, Polygon primarily reports on video game news and reviews. Headlines always reflect the content and use minimally loaded wording such as this:
[The man who made Wolfenstein](https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/12/24/21029936/castle-wolfenstein-silas-warner) and other stories consist of best-of lists, [The best Xbox One games](https://www.polygon.com/xbox-one/2018/10/5/17548210/best-xbox-one-games).
When determining bias on non-political websites, we use the search bar to look at names and specific issues to see if or how they reported on them. For example, a search for “Trump” pulls up an opinion piece that is negative towards former President Trump’s tariffs.
[Trump’s tariffs could ruin the American board game industry](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/5/18652411/trump-china-tariff-board-games). A search for “ [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/)” reveals this [PlayStation 5 will consume less power in effort to combat climate change](https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/23/20880051/ps5-low-power-suspend-mode-climate-change). A search for “ [Net Neutrality”](https://www.polygon.com/search?q=net+neutrality) reveals support, and finally, a search for “impeachment” demonstrates they have not reported on it. In general, when Polygon covers politics, it is in the context of their genre; however, story selection slightly favors the left.
