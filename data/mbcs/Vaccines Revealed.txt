History
Vaccines Revealed is a news and information website related specifically to the dangers of vaccines. Interestingly the people behind this website are
[chiropractors](http://www.vaccinesrevealed.com/about_us/), which, as far as I know, have nothing to do with the science of vaccinations. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, they have renamed the website “Covid Edition.” The website also redirects to a new domain in 2020: vrevealed.com.
The website lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page or disclose ownership or funding.
