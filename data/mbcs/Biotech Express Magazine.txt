Analysis / Bias
Biotech Express Magazine publishes news related to biotechnology. They claim all articles are peer-reviewed; however, they are not traditional as the
[editor determines](http://www.biotechexpressmag.com/biotech-express-peer-review-policy/) the reviewer. The magazine and website cover various topics related to biotechnology, such as this [Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi − Down To Earth Friends of Plants](http://www.biotechexpressmag.com/arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungi-%e2%88%92-down-to-earth-friends-of-plants/); however, the primary focus at this time appears to be the promotion of Covid-19 misinformation.
For example, in this
[piece](http://www.biotechexpressmag.com/unvaccinated-people-are-not-dangerous-vaccinated-people-are-dangerous-for-others-immunization-expert/), they claim that the vaccinated are dangerous to others where they state, “Vaccinated people should be put in quarantine, and should be isolated from the society.” We assume they refer to the [debunked claim](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-covid-19-vaccines-spike-protein-only-get-into-those-who-receive-it-no-shedding/) that the vaccinated shed spike proteins. This story is republished from the discredited [Americas Frontline Doctors](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/americas-frontline-doctors/), who frequently promote disinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines.
In another story, they conjure a conspiracy theory that Covid-19 cases in Africa started increasing due to media and pharma pressure
[COVID cases surges in Africa after anti covid group start questioning about low number of cases in Africa](http://www.biotechexpressmag.com/covid-cases-surges-in-africa-after-anti-covid-group-start-questioning-about-low-number-of-cases-in-africa/). While that may or may not be true, it is a baseless claim without evidence. Biotech Express Magazine generally promotes misinformation, conspiracy theories, and anti-covid-19 vaccine propaganda.
