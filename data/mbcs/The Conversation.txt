Analysis / Bias
In review, The Conversation is covered by a
[charter of editorial independence](https://theconversation.com/au/charter). The authors must be academics or researchers. Authors have final sign-off on their articles and complete statements that disclose potential conflicts.
The articles reviewed on the US Conversation website demonstrate the use of minimally loaded language such as this:
[Why the US has higher drug prices than other countries](https://theconversation.com/why-the-us-has-higher-drug-prices-than-other-countries-111256). Like most on The Conversation, this article is thoroughly sourced from credible educational and media outlets such as [Commonwealth Fund](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/commonwealth-fund/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), HHS.gov, and [Kaiser Health News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kaiser-family-foundation/).
In general, The Conversation covers a wide range of topics, most of which are evidence-based. Opinions expressed come from both the slightly left and slightly right, with more coming from a more liberal perspective.
