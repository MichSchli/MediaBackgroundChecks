Analysis / Bias
In review, Grit Post covers primarily political news with a left leaning bias in story selection. There is minimal to moderate use of loaded emotional language in headlines such as this:
[Trump Allegedly Inflated Net Worth By More Than $2 Billion to Get Loans from Deutsche Bank](https://gritpost.com/trump-net-worth-deutsche-bank/) and this [Gravel Champions Direct Democracy While States Undermine It](https://gritpost.com/gravel-champions-direct-democracy/). These two stories as well as all others reviewed utilize credible media sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/) and the [Orange County Register](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/orange-county-register/). The Grit Post also clearly labels news stories and opinion pieces accordingly. Editorially, this website is almost 100% in favor of the political left.
