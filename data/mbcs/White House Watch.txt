History
Founded in 2005, White House Watch was formerly known as the White House Briefing when it began as a part of WashingtonPost.com. The writer for White House Watch at that time was
[Dan Froomkin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Froomkin) who is a veteran liberal political journalist. In 2009, Dan Froomkin was [fired](https://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0609/Froomkin_out_at_Washington_Post.html?showall) by the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and was promptly hired by the [Huffington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/). In 2014, Froomkin left the Huffington Post and wrote for [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/) until 2017. Finally, in 2017 Dan Froomkin [re-launched](https://whitehousewatch.com/about-this-site/) White House Watch as an independent website/blog. According to their [about page](https://whitehousewatch.com/about-this-site/) the mission of White House Watch is:
- By relentlessly putting Trump’s incremental actions in their proper, alarming context as an ongoing, corrupt assault on pluralism, shared truths, and core liberal democratic values; and
- By convening an ongoing online dialogue about what we need to do once Trump is gone, with an emphasis on strengthening our democracy and curbing executive branch powers that have grown unchecked.

Analysis / Bias
In review, White House Watch (Dan Froomkin) writes almost exclusively about President Trump, often using strongly loaded emotional language that favors the left such as:
[Impeachment Watch: It’s not just about Trump, it’s about reining in the ‘preposterous power of the presidency](https://whitehousewatch.com/2018/12/impeachment-watch-its-not-just-about-trump-its-about-reining-in-the-preposterous-power-of-the-presidency/) and [George H.W. Bush was a horrible president, but Trump is the worst by far](https://whitehousewatch.com/2018/12/george-h-w-bush-was-a-horrible-president-but-trump-is-the-worst-by-far/). A review of sourcing for both of these stories shows solid sourcing, albeit to left-leaning sources such as [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), [Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) [Huff Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), and [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/). A review of other articles also shows a pattern of responsible sourcing. Despite proper sourcing, the use of loaded emotional wording is extreme, as evidenced by this quote from the latter article above: Trump’s uncouth and unvarnished expressions of racism and his barely disguised hatred of women have fed the darkest and most ignorant strains of American politics, empowering white nationalists and misogynists, readmitting language and sentiments into our political discourse that had gradually been disgraced, and generally reversing what had been American society’s reasonably steady movement in the direction of pluralistic enlightenment.”
In general, this is the personal blog of Dan Froomkin who presents highly charged liberal opinions that are based on factual news events. There isn’t a single story that can be found on this blog that reports anything positive or balanced toward the current administration. Unfortunately, these extreme opinions can be misleading to the reader even though they are sourced to accurate information.
