Analysis / Bias
OCCRP publishes articles sourced with quotes such as
[“Russian Asset Tracker”](https://cdn.occrp.org/projects/russian-asset-tracker/en/person/3/alisher-usmanov/?_gl=1%2a1y1tqgf%2a_ga%2aNTIwMjk1MjAwLjE2Nzc1ODUxNTc.%2a_ga_NHCZV5EYYY%2aMTY3NzU4NTE1Ni4xLjEuMTY3NzU5MzQ5MC42MC4wLjA.) a quote from the article reads, “A representative of Usmanov told OCCRP that he has never benefited from the Russian government nor from the privatization of state assets and that his capital was obtained solely through transparent investment and asset management.” This article does not contain any hyperlinks and does not name the representative, making it impossible to determine if it is credible.
Some articles, such as
[Sanctioning an Oligarch Is Not So Easy: Why the Money Trail of Alisher Usmanov, One of Russia’s Wealthiest Men, Is Difficult to Follow](https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/sanctioning-an-oligarch-is-not-so-easy-why-the-money-trail-of-alisher-usmanov-one-of-russias-wealthiest-men-is-difficult-to-follow) hyperlinks to credible sources such as [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/), treasury.gov, [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, they frequently report negatively on the former Trump administration, such as this
[‘Have a Nice Life’: Trump Exits With Pardons for Cronies, Money Launderers](https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13691-have-a-nice-life-trump-exits-with-pardons-for-cronies-money-launderers). On the other hand, they report favorably on the Biden administration like this [The U.S. Puts Global Anti-Corruption Efforts at Center of Foreign Policy](https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/14575-the-u-s-puts-global-anti-corruption-efforts-at-center-of-foreign-policy). Finally, OCCRP is currently focused on investigations and reporting on Russian corruption and crimes, such as this [Kremlin-Linked Group Arranged Payments to European Politicians to Support Russia’s Annexation of Crimea](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/kremlin-linked-group-arranged-payments-to-european-politicians-to-support-russias-annexation-of-crimea).
In general, the OCCRP holds a left-leaning editorial and advocacy bias. While the information appears fact-based, they sometimes do not use hyperlinks or name the source, which results in a Mostly Factual rating.
