Funded by / Ownership
Insider.co.uk may be owned by Reach plc, which
[closed](https://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/2022/05/reach-closes-scottish-business-insider-magazine/) the Scottish Business Insider magazine due to rising costs. It is unclear as Insider.co.uk mentions its contact as Reach plc, but the Reach plc website [does not list them](https://www.reachplc.com/about-us/our-brands) as one of its brands. The website now operates under [Insider Publications Limited](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/SC094795), a dormant company registered in Glasgow. However, the current operational management and ownership of Insider.co.uk are unclear. This lack of transparency regarding its current ownership structure presents a potential issue for understanding the website’s operational and editorial direction. Insider.co.uk is funded through advertising, partnerships, sponsorships, and affiliate commissions.

[“Yousaf says the UK is ‘poor man of northwest Europe,'”](https://www.insider.co.uk/news/yousaf-says-uk-poor-man-31834776) which reports on a speech by First Minister Humza Yousaf, focusing on his views about the UK’s economic status and the future of an independent Scotland.

Further, it avoids emotionally loaded language, maintaining a factual tone throughout.
Similarly, the article
[“Sarwar lays out plan to turn Scotland into a ‘manufacturing powerhouse'”](https://www.insider.co.uk/news/sarwar-lays-out-plan-turn-31321356) details Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar’s plans to transform Scotland’s manufacturing sector, as reported during his visit to the Harland and Wolff fabrication yard. The report focuses on Sarwar’s critique of current policies and his proposed strategies without apparent bias. It provides a platform for Sarwar’s views without interjecting with counterarguments or supportive editorial comments, maintaining a balanced presentation. Like the first article, this report is also free from emotionally loaded language, sticking to a straightforward reporting style.
