History
Policyed.org is a website that is affiliated with the
[Hoover Institution](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hoover-institution/), that covers US policy and promotes free-market capitalism. According to their [about page](https://www.policyed.org/about) “The digital media revolution has transformed the way people obtain information and form opinions. Countless partisan outlets peddle assertions and “sound bites” as indisputable facts. Few people have the knowledge and analytical skills to navigate this torrent of misinformation. They crave credible and accessible sources of facts, analysis, and information about proposed policies and the effects of those already enacted.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the purpose of the PolicyEd website is to educate the public on policies that they feel are detrimental to free-markets and liberty. In other words, it promotes a Libertarian perspective. The website frequently promotes the economic theories of Milton Friedman such as this
[MILTON FRIEDMAN EXPLAINS THE GREAT DEPRESSION](https://www.policyed.org/intellections/great-depression/video). Milton Friedman was an American economist who received the 1976 [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences) for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history, and theory, and the complexity of [stabilization policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilization_policy). In short, Friedman supported supply-side economics, with limited governmental regulation. He frequently criticized [Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics), and in his best-selling book Capitalism and Freedom, he [advocated policies](https://web.archive.org/web/20070103173849/http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/bios/Friedman.html) such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers and opposed the war on drugs. Most of which have become tenats of the Libertarian party.
The website breaks information into the following topics Civics, Economics, Environment, Health Care, and National Security. Under the environment section, they frequently discuss climate change; however, they do believe that
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is influenced by humans but prefer more free-market approaches as solutions. In general, the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning libertarian bias.
