Analysis / Bias
Covid Call to Humanity publishes content that frequently leans towards conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. An article titled
[“Alex Jones: Biden admin preparing to bring back full COVID restrictions, rollout to begin by September”](https://covidcalltohumanity.org/2023/08/19/alex-jones-biden-admin-preparing-to-bring-back-full-covid-restrictions-rollout-to-begin-by-september/) references conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and lacks credible sources to substantiate its claims. The article’s editor’s note suggests a “hidden agenda” behind governmental health measures, a narrative often not supported by evidence but common in conspiracy theories. As such, they claim only a select group, like Alex Jones and his followers, know the government’s “true” motives.
Another piece,
[“Biometric Digital ID Systems: A Path Towards Total Control,”](https://covidcalltohumanity.org/2023/08/25/biometric-digital-id-systems-a-path-towards-total-control/) critiques the MOSIP, a digital ID platform funded by the Gates Foundation, using emotionally loaded language to imply malevolent intentions behind digital IDs. This also aligns with a common feature of conspiracy theories, where only a select group (in this case, the author and like-minded individuals) are thought to be aware of the “true” motives behind widely accepted practices or technologies. The lack of credible sources to substantiate these claims further adds to its conspiratorial nature. The article cites “Fully Human” as its source, another website delving into transhumanism and “humanity’s quest for technological immortality.” The fact that the article relies on a source promoting alternative viewpoints and theories creates a self-referential information loop lacking external validation.
While the website occasionally cites credible sources, the interpretation and presentation of these sources often promote biased or conspiratorial viewpoints, which can be misleading for readers who may not go to the sources to see how they have been interpreted or skewed.
