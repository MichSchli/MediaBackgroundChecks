History
[Founded in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Eye), the Middle East Eye is a London-based website that publishes news and opinion on the Middle East. According to their [about page](https://www.middleeasteye.net/about-middle-east-eye), they claim, “We aim to be the primary portal of Middle East news, and our target audience are all those communities of readers living in and around the region that care deeply for its fate.” The current editor is David Hearst.

Funded by / Ownership
The Middle East Eye lacks transparency as it does not easily provide ownership information. The website requires that you find ownership information on their
[Terms and Conditions](https://www.middleeasteye.net/terms-and-conditions) page, which indicates M.E.E Ltd is the owner. The website also does not indicate that [Jamal Bessasso](https://companycheck.co.uk/director/924987112/MR-AYOUB-JAMAL-AWN-JAMAL-BESSASSO) is the owner of M.E.E Ltd. Finally, Middle East Eye does not state if they have donors, but we can confirm they use display advertising to generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Middle East Eye provides original news reporting and commentary on 22 Middle Eastern Countries. Articles and headlines use moderately loaded language such as this
[Covid-19: Palestinian Authority criticized for VIP vaccine distribution](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/covid-palestine-vaccine-nepotism-criticism). This story, like others reviewed, is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and local Middle Eastern Countries’ media.
Editorially, they often oppose Middle Eastern governments but often support Muslim organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood:
[Egyptian court sentences top Muslim Brotherhood leaders to life](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/covid-palestine-vaccine-nepotism-criticism) and this [The Muslim Brotherhood and Washington’s misguided Middle East policy](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/muslim-brotherhood-terrorist-designation-would-mark-another-us-foreign-policy-blunder). When reporting on the USA, they often hold negative views of the conservative right and, particularly former President Donald Trump such as this [US: New exhibition depicts ‘war on terror’ from Muslim eyes](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-exhibition-war-terror-muslim-communities). They also tend to report favorably on President Biden’s positions with Saudi Arabia [The ‘Biden doctrine’: How not talking to MBS could impact Saudi-US relations](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/saudi-us-biden-doctrine-mbs-new-dawn-relations). In general, they report news factually, with support for the Muslim Brotherhood; however, they often support left-leaning Democratic governments politically.
