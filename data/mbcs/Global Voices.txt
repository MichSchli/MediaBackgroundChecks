History
[Global Voices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Voices_(NGO)) launched in 2004, as a non-profit project started at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Global Voices is an international volunteer community of writers, bloggers and digital activists that aim to translate and report on what is being said in citizen media worldwide. Global Voices is founded by [Ethan Zuckerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Zuckerman) and [Rebecca MacKinnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon).
They state their
[mission](https://globalvoices.org/about/) as: “We work to find the most compelling and important stories coming from marginalized and misrepresented communities. We speak out against [online censorship](https://advox.globalvoices.org/) and support new ways [for people to gain access](https://rising.globalvoices.org/) to the Internet.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Global Voices presents news with minimal use of loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles such as “
[Trump’s Strategy for Afghanistan: New Hopes and Old Fears.”](https://globalvoices.org/2017/08/27/trumps-strategy-for-afghanistan-new-hopes-and-old-fears/) They typically utilize credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), .gov sources such as White House Archives, state.gov, and [Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/). [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) also gave Global Voices [unrestricted grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Voices_(NGO)) from 2006 to 2008. However, some articles utilize local sources of the region or country they are covering, which we have no way of verifying the credibility. Global Voices translates articles from 40 different languages, therefore it is not possible to check the credibility of each and every source they mention such as the sources mentioned [here](https://globalvoices.org/2017/11/25/russian-tv-backs-down-after-calling-armenian-hero-fascist-collaborator/), which are not all in English.
