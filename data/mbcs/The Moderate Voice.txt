[publishes political cartoons](http://themoderatevoice.com/cartoon-trumps-thanksgiving-pardon/) that lean left and mostly have an unfavorable view of former President Trump.
Similarly, a review of political articles also demonstrates that many more lean left. There is also the use of loaded emotional language that favors the left, such as this:
[Rick Scott- Corruption Rewarded.](http://themoderatevoice.com/rick-scott-corruption-rewarded/) Information is properly sourced from credible media or known quotes from prominent figures. Finally, story selection tends to favor the left, and although they claim to represent both sides, there is little evidence of right-leaning perspectives.
