Analysis / Bias
In review, The Jewish Voice (TJV) focuses on news from the USA and Israel, emphasizing a Jewish perspective. Articles and headlines contain emotionally loaded language, and the paper’s tone leans strongly right in its Israeli coverage. For example, this article supports the current right-wing prime minister: “
[Netanyahu blasts Lapid for ‘weakness, defeat, and surrender.”](https://thejewishvoice.com/2022/09/netanyahu-blasts-lapid-for-weakness-defeat-and-surrender/) According to [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), Yair Lapid is Israel’s former centrist [Prime Minister](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/09/yair-lapid-bibi-netanyahu-israel-extremism-centrism/671483/). In other articles, they are critical of the former centrist government: [“‘Shameful surrender’: Lapid blasted by Israeli right for touting Palestinian ‘terror’ state”](https://thejewishvoice.com/2022/09/shameful-surrender-lapid-blasted-by-israeli-right-for-touting-palestinian-terror-state/) and Democratic US President Joe Biden’s “ [Netanyahu Brushes Off Biden’s Call for “Significant De-Escalation in Fight.”](https://thejewishvoice.com/2021/05/netanyahu-brushes-off-bidens-call-for-significant-de-escalation-in-fight/)
Regarding coverage of the United States, they hold a pro-Trump and conservative bias through republishing stories from right-biased questionable sources such as
[The Epoch Times,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/) with stories like [“Trump Derangement Syndrome Is Going To Get Worse.”](https://thejewishvoice.com/2022/08/trump-derangement-syndrome-is-going-to-get-worse/) Other sources they utilize include Questionable [The Federalist ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/)and [World Net Daily (WND)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/). Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they have promoted misinformation related to vaccines (pseudoscience), such as this [Studies show blood damage in those who got COVID jab](https://thejewishvoice.com/2022/09/studies-show-blood-damage-in-those-who-got-covid-jab/). This claim is [misleading](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/byram-bridles-claim-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-toxic-fails-to-account-for-key-differences-between-the-spike-protein-produced-during-infection-and-vaccination-misrepresents-studies/) and unsupported by evidence.
Finally, the website promotes conspiracy theories from Pro-Trump

Numerous fact-checking outlets have [debunked](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/mypillow-ceos-video-rehashes-debunked-election-fraud-claims/) Mike Lindell’s election fraud conspiracies. In general, The Jewish Voice is Far-Right biased and frequently promotes conspiracy theories and right-wing propaganda that is not always factual.
