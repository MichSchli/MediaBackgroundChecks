Analysis / Bias
In review, Conservatives Today does not perform original reporting, but rather summarizes other conservative stories and adds emotionally loaded commentary such as
[this](https://conservativetoday.org/another-savage-fighter-and-tucker-carlson-favorite-just-joined-trumps-legal-team/) “Right now, media jackals, led by the traitors over at Fox News are “deciding” elections for the American people and claiming “fraud” isn’t an issue.” Headlines are also highly sensationalized to favor the right such as this [JUST IN: Sidney Powell – President Trump Already Released the Kraken – Claims Obama Was Involved (VIDEO).](https://conservativetoday.org/just-in-sidney-powell-president-trump-already-released-the-kraken-claims-obama-was-involved-video/) This story is sourced from Twitter.

Further, they frequently reference discredited sources such as [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/list/?category=&ruling=pants-fire&speaker=rudy-giuliani) who has a very poor track record with fact-checkers. In general, this is a source that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracies and propaganda.
