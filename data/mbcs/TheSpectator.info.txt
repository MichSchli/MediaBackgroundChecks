History
[Founded in December 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/thespectator.info), TheSpectator.info is a conservative imposter website using the same name as the credible [Spectator Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-spectator-uk/). The website’s description reads, “A conservative publication and syndicator with one aspiration to fulfill: a media platform where truth conquers all.”
The website completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page, author names, or bios and do not disclose ownership or funding.

Funded by / Ownership
TheSpectator.info lists The Spectator Media as their copyright, while their domain is registered to the
[Lauder Institute](https://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/), which is part of the prestigious Wharton School. This is fake information as there is no connection between this questionable website and this Ivy League school. Further, Spectator Media does not exist. Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, TheSpectator.info is a conservative imposter website that attempts to trick people into thinking they are the credible UK and US-based Spectator. News stories are often plagiarized from other sources through direct copy and pasting. For example, this story:
[The Latest Bidenbabble](https://thespectator.info/2020/04/17/the-latest-bidenbabble/) is copied and pasted from the factually Mixed [PowerlineBlog](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/power-line/) ( [THE LATEST BIDENBABBLE](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2020/04/the-latest-bidenbabble.php?tsize=large).) Although they credit Powerline, it is reproduced word for word without permission, which is copyright infringement. Another story, [Trump calls on states to ‘LIBERATE’ their people from coronavirus restrictions](https://thespectator.info/2020/04/17/trump-calls-on-states-to-liberate-their-people-from-coronavirus-restrictions/), is [blatantly plagiarized](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-liberate-states-economy-reopen?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20foxnews%2Fpolitics%20%28Internal%20-%20Politics%20-%20Text%29) from [Foxnews.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). We can assure you they did not get permission to republish this.
Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left such as this
[Immigration & Media: Elites Will Always Support Mass Immigration](https://thespectator.info/2020/04/16/immigration-media-elites-will-always-support-mass-immigration/). This story is [plagiarized](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/does-the-medias-hatred-of-trump-trump-its-devotion-to-mass-immigration/) from the credible [National Review](https://thespectator.info/2020/04/16/immigration-media-elites-will-always-support-mass-immigration/). Another source they frequently steal from is the Questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which has failed numerous fact checks. In general, this is a far-right fake imposter website.
