In review, the website publishes news about Crime, Politics, Health, Entertainment, Flashbacks, and Royals. We will focus on political news to evaluate bias. Inside Edition covers political news with minimal to moderately loaded headlines such as this:
[Did President Trump’s Allies Pressure School to Hide His Grades?](https://www.insideedition.com/did-president-trumps-allies-pressure-school-hide-his-grades-51217) This story is appropriately sourced to credible left-leaning sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). On the other hand, some headlines are more sensational: [Boy Sells Hot Chocolate to Help Build Trump’s Border Wall, Gets Called ‘Little Hitler](https://www.insideedition.com/boy-sells-hot-chocolate-help-build-trumps-border-wall-gets-called-little-hitler-50918).’ This video story is sourced through interviews.
