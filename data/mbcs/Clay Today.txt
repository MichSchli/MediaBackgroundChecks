Analysis / Bias
In review, Clay Today reports local news via journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Clay Community Transportation, Jacksonville Transportation Authority to host public meeting](https://www.claytodayonline.com/stories/clay-community-transportation-jacksonville-transportation-authority-to-host-public-meeting,50076?). National and International news comes directly from the [Associated Press.](https://www.theitem.com/stories/sumter-school-board-holding-called-meeting-tuesday-night,322683)
Editorially, op-eds cover both perspectives without extremes. In general, straight news reporting has a minimal bias, and editorially they are least biased.
