History
Launched in
[1944](https://librarytechnology.org/pr/25865), at the order of Charles de Gaulle, Le Monde is a daily newspaper based in Paris, France. The paper covers French current events, world news, economy, sports politics, and lifestyle. Le Monde’s editorial stance is considered Centre-Left.
Up until 2010, Le Monde was owned by journalists and employees who work there; however,
[in 2010](https://www.economist.com/newsbook/2010/06/28/le-monde-gets-a-new-owner), they ran into financial troubles, and it was acquired by Mathieu Pigasse (a Lazard partner), Xavier Niel (a telecom entrepreneur), and Pierre Bergé (former owner of Saint Laurent). In October 2018, [Pigasse sold 49%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/le-monde-journalists-warn-of-threat-to-editorial-independence) of his stake in the company to [Czech businessman Daniel Křetínský](https://mondaynote.com/the-cutthroat-battle-for-controlling-le-monde-9983d28f4119) who made his fortune from fossil fuels. Le Monde’s Independency Group, a minority shareholder, made up of journalists and (own 25 percent of its parent company) was not informed of this sale. In 2019 the journalists at Le Monde pressured Pigasse and Niel, which resulted in the signing of [the veto agreement](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/le_monde_daniel_kretinsky.php) called [“pole d’independance:](https://www.siasat.com/frances-le-monde-shareholders-sign-independence-peace-pact-1635322/) which gives a veto right to the minority shareholders over any change of shareholder control.

[“George Clooney’s lesson in inclusiveness in Los Angeles”](https://www.lemonde.fr/m-le-mag/article/2021/07/02/a-hollywood-la-lecon-d-inclusivite-de-george-clooney_6086729_4500055.html) and [“Women in struggle, a world struggle”](https://www.lemonde.fr/podcasts/article/2021/06/28/femmes-en-lutte-un-combat-mondial-un-nouveau-podcast-du-monde_6086071_5463015.html) (in partnership with The French Development Agency – Agence Française de Développement, AFD).

[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), supporting the widely-shared scientific consensus of global warming. Here is an editorial published by Le Monde upon the withdrawal of the Paris Accord by former president Donald Trump [“On climate change, an abdicationist America,”](https://www.lemonde.fr/climat/article/2017/06/02/le-monde-editorial-on-climate-change-an-abdicationist-america_5138084_1652612.html) and another article regarding climate activist [“Greta Thunberg: “People don’t want to hear bad news about the climate crisis anymore.”](https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2021/06/04/greta-thunberg-les-gens-ne-veulent-plus-entendre-de-mauvaises-nouvelles-sur-la-crise-climatique_6082916_3244.html)
In general, Le Monde publishes blog posts authored by Thomas Pickety regarding topics such as the rise in inequality
[“After the climate denial, the inequality denial”](https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2020/01/14/after-the-denial-of-climate-change-the-inequality-denial/) and [“The G7 legalizes the right to defraud.”](https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/category/in-english/) These articles are properly sourced through hyperlinking to credible outlets such as [Propublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), and [taxjusticenow.org](https://taxjusticenow.org). They also republish [articles](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2021/07/03/francois-fillon-rejoint-le-conseil-d-administration-d-un-groupe-petrolier-detenu-par-l-etat-russe_6086851_3210.html) from the newswire service [AFP.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/)
In general, they report factually and use a wide variety of credible sources, however editorially, they promote liberal positions on most issues and lean left.
