History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/thecoloradoherald.com), The Colorado Herald anonymously runs a conspiracy website with a domain registered in Iceland. The website can also be classified as an imposter site because it looks like an online Colorado Newspaper. An [about page](https://thecoloradoherald.com/about/) describes the site as “The Colorado Herald is aptly named for our collective ability to loudly convey the correct message, not the message often crafted, contrived, and manipulated by mainstream media. This website really came to fruition during the alarming government overreach known as a pandemic, amidst the most damaging political influences of a generation or better.”

[Insurrection Act declared Saturday night?](https://thecoloradoherald.com/2021/insurrection-act-declared-saturday-night/) While the Colorado Herald is correct to point out there is no evidence this occurred, why bother publishing such a nonsensical headline, to begin with? When reporting on Covid-19, they promote misinformation such as this [Fact checked: COVID-19 vaccine is unapproved gene therapy](https://thecoloradoherald.com/2021/fact-checked-covid-19-vaccine-is-unapproved-gene-therapy/). This is [false](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-vaccine-code-idUSKBN2AI2ZC) as the Covid vaccine is not gene therapy. In another story, [Why the delta variant is pseudo-science and propaganda,](https://thecoloradoherald.com/2021/why-the-delta-variant-is-pseudo-science-and-propaganda/) they cite questionable sources such as [LifeSiteNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/), which frequently promotes misinformation.
