History
[Founded in 2015](http://whois.domaintools.com/ahtribune.com), the American Herald Tribune is an online independent news source. According to their [about page](https://ahtribune.com/about.html), “AHTribune is dedicated to strengthening and supporting independent journalism, and to improving the public’s access to independent information sources. AHTribune aims to inspire action and advocacy on the human rights, social justice, media, spirituality and religion, contemporary history, youth issues and more.” The [editor](https://ahtribune.com/author.html?id=874) of the website is Dr. Tony Hall, who has espoused numerous conspiracy theories. See the analysis below for details.
On 1/24/2020, CNN reported that the American Herald Tribune might originate in Iran:
[Exclusive: This site pays Americans to write ‘news’ articles. Signs indicate it originates in Iran](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/tech/iran-info-ops/index.html). Although it seems likely this is an Iranian website, there is not enough concrete evidence to change the country designation from “unknown.” Just keep in mind this may be an Iranian propaganda site.
On November 4, 2020, the website was seized by the FBI.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the American Herald Tribune features a wide variety of writers from diverse backgrounds. The central theme of the website is human rights. Most articles do not utilize loaded language, and many are appropriately sourced. Sounds good, right? That is only part of the story. As I mentioned, there is a wide variety of writers, some of which are conspiracy theorists. For example, Tony Hall has penned many controversial stories that fall within the conspiracy genre. Dr. Hall has promoted the use of false flags as seen here:
[The Trudeau Government and False Flag Terrorism in Canada](https://ahtribune.com/world/americas/2172-trudeau-false-flag-terrorism-in-canada.html) and promotion that [9/11 was an inside job.](https://ahtribune.com/world/americas/675-canadian-government.html) In [this article](https://ahtribune.com/culture-media/1992-deep-state-social-media.html) written by David Steele, there is the promotion of the deep state conspiracy and highly negative speech directed at Israel and Jews. This author also has appeared on conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones’s Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) program.

While many articles on this website are credible, there are just as many in the tinfoil hat realm of conspiracy theories.
