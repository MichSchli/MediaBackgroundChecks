History
The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) is a Washington, D.C. based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[founded in 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_a_Constructive_Tomorrow) that advocates for free-market solutions to environmental issues. According to their [about page](https://www.cfact.org/about/), “Its co-founders, David Rothbard and Craig Rucker, strongly believed the power of the market combined with the applications of safe technologies could offer humanity practical solutions to many of the world’s most pressing concerns.”
CFACT also publishes the
[Climate Depot](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-depot/), which we have rated as a climate change-denying pseudoscience website. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
CFACT is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization mostly funded through the
[Donor’s Trust](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/14/donors-trust-funding-climate-denial-networks). The [purpose](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/3/3/inside-donorstrust-what-this-mission-driven-daf-offers-phila.html) of the Donor’s Trust Fund is to “safeguard the intent of libertarian and conservative donors.” In other words, it allows anti-climate change advocates to donate anonymously. In the past, CFACT received over $500,000 from [Exxon-Mobil](https://exxonsecrets.org/html/orgfactsheet.php?id=25).
Analysis / Bias
In review, CFACT publishes news and information about limited government, deregulation, and
[human-influenced climate change denialism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Headlines often contain emotional wording such as this: [Petitioning against climate alarmism goes global](https://www.cfact.org/2019/08/20/petitioning-against-climate-alarmism-goes-global/). Although this story has many data points of information, there is not a single source cited to validate the claims. In another article titled [Will Al Gore be the first fake meat billionaire?](https://www.cfact.org/2019/08/21/will-al-gore-be-the-first-fake-meat-billionaire/) The author produces an opinion piece that sources the Questionable Climate Depot.
In 2016, CFACT published the
[Climate Truth File](https://web.archive.org/web/20161103191014/https://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CFACT-Climate-Truth-File-2016.pdf), essentially a manifesto attempting to refute human-influenced global warming. Here are some of their main points:
- According to satellite data, global temperatures have been virtually flat for about 18 years, and peer-reviewed literature is now scaling back predictions of future warming.
- Despite claims of snow being ‘a thing of the past,’ cold season snowfall has been rising.
- Sea level rise rates have been steady for over a century, with recent deceleration.
- A 2015 NASA study found Antarctica was NOT losing ice mass and ‘not currently contributing to sea-level rise.
- 2016 Arctic sea ice was 22% greater than the recent low point of 2012.
- The Arctic sea ice is now in a 10-year ‘pause’ with ‘no significant change in the past decade’
- Polar bears are doing fine, with their numbers way up since the 1960s.
Most of this information is either
[false or misleading](https://www.factcheck.org/2015/12/climate-change-review/). For example, stating that sea ice is 22% greater from its all-time low does not change the fact that it is down close to 40% from 1979, when satellite images were first used. This chart from [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/) illustrates the fallacy that arctic sea ice is not decreasing.
