History
According to its
[“About Us”](https://www.opindia.com/about/) page, OpIndia was founded in December [2014](https://www.opindia.com/2014/12/news-and-current-affairs-website-opindia-com-launched/) by Kunal Kamal and an initial team that is no longer active. The website, now led by Editor-in-Chief Nupur J Sharma, publishes opinion articles, news reports, issue analyses, and fact-check articles. Based in New Delhi, OpIndia also offers content in Hindi and Gujarati through separate teams.

Analysis / Bias
When covering Indian national news, OpIndia tends to be critical of left-leaning opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. OpIndia features a section called
[“Rahul Gandhi lies,”](https://www.opindia.com/2023/06/rahul-gandhi-think-tanks-hudson-university-sunita-vishwanath-iamc-george-soros-usa-tour/) which scrutinizes Rahul Gandhi’s statements and actions across various topics.
An article titled
[“Rahul Gandhi in USA: Hudson Institute, Sunita Vishwanath and the dangerous Islamist George Soros, and anti-India links. A deep-dive analysis.”](https://www.opindia.com/2023/06/rahul-gandhi-think-tanks-hudson-university-sunita-vishwanath-iamc-george-soros-usa-tour/) presents a negative portrayal of the politician and displays a strong right-wing bias. The language used (“dangerous Islamist,” “anti-Hindu, anti-India propaganda”) is emotionally charged and intended to provoke reactions. Sources cited include [The Hindu](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hindu/#google_vignette), [Times of India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-india/), and social media posts, but the article discredits Gandhi and the organizations he is linked to. It insinuates that he is part of a Soros-led agenda to undermine India, playing into existing conspiracy theories.
OpIndia’s coverage of PM Modi is positive, emphasizing his achievements and leadership without critical scrutiny, which contrasts with its critical stance towards opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, as seen in their article titled: “
[Freedom Fighters, governance, and Temple of Democracy: Highlights of PM Modi’s historic speech during last sitting at Old Parliament.”](https://www.opindia.com/2023/09/pm-modi-last-address-old-parliament-building/) In general, OpIndia holds right-leaning biases in favor of the conservative government and is not always factual based on failed fact checks.
