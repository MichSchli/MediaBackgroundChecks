According to their [about page](https://sciencevibe.com/sample-page/), they state “ScienceVibe educates, entertains, engages and enlightens. From scientific breakthroughs to the bizarre, fascinating and seemingly impossible!”
Science Vibe does not disclose who owns the website or edits the stories. In other words, they completely lack transparency.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Science Vibe publishes a combination of credible science news stories such as this
[New Zealand Bans People From Swimming With Dolphins](https://sciencevibe.com/2019/09/04/new-zealand-bans-swimming-with-dolphins/) to the absurd such as this [Is Earth a “Alien” Prison Planet?](http://sciencevibe.com/2017/03/15/is-earth-a-alien-prison-planet/)
The website frequently covers
[UFO sightings](https://sciencevibe.com/2018/07/30/watch-the-most-incredible-ufo-sightings-of-april-2018-video/) as well as promotes highly misleading stories. For example, in this story, [Fatal Rooster Attack Kills 76 Year Old Woman](https://sciencevibe.com/2019/09/07/fatal-rooster-attack-kills-76-year-old-woman/), which is [true](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/04/woman-pecked-death-rooster-australia/2207730001/), they use an obviously Photoshopped image of a YOUNG woman laying in a pool of blood. This is very poor quality Photoshopping at that. See below.
