Analysis / Bias
Cell Systems Journal is a hybrid (some open-access) journal that publishes information and research on Systems Biology. The journal primarily publishes research such as this:
[Reproducibility metrics for context-specific CRISPR screens](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(23)00110-2).
Cell Press is an open-access/hybrid publisher of scientific journals. There are two types of Open Access Journals, legitimate and predatory, both of which charge the author for publication.
[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Cell Systems Journal is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, Cell Press has been criticized for [retracting some studies.](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cell/)
Although Cell Press has retracted some studies in other publications, Cell Systems Journal publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
