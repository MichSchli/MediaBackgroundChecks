In review, The Macon Telegraph covers local news via staff journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Man arrested after shooting at Dublin YKK plant leaves victim hospitalized](https://www.macon.com/news/local/article233107245.html). National and world news comes from [McClatchy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mcclatchydc/) publications and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they provide a reasonable balance of opinions with both the right-center and left-center represented. In general, news reporting is always factual, and editorials not extreme in either direction.
