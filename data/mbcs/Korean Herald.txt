Analysis / Bias
The Korea Herald often uses loaded words in their headlines that are charged with emotion, such as
[Putin negative on sanctions](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170907000525). When reporting stories about the USA, there is a left-center bias, such as this: [Trump risk](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170503000114). However, when reporting South Korean national news, there is a right-center bias. Unfortunately, they rarely provide links to their sources, making it difficult to verify the context and accuracy of stories. International news is typically covered by the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) On the bias scale, they are difficult to rate, but our analysis puts them just right of center and reasonably factual.
