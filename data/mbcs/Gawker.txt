History
[Launched in 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker), Gawker is an American website covering celebrities and the media industry. Gawker was shut down in 2016 after filing bankruptcy due to a lawsuit filed by Hulk Hogan for publishing a sex tape featuring [Hulk Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan), which led Hogan to [sue the company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollea_v._Gawker) for invasion of privacy. Hogan was awarded 140 million dollars, putting an end to Gawker.
On July 12, 2018, Bryan Goldberg, owner of
[Bustle](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bustle-magazine/) and [Elite Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/elite-daily/), purchased Gawker.com in bankruptcy.

Analysis / Bias
Gawker publishes news stories in these categories: politics, celebrity, culture, media, money, tech, Chrissy Teigen, and gossip. The website combines original reporting along with republished articles from other Bustle properties. Articles and headlines frequently feature emotionally sensationalized headlines such as this
[LORI LIGHTFOOT: I HAVE THE BIGGEST DICK IN CHICAGO](https://www.gawker.com/politics/lori-lightfoot-i-have-the-biggest-dick-in-chicago). When it comes to sourcing information, they typically use credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and local media outlets, but sometimes other sensationalized sources like the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/).
The previous incarnation of Gawker was known for outing celebrities and sharing damaging gossip that many times proved to be true. This was also their downfall as they outed a
[billionaire](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/business/media/gawker-return.html) (Peter Thiel), who helped fund Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit, resulting in Gawker’s bankruptcy. The new Gawker covers the same topics and offers outrageous stories; however, it is clear they are more restrained and shying away from controversies and lawsuits.
Editorially, Gawker reports negatively on conservatives such as this
[TUCKER CARLSON MAKING THIS FACE](https://www.gawker.com/politics/tucker-carlson-making-that-face). A quote from the article reads, “Fox News personality and Putinista Tucker Carlson is one of them.” In another article, they again criticize conservatives [CPAC WAS THE WORST STAND-UP SHOW I’VE EVER BEEN TO](https://www.gawker.com/politics/cpac-was-the-worst-stand-up-show-ive-ever-been-to). They also take shots at Joe Biden, but they generally humor him vs. harsh criticism such as this [BIDEN GO VROOM](https://www.gawker.com/politics/president-joe-biden-go-vroom-electric-hummer-ride-general-motors-factory-zero-detroit).
Although Gawker’s content is sensationalized, they have not failed a fact check since relaunching in 2021; however, for this reason, we will not rate them Questionable at this time but rate them left-biased and Mostly Factual in reporting.
