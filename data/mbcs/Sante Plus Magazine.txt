Analysis / Bias
Sante Plus Magazine publishes health and wellness news stories geared toward a female audience. They divide information into topics such as Medicine, Nutrition & Recipes, Fitness & Well Being, Beauty & Care, Psycho & Sexuality, Stay Young, Mom & Kids, and Grandma Tips. Articles and headlines are often sensationalized, such as this
[After her condition is deemed hopeless, doctors decide to unplug this mom, and nothing can console her family](https://www.santeplusmag.com/apres-que-son-etat-soit-jugee-sans-espoir-les-medecins-decident-de-debrancher-cette-maman-et-rien-ne-peut-consoler-sa-famille/). Many articles are poorly sourced.
Sante Plus frequently promotes pseudoscience ranging from generally harmless Astrology to the dangerous promotion of unproven cancer cures. Here’s

They also promote miracle results from alkaline foods such as these [15 alkaline foods that protect against obesity, cancer, and heart disease](https://web.archive.org/web/20200110013127/https://www.santeplusmag.com/15-aliments-alcalins-qui-protegent-de-lobesite-du-cancer-et-des-maladies-cardiaques/). There is [zero scientific evidence](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/features/Pages/2019-05-06-pHear-pHactor-debunking-the-alkaline-diet.aspx) to support the benefits of an alkaline diet.

However, at the end of the article, they disclaim, “This list of natural ingredients does not in any way replace medical advice. It is essential to consult your doctor in order to assess your state of health and determine the most appropriate treatment.” The disclaimer placed at the bottom of the article may be misleading for people who read just the headlines or do not finish the entire article. In general, Sante Plus Magazine is a quackery-level pseudoscience website.
