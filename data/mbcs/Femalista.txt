Analysis / Bias
In review, Femalista breaks news into categories such as Women, Activism, Beauty & Health, Body & Love, LGBT, Parenting, and Politics. Story selection favors a liberal perspective and utilizes moderately loaded emotional wording such as this
[Judge Rules Women’s Soccer Can Continue Earning Less Than Men, Even If They Do More Work](https://www.femalista.com/judge-rules-womens-soccer-can-continue-earning-less-than-men-even-if-they-do-more-work/). This story, like most, is published by the anonymous WRN Editor and is sourced to a Twitter video. A review of several articles indicates they do not source information properly.
Editorially, Femalista leans strongly left, advocating for LGBT and women’s rights and holding pro-choice positions such as this

Further, they reject racism, [How Racism In US Health System Hinders Care And Costs Lives Of African Americans](https://www.femalista.com/how-racism-in-us-health-system-hinders-care-and-costs-lives-of-african-americans/), and promote concern for human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) [Guy Argues That “Social Justice Warriors” Can’t Prove Global Warming Is Real, Gets Destroyed By Facts](https://www.femalista.com/guy-argues-that-social-justice-warriors-cant-prove-global-warming-is-real-gets-destroyed-by-facts/). Finally, they often report negatively on Conservatives and President Trump, such as this [8-Year-Old Girl Scaled President Trump’s “Virtually Impenetrable” Border Wall](https://www.femalista.com/8-year-old-girl-scaled-president-trumps-virtually-impenetrable-border-wall/). In general, story selection almost always favors the left, and while most stories are factual, it is difficult to prove the veracity of claims due to poor sourcing.
