Analysis / Bias
Kremlin.ru is a government-run website, and as such, it primarily publishes content that aligns with the interests of the Russian government. The website provides updates on the activities of the President, including meetings, speeches, and policy decisions. For example, in the
[“Answer to a Journalist’s Question about the Situation at the Front”](http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71474) event, Putin claimed that 923 Ukrainian tanks and armored vehicles were “nailed” in 2 weeks. This claim was found [false](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-falsely-claims-923-ukrainian-tanks-and-armored-vehicles-nailed-in-2-weeks-/7149749.html) by fact-checkers. In another instance, during [“Press statements by the President of Russia and President of China](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/70750#sel=25:11:UjF,25:58:FX3),” Putin’s statement that the UN Charter guides Russia has been debunked as [false](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-falsely-claims-russia-guided-by-the-un-charter-/7020002.html). The website does not provide hyperlinks to external sources, making verifying the information difficult.
In general, Kremlin.ru publishes factual news about the schedule of President Putin; however, it also frequently promotes one-sided propaganda favorable to the Russian government and the President, as well as Putin’s false and misleading claims.
Failed Fact Checks
[Putin Ordered a Withdrawal of Russia’s Military in Syria.](https://www.polygraph.info/a/putin-russian-troops-syria/6741706.html)– False [“Russia and China insist that the United States, as the only state party to the Convention that has not completed the process of destroying chemical weapons, accelerate the elimination of its chemical weapons stockpiles.”](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-xi-putin/6743271.html)– Misleading [“Is the situation with the Donetsk Republic and the Luhansk Republic not the same? It is the same.”](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-is-wrong-ukraines-donbas-is-not-like-kosovo/6755653.html)– False [“Not a single country in the world has hypersonic weapons, let alone hypersonic weapons of intercontinental range.”](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-hypersonic-russia/6742293.html)– Misleading [“The regular strikes on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant by the Ukrainian military create the danger of a major nuclear disaster that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories.”](https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-putin-s-patently-bogus-claim-about-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-/6743463.html)– False
In conclusion, we rate Kremlin.ru as Right-Center Biased and Questionable based on government ownership and control of the website, the promotion of one-sided propaganda that does not offer balanced viewpoints, poor sourcing, and numerous misleading claims and failed fact checks. This source will change bias with each new administration. (M. Huitsing 07/22/2023)
