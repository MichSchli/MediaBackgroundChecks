[Mitch Pearlstein](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/50127/1/pearlsteinMitchell.pdf) is an author who served two years at the US Department of Education under President Ronald Reagan.

It not only researches and produces papers on Minnesota’s economy, education, health care, the family, employee freedom, and state and local governance. It also crafts and proposes creative solutions that emphasize free enterprise, limited government, personal responsibility, and government accountability.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

The website also features articles written by staff members that appear in other publications, such as [The Hill: The Blackouts Have Only Just Begun](https://www.americanexperiment.org/2021/02/the-hill-the-blackouts-have-only-just-begun/).
Editorially, research and stories favor a right-leaning conservative perspective. Scientifically, they do not
[deny human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); however, they frequently minimize the impacts of climate change and favor free-market solutions such as this [Teachers’ union encourages English teachers to promote political agenda around climate change](https://www.americanexperiment.org/2019/12/national-teachers-union-encourages-english-teachers-to-promote-political-agenda-around-climate-change/). When reporting on Covid-19, they tend to promote the harm caused by lockdowns rather than the harm of the disease, such as this [Covid-19 recession will cause 59,000 deaths annually for the next 15 years](https://www.americanexperiment.org/2021/01/covid-19-recession-will-cause-deaths-annually-for-next-15-years/). Finally, the Center of the American Experiment frequently reports positively on former President Trump while denigrating the left, such as this [In the Tank: Liberals Ungrateful Under the Trump Administration](https://www.americanexperiment.org/2020/11/in-the-tank-liberals-ungrateful-under-the-trump-administration/). This story is a podcast conducted with the climate change denial organization [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/). In general, the news reporting is mostly factual with a right editorial bias; however, some information pertaining to science is misleading.
