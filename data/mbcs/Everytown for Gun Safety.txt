According to their [about page](https://everytownresearch.org/about/), “Everytown for Gun Safety seeks to improve our understanding of the causes of gun violence and the means to reduce it – by conducting groundbreaking original research, developing evidence-based policies, and communicating this knowledge in the courts and the court of public opinion.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Everytown for Gun Safety is an organization that advocates for gun safety through stronger background checks, prohibiting domestic abusers from obtaining firearms, and holding the gun industry accountable. The website presents fact sheets under different categories that highlight their reasoning. For example, under the stronger background checks category, they report
[Background Checks Save Lives and Protect Our Communities](https://everytownresearch.org/background-checks-save-lives-protect-communities/). This fact sheet is well researched and thoroughly sourced from credible medical journals and university studies.
According to the right-leaning
[Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/) (The right’s version of [Sourcewatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/)), Everytown is a [lobbying group](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/everytown-for-gun-safety/) that has been criticized for playing “loose with the facts.” They sight several examples of criticism from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/fact-check-parkland-gun-violence-mental-illness.html), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/04/16/bloomberg-aims-to-spend-50-million-on-gun-control/?utm_term=.32c88356e287), [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/17/bloomberg-backed-gun-control-group-slammed-inflati/), and [Washington Examiner](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/no-there-have-not-been-18-school-shootings-so-far-in-2018/article/2649183). One example of this criticism is how Everytown calculates school shootings. Everytown counts a school shooting as “any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.” This includes security officers’ accidental discharges or other accidental incidents that did not result in injuries. [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/) has rated their calculation method [Mostly False](https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/15/jeff-greenfield/mostly-false-18-us-school-shootings-so-far-2018-an/).
In general, Everytown publishes news and research that supports gun control to increase safety. While they most often properly source their information, their methodology for calculating gun-related events has been criticized as being exaggerated or simply not accurate.
