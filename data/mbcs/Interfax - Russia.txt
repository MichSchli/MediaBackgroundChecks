Analysis / Bias
Interfax -Russia is a news agency providing national Russian and international news. Articles and headlines are minimally biased in wording like this
[US to provide $200 million more military aid to Ukraine](https://www.interfax.ru/world/827840). This report is properly sourced from [Whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/). The agency is currently reporting on the Russia-Ukraine war or, as they call it, a “Russian Military Operation” with a pro-Russian government perspective such as this [Russia proposed 10 humanitarian corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkov, Mariupol](https://www.interfax.ru/world/827847).
Editorially, Interfax – Russia does not publish opinion pieces; however, story selection is often favorable to the Russian government and President Putin
[The Taliban welcomed Putin’s words about their possible exclusion from the list of terrorists](https://www.interfax.ru/world/799288). While Interfax’s reporting appears low-biased, they strongly favor the Russian government by rarely offering criticism and omitting negative reports toward Russia.
