History
Anti-Fascist News is a news and opinion blog with a left wing bias through reporting and political affiliation. According to their
[about page](https://antifascistnews.net/about/) “Anti-Fascist news was birthed out of organizers and writers who care about anti-fascist and anti-racist struggle as an important area for radical and left politics. As we enter into periods of capitalist crisis, the rise of the far-right will continue to be a threat, and we intend to provide news and analysis that can be useful to organizers and anti-racists.”
There isn’t any information regarding a founder of the website, though they do disclose authors of articles, which appear to be citizen journalists.

Funded by / Ownership
Anti-Fascist News does not disclose ownership and there does not appear to be a source for funding as there isn’t advertising nor a donation link to be found on the website.
Analysis / Bias
In reviewing their articles, I found minimal use of loaded words and all articles were properly sourced. The reporting is left biased in that the entire purpose of the website is to oppose the Alt-Right. Based on the lack of information regarding who owns the site and who the primary editor/writer is we have no choice but to rank this source Mixed for factual reporting as we have no way to verify them even though the information may be rooted in fact.
