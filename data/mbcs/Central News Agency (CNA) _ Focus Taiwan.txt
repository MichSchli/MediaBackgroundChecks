History
Founded in Guangzhou, China, on April 1, 1924, the
[Central News Agency (CNA)](http://focustaiwan.tw/aboutus.aspx) is Taiwan’s state-run national news agency, and it is operated by the Chinese government. Focus Taiwan is the English-language news website of the Central News Agency (CNA). According to their [about page](http://focustaiwan.tw/aboutus.aspx), in 1996, after the Legislative Yuan passed a law, CNA reorganized and became a nonprofit corporation.
CNA focuses on news, politics, sports, entertainment, business, and technology. Currently, the CNA President is Chang Jui-chang, and the CNA Chairman is
[Liu Ka-shiang](https://www.ocacnews.net/overseascommunity/article/article_story.jsp?id=222097), a writer, nature observer, and veteran journalist. CNA is based in Taipei, Taiwan. cna.com.tw is the domain for the Central News Agency. [Read our profile on Taiwan media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/taiwan-roc-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Central News Agency’s (CNA) overseeing authority is the Taiwanese Ministry of Culture which appoints the chairman and the board. According to an
[article published](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2019/10/07/2003723487) in 2013 by the [Taipei Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/taipei-times/), “The CNA (Central News Agency) and the PTS (Public Television Service) receive about NT$300 million and NT$900 million (US $9.9 million and US $29.9 million) in government funding each year respectively.”
In 2018, Culture Minister Cheng Li-chiun
[announced](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201801240035.aspx) that Public Television Service (PTS), Central News Agency (CNA), Radio Taiwan International (RTI), and Chinese Television System (CTS) would all be merged into one “media group.” They further report, “The new organization will also require substantial and sustainable funding from a public media development fund, potentially a mix of public, self-raised and private investment, which will eventually remove government funding.” Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
Currently, the President of Taiwan is
[Tsai Ing-wen](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/30/asia-pacific/politics-diplomacy-asia-pacific/taiwan-tsai-ing-wen-win-election-2020-presidential-poll/#.XfULXWRKiUk), a member of the center-left Democratic Progressive Party and the first woman to be elected to the office.
In review, CNA publishes articles with neutral language, such as
[“President Tsai unveils growth roadmap for southern Taiwan](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201912140014.aspx),” and reports with balance, representing both sides. For example, in the same article, they also publish the opposition KMT (Center-Right) presidential candidate Daniel Han Kuo-yu’s view, who is running against President Tsai Ing-wen. In another article that reports on same-sex marriage, little bias is present: [“Taiwan records almost 1,200 gay marriages, 2 divorces since May 24”.

However, articles often do not contain hyperlinks. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the former Trump admin with a neutral tone, such as in this: [“Trump approves F-16 sale to Taiwan.”](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201908190006.aspx)Scientifically, CNA is generally pro-science with news stories [concerned](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/)about [climate change](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201912110019.aspx).
