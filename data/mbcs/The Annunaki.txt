History
[Annunaki.org](https://www.annunaki.org/) delves into the ancient astronaut theory, suggesting that the Sumerian gods, or Annunaki, were extraterrestrial beings who visited Earth in ancient times. The Ancient Aliens theory, popularized by authors like Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin, suggests that extraterrestrials visited Earth in ancient times and influenced human civilizations. While these ideas have a popular following, they lack empirical evidence and are not supported by mainstream archaeology or history. The website explores various topics related to the Annunaki, ancient civilizations, reptilians, and extraterrestrial theories.
The website lacks transparency as they do not have an About page.

Analysis / Bias
Annunaki.org promotes the idea that ancient civilizations had contact with extraterrestrial beings, specifically the Annunaki, a group of deities. The claims are speculative and lack empirical evidence.
For example, the article
[ “Pleiadians: The Nordic Aliens”](https://www.annunaki.org/pleiadians-nordic-aliens/) discusses the supposed existence of humanoid extraterrestrials from the Pleiades star cluster, presenting this as a factual account without empirical evidence.
Another article,
[ “Who Are the Reptilians?”](https://www.annunaki.org/who-are-the-reptilians/) claims that reptilian extraterrestrials have influenced human history without empirical support. The article provides a list of celebrities and political figures who are allegedly reptilian shapeshifters. Some names include Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga. Such claims are not supported by mainstream archaeology or history. The website often lacks credible sourcing, relying on interpretations of ancient texts and speculative theories.
In general, Annunaki.org combines elements of ancient history with speculative theories about extraterrestrials, all without the backing of empirical evidence or mainstream academic consensus. As such, it falls into the conspiracy-pseudoscience category.
