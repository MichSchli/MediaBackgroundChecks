Analysis / Bias
In review, Jacobin is a well-written quarterly magazine and website that publishes news from a strongly left-leaning perspective. There is moderate to strong use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez Pick a Fight With the Loan Sharks](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/05/bernie-sanders-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-payday-lenders-interest-rates). This article, like most on Jacobin, is properly sourced from a variety of High factual sources. Although Jacobin harshly criticizes former President Trump, they also frequently criticize centrist Democrats, often described as corporate and establishment Democrats: [Trump’s Sadism — and Democrats’ Accomodationism](https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/donald-trump-border-immigration-speech-democrats). Again, this article may contain loaded language, but it is properly sourced from only High factual sources. Editorially, all stories favor the Democratic Socialist left.
Jacobin has received praise from notable figures such as
[Noam Chomsky](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-voice-of-the-american-left/article8433549.ece), who states they are “a bright light in dark times.” They have also [faced criticism](https://reason.com/2016/07/14/fun-hating-socialist-magazine-jacobin-sa/) from free-market advocates, [Reason Magazine.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/)
