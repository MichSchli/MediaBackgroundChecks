Analysis / Bias
Sojourners covers politics, Christianity, culture, social justice, and the environment. Articles and headlines often hold a Christian-Left bias and utilize loaded emotional language such as this
[U.S. POLICING IS BROKEN. CHRISTIANS MUST REIMAGINE PUBLIC SAFETY](https://sojo.net/articles/us-policing-broken-christians-must-reimagine-public-safety) and [TIME FOR SOME GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR](https://sojo.net/articles/time-some-good-news-poor). Articles reviewed are usually properly sourced and align with the Democratic party politically.
Editorially, Sojourners aligns with the left, especially as it pertains to social justice and
[climate change](https://sojo.net/articles/climate-research-nearly-unanimous-climate-change-caused-human-activity). In general, the news is reported factually and with a moderate left-leaning bias.
