Funded by / Ownership
SciTechDaily lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership on the website. Some online sources claim SciTechDaily is owned by
[DailyEDeals](https://www.dailyedeals.com/), a company that provides advertising and coupons to large chain stores. However, we are unable to confirm their ownership. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
SciTechDaily publishes science and technology news through curated press releases from credible institutions like research universities, the
[New England Journal of Medicine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-england-journal-of-medicine-nejm/), and other credible journals. Topics are broken into the categories: Biology, Chemistry, Earth, Health, Physics, Science, Space, and Technology. Articles and headlines are low biased, reflecting the article’s content such as this [Discovery of Vital Role for the Brain’s Immune Cells Reveals a New Aspect of Human Biology](https://scitechdaily.com/discovery-of-vital-role-for-the-brains-immune-cells-reveals-a-new-aspect-of-human-biology/). This story is derived from the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
In general, the information on SciTechDaily is factual and presented with minimal bias. Despite factual content, they lack transparency in disclosing they are owned by an Ad company, thereby reducing their credibility.
