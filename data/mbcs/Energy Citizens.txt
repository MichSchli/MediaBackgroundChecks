History
Energy Citizens is a coalition of business organizations, anti-tax groups, and transportation companies that oppose a cap-and-trade plan while promoting increased domestic fossil fuel production. According to their
[mission](https://energycitizens.org/), “We are passionate and determined to see our nation develop balanced energy policies that strengthen our communities, support our families and make our nation more secure. We encourage discussion about our nation’s energy issues.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Energy Citizens lack transparency as they do not clearly disclose funding or ownership, but they are published by the
[American Petroleum Institute](https://www.api.org/), promoting fossil fuels. Donations generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
While Energy Citizens doesn’t outright reject
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they use sources like the [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/). Further, they made [two mostly false claims](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/energycitizensorg/statements/byruling/barely-true/), according to Politifact, over a decade ago. All articles on their blog promote the use of fossil fuels to help the economy and sustain growth. They do not state an official political affiliation; however, support for these issues is usually affiliated with the political right. Based on a few failed fact checks, poor sourcing, and supporting positions of the right, we rate Energy Citizens’ right biased and mixed for factual reporting.
