History of CNN
[In 1980](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/world/gallery/cnn-history/index.html), Ted Turner [founded](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/05/12/cnn-ted-turner-lisa-napoli) CNN, introducing the first 24-hour news channel. CNN’s original anchors, Bernard Shaw, and Lois Hart, helped establish comprehensive news coverage. The network gained recognition for covering events like the 1986 Challenger disaster and the 1991 Gulf War. Over time, CNN evolved into an international media organization, offering news segments in business, entertainment, and sports.
CNN International and HLN emerged, catering to global audiences. Today,

Analysis / Bias
[CNN](https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/cnn-fact-sheet/) is known for its comprehensive news coverage. However, some critics argue that the network exhibits a [liberal bias](https://www.newsnationnow.com/danabramslive/abrams-cnn-makes-vain-attempts-to-hide-its-bias/) in its reporting and editorial stance. CNN’s content may sometimes lean towards progressive viewpoints through the presentation of news stories, selection of guests, and framing of debates. For example, a [2017 Harvard study](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/) analyzing media coverage of President Trump’s first 100 days in office found that CNN’s coverage was 93% negative. Former President Trump and many of his supporters have criticized them as [fake news](http://fortune.com/2018/06/09/donald-trump-cnn-fake-news-g7/).
CNN’s TV programming provides a platform for diverse perspectives by hosting Democratic and Republican commentators and analysts.
[Ana Navarro](https://edition.cnn.com/profiles/ana-navarro) is a Republican commentator who frequently appears on CNN’s programming to provide commentary from a conservative perspective. [S.E. Cupp](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/s-e-cupp-profile) is also a conservative commentator who serves as a political analyst for CNN, providing insights on Republican policy and strategy. CNN also hired [Chris Wallace](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/chris-wallace) from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), another right-leaning commentator. By hosting commentators from both sides of the political spectrum, CNN aims to provide viewers with a well-rounded and balanced perspective on the news. However, the network has also experienced failed fact-checks in the past involving a few TV hosts, such as former [Don Lemon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/don-lemon-bias-rating/) and former Prime Time host Chris Cuomo, who is no longer with the network. Nonetheless, news reporting on the website generally remains well-sourced and fact-based.
Editorially, CNN’s programming favors the left. For example, a typical panel discussion will feature 4 to 8 guest commentators, one being a Republican, such as S.E. Cupp or Ana Navarro. This creates a situation where left-leaning voices drown out the right. Prominent news hosts include Wolf Blitzer,
[Erin Burnett](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/erin-burnett-bias-rating/), [Jake Tapper](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jake-tapper-bias-rating/), and [Anderson Cooper](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anderson-cooper-bias-rating/).
In general, CNN aims to provide a balanced and diverse range of perspectives by hosting commentators and analysts from Democratic and Republican backgrounds. Despite this, CNN exhibits a left-leaning bias by occasionally omitting negative stories about the left and promoting editorial perspectives favored by progressives. Though biased, the network generally maintains factual reporting on its website.
