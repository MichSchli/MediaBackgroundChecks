History
[Founded in 2013](http://whois.domaintools.com/themindunleashed.com), The Mind Unleashed is a strong conspiracy and pseudoscience website. According to their [about page](https://themindunleashed.com/about), “If ordinary people really knew that consciousness and not matter or material possessions is the link that connects us with each other and the world, then their views about war and peace, environmental pollution, social justice, religious values, and all other human endeavors would change radically.” The website discloses the owner with [minimal information](https://themindunleashed.com/contact).

Analysis / Bias
The Mind Unleashed review typically republishes articles from other sources, some credible and others not, such as
[Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). They also accept submitted articles from readers. The website generally publishes news that leans left, some being factual and others false. For example, they promote the 9-11 conspiracy of [controlled demolition](https://themindunleashed.com/2018/09/physicists-twin-towers-controlled-demolition.html), [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), [anti-Vaxx propaganda](https://themindunleashed.com/2018/04/i-was-poisoned-by-mercury-the-silent-heavy-metal-pandemic-that-could-be-affecting-you.html), [Mind Control](https://themindunleashed.com/2018/04/us-intelligence-accidentally-leaks-documents-on-electromagnetic-mind-control-weapons.html)…Well, you get the idea. In general, this is a very strong promoter of conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
