History
[Founded in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Yang#Newsbreak.com) by Jerry Yang and Jeff Zheng, NewsBreak is a website and popular app for iPhone and Android that aggregates local news based on location. News can also be selected in various categories, from Entertainment to World News. According to their [about page](https://www.newsbreak.com/about), “We surface the most impactful, most relevant news & information, wherever you live and work in the country. We work with thousands of local publishers and content creators to ensure you have access to the best local news sources and perspectives.” [According](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/meet-news-break-the-news-app-trending-in-america-founded-by-a-chinese-media-veteran/) to [Tech Crunch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/techcrunch/), “News Break now boasts 23 million monthly users with a growing network of more than 10,000 content providers.

Analysis
In review, News Break is a news aggregator that selects news through AI. When using News Break, whether on the Web or in the app, you are first asked to put in a zip code or city for your local newsfeed. Once this is done, News Break provides news stories from your local newspapers and TV stations. You can also select news from categories such as Headlines, Entertainment, sports, science, and politics.
News Break does not produce its own news reporting; therefore, we determined this source’s bias by analyzing the media outlets they aggregate from. We analyzed the sources used in their headlines and political feeds to assess bias. We looked at 100 different stories and calculated their bias based on MBFC’s rating of those sources. The most common sources used were
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), and [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/). The final tallies for source selections are below.
- Left: 16%
- Left-Center: 38%
- Least Biased: 40%
- Right-Center: 0%
- Right: 6%
Bias
In this review, we did not evaluate local news because this would be different for each user. The results indicate that 54% of news leans left, 40% is low biased, and 6% right. Of the 100 sources listed, 2 were from sources we list as Mixed for factual reporting. Further, we searched for the use of
[poor sources](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1497260341738/california-democrats-introduce-bill-to-protect-pedophiles-who-lure-and-sexually-abuse-innocent-children). We found that they have also used [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), which is a well-known purveyor of false medical information, especially as it relates to Coronavirus.
Finally, they have published satire as real news, such as this story
[FLORIDA: 400-POUND WOMAN SURVIVES SEXUAL ASSAULT BY HERD OF MANATEES](https://www.newsbreak.com/florida/fort-pierce/news/2102574310630/florida-400-pound-woman-survives-sexual-assault-by-herd-of-manatees). The full story originates from [World News Daily Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-news-daily/), which clearly displays the tagline ” Where Facts Don’t Matter.” In general, many stories are low biased and factual; however, using poor sources and satire as real news renders them Questionable.
