Analysis / Bias
In review, City Pages covers news and events related to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. This review focuses on news reporting. City Pages primarily only covers local news with minimally biased wording such as this:
[Charges: St. Paul man advertised stolen Apple watches on mom’s Facebook](http://www.citypages.com/news/charges-st-paul-man-advertised-stolen-apple-watches-on-moms-facebook/566982321). However, some reports contain commentary that does use loaded emotional language such as this: [Can we blame millennials for the cost of living in Minneapolis?](http://www.citypages.com/news/can-we-blame-millennials-for-the-cost-of-living-in-minneapolis/566947011). This story is properly sourced to [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) and the Star Tribune.
Editorially, City Pages does not have a section dedicated to opinion commentary, however sometimes authors offer commentary within news stories, usually with a very slight left leaning bias.
