Analysis / Bias
In review, the Anniston Star covers local news via journalists and national/international news through syndicated content from Consolidated’s network of papers and republishing from sources such as
[ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), [Reveal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reveal-center-for-investigative-reporting/), and the [Lincoln Journal Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lincoln-journal-star/). There is the moderate use of loaded emotional language that favors the left, such as this: [Trump’s Space Force declaration a small step, not giant leap.](https://www.annistonstar.com/news/trump-s-space-force-declaration-a-small-step-not-giant/article_1a9fe61c-7421-11e8-87f3-3ff3445ca15e.html)
In general, slightly more news stories favor the left; however, editorials have a frequent left-leaning bias such as
[Editorial: GOP must come clean, support truth in politics](https://www.annistonstar.com/opinion/editorial-gop-must-come-clean-support-truth-in-politics/article_e9b95e3c-89bd-11ec-9646-6fad8be42bbb.html). The sourcing of information is typically from credible factual media outlets.
