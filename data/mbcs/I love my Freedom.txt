History
Founded in 2015 by A. Ferretti, I Love My Freedom is a conservative news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://ilovemyfreedom.org/about-us/) “I Love My Freedom provides conservative commentary on the news stories of the day. With that being said, we aren’t shy to admit we’re biased. The majority of our articles will have a good amount of Pro-Trump opinion weaved into it.” Finally, they state “We love our country, we support our President, and we fully endorse his America-First agenda. We believe in strong borders, unabashed patriotism, and standing for our national anthem. We hold traditional American values that we believe should be preserved in our culture.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, I Love My Freedom typically takes a current news story and interjects right biased opinions around the story. There is significant use of loaded emotional language both in the headlines and articles themselves. For example, this headline utilizes strong emotional wording:
[Failed Dem Candidate Known For BURNING Her State Flag Says 2020 Run ‘On The Table’ [Details]](https://ilovemyfreedom.org/failed-dem-candidate-known-for-burning-her-state-flag-says-2020-run-on-the-table-details/). Within the article, they opine that “Both played the victim card – even the race card, at times.” This loaded statement is not backed up with hyperlinked evidence. The sourcing for this article comes from [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). In reviewing sources used for other stories we found many came from Right biased and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), all of which have very poor track records with fact-checkers.
Besides promoting Far-right biased propaganda, I love My Freedom also publishes misleading conspiracy theories such as the
[Seth Rich Murder](https://ilovemyfreedom.org/newt-gingrich-reveals-the-link-between-seth-richs-murder-and-dnc-corruption/) and the [Clinton’s committing acts of murder](https://ilovemyfreedom.org/outrage-google-omits-search-suggestions-clinton-body-count-proof/).
