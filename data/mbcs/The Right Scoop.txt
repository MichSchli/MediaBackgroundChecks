Analysis / Bias
The Right Scoop reports news with a right-wing bias in story selection and loaded wording that favors the right:
[Sarah Sanders releases blistering statement on Omarosa.](http://therightscoop.com/sarah-sanders-releases-blistering-statement-on-omarosa/) Rather than sourcing this story, they offer a block quote and opine about the statement. This is the norm for most stories on The Right Scoop; take a snippet of a news article and editorialize it with a right-leaning bias.
Editorially, all stories favor a conservative right perspective and frequently denigrate the left, such as this
[The left is using a new woke term, and it will make you roll your eyes HARD](https://therightscoop.com/the-left-is-using-a-new-woke-term-and-it-will-make-you-roll-your-eyes-hard/). Further, throughout 2020-2021 they published misinformation regarding Covid-19 and Election Fraud. For example, they claimed that [Joe Biden](https://therightscoop.com/joe-biden-wears-mask-on-video-call-with-world-leaders-and-hes-the-only-one/) was the only person to wear a mask at the climate summit in April 2021. According to [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/) and [other](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-mask-zoom-climate-summit/) fact-checkers, [this is not true](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/26/viral-image/no-biden-wasnt-only-world-leader-wear-mask-during-/).
Finally, they frequently repeated the false election fraud claims of former
[President Trump](https://therightscoop.com/trump-speaks-lights-up-pa-dems-refusing-to-allow-observers-points-out-most-ever-votes-for-sitting-president/) and [“My Pillow Guy” Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lindell-tv/). In general, The Right Scoop is far-right biased and frequently publishes false and misleading information.
