Analysis / Bias
An article by Geopolitical Monitor, headlined
[“Biden’s Next Regional Nightmare,”](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/bidens-next-regional-nightmare/) critiques the roles of [U.S. President Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan in the ongoing [Armenia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/armenia-government-and-media-profile/)– [Azerbaijan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/azerbaijan-government-and-media-profile/) conflict. The article frequently uses emotionally loaded language, such as “the failure of the Biden administration,” and describes actions as “treasonous by most of his constituents,” signaling a strong editorial stance. Terms like “caviar diplomacy” and “barbwire diplomacy” are used to intensify the narrative, and comparisons to a “concentration camp” highlight the author’s perceived severity of the situation.
Although the article cites credible sources, including
[CityLab](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/citylab/#google_vignette), state.gov, and ohchr.org, these appear to be used primarily to bolster the article’s specific viewpoint, thus not offering a balanced analysis of the conflict.
When it comes to science, Geopolitical Monitor generally aligns with the consensus. For instance, the article
[“India Must Begin Paving the Way to Ending Coal”](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/india-must-begin-paving-the-way-to-ending-coal/) articulates a well-structured argument for transitioning from coal to renewable energy in [India](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/india-media-profile/). It avoids sensational headlines and references detailed statistics and studies, such as those from Lazard’s levelized cost of energy analysis and Carbontracker.org.
Editorially, the website offers positions that show concern for
[climate change](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/cop26-a-setback-for-climate-justice-in-africa/), indicating a left-leaning perspective on this issue. In general, Geopolitical Monitor usually provides a balanced approach to reporting, but on some issues, it leans more left than right.
