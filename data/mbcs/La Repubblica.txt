[“Prime Minister Conte arrives: on the eve of the visit to sick children and workers.”](https://bari.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/12/24/news/taranto_premier_giuseppe_conte_ospedale_oncoematologia_ex_ilva_cena_caritas-244295502/?ref=search) They also publish local news such as [“Burst of thefts at home in Parma and in the province: two police arrests”](https://parma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/12/27/news/raffica_di_furti_in_casa_a_parma_e_in_provincia_due_arresti_della_polizia-244477544/) and [science news](https://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2019/12/27/news/come_sara_la_scienza_del_2020_traffico_su_marte_buchi_neri_e_biologia_sintetica-244482986/) regarding space and the [environment developments.](https://www.repubblica.it/ambiente/2019/12/26/news/fame_nel_mondo_il_fabbisogno_crescera_dell_80_entro_il_2100-244413493/) Further, they conduct their interviews such as [here](https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2019/03/19/news/edward_snowden_american_spies_in_italy_to_sway_economic_and_political_choices_-221967696/). For the most part, they utilize credible sources such as [Nasa.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nasa/), The European Space Agency (esa.int.), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) videos.
La Repubblica also owns online TV “RepTV” with themes such as
[“Cat stuck 20 meters high on the ring road barrier: the rescue”](https://video.repubblica.it/edizione/palermo/gatto-bloccato-a-20-metri-d-altezza-sulla-barriera-della-tangenziale-il-salvataggio/351013/351586?rss).
