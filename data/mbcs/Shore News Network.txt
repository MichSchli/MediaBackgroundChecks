Analysis / Bias
Shore News Network publishes a mixture of original news reporting and curated republishing from major sources such as the right-leaning
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and low-biased [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). The majority of news focuses on the state of NJ, broken down by counties. Articles in this category report straight news [Six Injured In North Bergen Crash Caused By DWI Driver](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2021/10/18/six-injured-in-north-bergen-crash-caused-by-dwi-driver/) and opinionated content favoring the right such as this [C’mon Man, Phil Murphy Says Opponents Are Desperate For Attacking Him On Unmasked Indoor Events](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2021/10/17/cmon-man-phil-murphy-says-opponents-are-desperate-for-attacking-him-on-unmasked-indoor-events/). News coverage from other states is mostly fact-based straight news reporting.
Editorially, there is a distinct conservative bias. For example, in the category US and World News, there is a subcategory titled “Biden Border Crisis” that features articles
[critical](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2021/10/15/millions-of-illegal-immigrants-could-get-amnesty-college-tuition-help-and-more-under-democrats-reconciliation-bill/) of the Biden administrations handling of immigration. The website does not label opinion content; however, authors’ opinion is present within news articles in their political section called “The Swamp,” in which they are often critical of liberal policies and politicians. For example, with this loaded headline [How Joe Biden’s America Is One Big Squid Game Where The Unvaccinated Are Slowly Being Eliminated From Society.](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2021/10/17/how-joe-bidens-america-is-one-big-squid-game-where-the-unvaccinated-are-slowly-being-eliminated-from-society/)
The website also reports on science and Covid-19 where they frequently oppose vaccine mandates such as this report from the far-right and low factual Candace Owens
[“Only Slaves Are Without Choice” Candace Owens Slams Southwest Airlines, American Airlines](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2021/10/17/only-slaves-are-without-choice-candace-owens-slams-southwest-airlines-american-airlines/). We also found that they promoted misinformation regarding Hydroxychlorquine [Doctors Sue FDA Over Withholding Hydroxychloroquine, Leading To Thousands Of Unnecessary Deaths During COVID-19](https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/06/17/doctors-sue-fda-over-withholding-hydroxychloroquine-leading-to-thousands-of-unnecessary-deaths-during-covid-19/). Numerous studies have shown that Hydroxychloroquine has little to no benefit in placebo-based double-blind studies [The end of Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19](https://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/end-hydroxychloroquine-treatment-covid-19). In general, news reporting is mostly factual, occasionally using poor sources and a failed fact check.
