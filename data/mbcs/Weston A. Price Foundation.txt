Analysis / Bias
In review, the Weston A. Price Foundation advocates for alternative health. The website publishes podcasts and most news and information comes from their quarterly journal Wise Traditions in Food, Farming and the Healing Arts.
The journal publishes articles with moderately emotional wording such as this:
[How Impersonal Vaccine Laws Play Out in Real Life: New York’s Repeal of the Religious Exemption](https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/how-impersonal-vaccine-laws-play-out-in-real-life-new-yorks-repeal-of-the-religious-exemption/). They also frequently promote pseudosciences such as [anti-vaccine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) propaganda [Help Prevent Mandatory Coronavirus Vaccination and Tracking!](https://www.westonaprice.org/help-prevent-mandatory-coronavirus-vaccination-and-tracking/), and [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) [Why are GMOs Bad For Us?](https://www.westonaprice.org/podcast/145-why-are-gmos-bad-for-us/) They have also advocated for drinking [unpasteurized milk,](https://www.westonaprice.org/call-your-kansas-representative-to-support-raw-milk/) which “ [according](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/dangers-raw-milk-unpasteurized-milk-can-pose-serious-health-risk) to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), from 1993 through 2012, there were 127 outbreaks linked to raw milk or raw milk products like ice cream, soft cheese, or yogurt. They resulted in 1,909 illnesses and 144 hospitalizations.” In general, this is a quackery level pseudoscience website.
