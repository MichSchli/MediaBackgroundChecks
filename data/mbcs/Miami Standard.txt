History
[Founded in 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/miamistandard.news), the Miami Standard is an anonymously published news website covering Florida and National news. The website lacks transparency as they do not have an about page, disclose ownership, or name authors.

Funded by / Ownership
The Miami Standard lacks transparency as they do not disclose who owns them. Advertising and an online shop that sells branded merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The Miami Standard does not produce original content or name authors. Each article is published by “
[Miami Standard Staff News](https://miamistandard.news/author/miamistandard/).” Furthermore, each article appears to be copied and pasted from other sources resulting in blatant plagiarism. The website does not change the headlines or provide a link to the source.
The Miami Standard plagiarizes credible sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [RFI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rfi-radio-france-internationale/), and local media such as nbcmiami.com. We also found that they summarize articles from other sources, such as the Right-Wing conspiracy website [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/).
Editorially, they negatively view the Biden Administration republishing articles from questionable sources such as the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which routinely fails fact checks [Biden Gang Caught Altering Another Transcript to Eliminate Another Biden Gaffe](https://miamistandard.news/2022/04/16/biden-gang-caught-altering-another-transcript-to-eliminate-another-biden-gaffe/). Further, they republish Covid-19 misinformation and anti-vaccination propaganda from the discredited [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) website, such as this [Vatican’s support for vaccines and mandates makes it COMPLICIT in vaccine deaths](https://miamistandard.news/2022/02/18/vaticans-support-for-vaccines-and-mandates-makes-it-complicit-in-vaccine-deaths/). Finally, some of their articles have failed fact checks. In general, the Miami Standard is right-biased and not always factual.
