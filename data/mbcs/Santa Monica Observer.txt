History
According to their
[about page](https://www.smobserved.com/about), “The Santa Monica Observer is a free weekly print newspaper of general circulation and interest, founded in Santa Monica, California in 1998.” The publisher is David Ganezer, who ran unsuccessfully for [Santa Monica City Council in 2010](https://www.smdp.com/meet-the-city-council-candidates-david-ganezer/77182).
On 10/29/2022, the Santa Monica Observer produced a story that was shared on Twitter by Elon Musk called “The Awful Truth: Paul Pelosi Was on Drugs And In a Dispute With a Male Prostitute Friday Morning.” Fact-checkers have
[debunked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/paul-pelosi-gay-prostitute/) the story. The story was temporarily offline but returned several hours later at this [link](https://www.smobserved.com/story/2022/10/29/news/the-awful-truth-paul-pelosi-was-drunk-again-and-in-a-dispute-with-a-male-prostitute-early-friday-morning/7191.html). Elon Musk also deleted the tweet. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Santa Monica Observer publishes a mix of local news and patently false information. There is a right-wing bias in story selection such as this:
[FBI: Hillary Clinton to face Criminal Indictment for Email Abuse Very Soon](https://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/06/09/news/fbi-hillary-clinton-to-face-criminal-indictment-for-email-abuse-very-soon/1334.html). This story also is not true. In general, non-local news favors the right and is almost always questionable. This is a classic imposter site masquerading as a local news source.
Failed Fact Checks
[Did Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Announce She Will Be Retiring in January 2019?](https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/11/29/ruth-bader-ginsburg-retire-january-2019/)– FALSE [The gunman in a November 2017 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas was identified as a Muslim convert named “Samir Al-Hajeed.”](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/texas-samir-al-hajeed-sam-hyde/)– FALSE [Paul Pelosi brought the man who attacked him with a hammer in October 2022 home from a gay bar.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/paul-pelosi-gay-prostitute/)– FALSE
These are two failed fact checks that were reported by IFCN fact-checkers; however, there are many others such as the SMO reporting,
[Kanye West Appointed Under-Secretary of the Interior After Meeting at Trump Tower](https://web.archive.org/web/20190118213749/https://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/12/16/news/kanye-west-appointed-under-secretary-of-the-interior-after-meeting-at-trump-tower/2378.html). Several things: first, Kanye West was not appointed Under-Secretary of the Interior, and second, there is no such position!
