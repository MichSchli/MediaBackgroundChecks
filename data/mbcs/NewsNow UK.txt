Analysis / Bias
In review, NewsNow aggregates news stories in real-time from news sources all over the world. News is broken down into categories such as UK, World, Business, Entertainment, Sport and Technology etc. The website does not produce original content but rather links to external sources. The website links to a wide variety of sources that range from the credible to the highly questionable such as the
[Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), [Sputnik](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/), and [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/). In general, NewsNow is a source that is not selective and does not appear to vet stories for credibility, therefore they are not biased based on story selection, but not all sources may be factual.
