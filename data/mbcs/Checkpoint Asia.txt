History
Established in 2019, Checkpoint Asia is a blog founded by Marko Marjanović who is a Russia Insider
[deputy editor](https://russia-insider.com/en/child-beheaders-join-turkeys-floundering-offensive-syrian-kurdish-pocket/ri22469) since 2014. [Russia Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-insider/) also states “Checkpoint Asia is his after hours project.” On their [about page](https://www.checkpointasia.net/team/) Marko Marjanović describes himself as “informed by libertarian anarchism” and Checkpoint Asia’s focus as “an Empire Watch”. Marjanović also describes “America” with a quote from his about page that reads “Asia is much too large, much too ancient, and much too proud to suffer US hegemony for too long. The salvation, the retreat of the Empire, starts in Asia.”
Besides writing for Russia Insider, Marko Marjanović has written for
[AntiWar](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-war/), [Mises](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mises-daily/), and the Libertarian Institute. He has also had his work republished in the following [questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) and [conspiracy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/) sources: New Cold War, [Off Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/offguardian/), [Signs of the Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/signs-of-the-times-sott/), [LewRockwell.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/), and [Global Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-research/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features, politics, war, finance and history, however, in general articles are either sourced to Russian affiliated media outlets, such as
[RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [Sputnik News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sputnik-news/), and Russia Insider; or similar narrative blogs such as Of Two Minds blog, tomluongo.me and the right leaning Mises Institute. They also utilize credible sources such as [The South China Morning Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-china-morning-post/) and [The Moscow Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/moscow-times/). Under every section, the news revolves around Anti-American narratives with strong emotionally loaded language both in the titles and the body of articles. Here are some examples: [“Who Cares About the F-35: This Is Why Russia Doesn’t Fear American Weapons”](https://www.checkpointasia.net/who-cares-about-the-f-35-this-is-why-russia-doesnt-fear-american-weapons/) and “ [Iran Was Chummy With Al-Qaeda — Back When Both Were on America’s Side in Bosnia and Afghanistan”](https://www.checkpointasia.net/iran-was-chummy-with-al-qaeda-back-when-both-were-on-americas-side-in-bosnia-and-afghanistan/). An emotionally loaded quote from the article reads “The shameless liar Mike Pompeo is attempting to draw a link between al-Qaeda and Iran so Trump can launch a war on Iran without Congressional approval…” In general, story selection is usually pro-Russian and anti-American, with many stories promoting [propaganda](https://www.checkpointasia.net/american-empire-is-a-desperate-and-weak-power-with-crumbling-credibility-and-elites-incapable-of-adapting-to-21st-century/) and [conspiracy theories](https://www.checkpointasia.net/chief-of-naval-operations-lauds-return-to-storied-tradition-of-false-flag-operations/).
