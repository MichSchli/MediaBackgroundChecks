Analysis
The Federalist is a news and opinion website that reports with a right-wing bias that typically favors the right and denigrates the left. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language:
[The New York Times Hit Piece On Mike Pence Is Anti-Christian Bigotry, Plain And Simple](http://thefederalist.com/2018/08/06/new-york-times-hit-piece-mike-pence-anti-christian-bigotry-plain-simple/). In general, The Federalist sources all of their information from credible mainstream outlets; however, they sometimes use sources that we have rated mixed for factual reporting, such as the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/).
According to an
[article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-federalist-embraces-anti-anti-trumpism-loses-its-way) from the left-leaning [Daily Beast,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) The Federalist was openly critical of Donald Trump before he won the election but has become a strong supporter of his Presidency and agenda. Further, In November 2017, The Federalist came [under criticism](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/362538-conservative-site-gets-major-blowback-after-defending-moore-dating-teens-to) from both conservatives and liberals for publishing an opinion piece by Ouachita Baptist University philosopher Tully Borland defending Roy Moore’s dating of teenagers while he was in his 30s and arguing that such behavior was “not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family.”
Bias
Regarding reporting on scientific issues, The Federalist often does not align with experts’ consensus in the field. For example, in this
[article](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/11/you-dont-need-to-be-a-scientist-to-be-legitimately-skeptical-of-climate-alarmism/), the author claims that “I am a skeptic when it comes to [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). To be clear, I don’t doubt that the climate changes — obviously it does. I don’t doubt that human activity affects this change. What that effect is, and to what extent it influences the entire system, I don’t know. As a scientific concept, I have no opinion on climate change.”
The author does seem to have an opinion on Climate change when he states, “So, simply put, I am a climate change skeptic because the people advocating it do not act as if it were a verified scientific conclusion.” Although the author freely admits he is not an expert and cannot generate an opinion on the scientific concept, he does not need to think because there is a
[strong scientific consensus](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/) on the impact of human-influenced climate change.
The Federalist has also promoted pseudoscience claiming that there is a link between
[Abortions and Breast Cancer](https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/25/a-five-month-abortion-limit-would-protect-womens-health/). According to the [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Induced-Abortion-and-Breast-Cancer-Risk?IsMobileSet=false), there is “no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk.” Finally, as seen in the failed fact checks section they often false and misleading information regarding Covid-19. In general, The Federalist is not a credible source of information.
