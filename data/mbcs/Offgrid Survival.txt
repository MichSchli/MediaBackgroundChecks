Analysis / Bias
In review, Offgrid Survival’s primary focus is on survival techniques and the necessary equipment needed. However, they also cover political topics with a
[far-right bias](https://offgridsurvival.com/left-wing-thugs-nyu/) in reporting. All articles related to political issues favor the right. In some cases, Offgrid Survival promotes conspiracy theories such as impending [World War III](https://offgridsurvival.com/wwiii-trump-bombs-syria-russia-warns-strikes-will-lead-negative-consequences/) and [shadow government conspiracies](https://offgridsurvival.com/shadowgovernmentwars/). Offgrid Survival also has an [unproven claim](http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/haddad.asp), according to [Snopes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/snopes/), and is on a [fake news list](http://www.bullshido.net/list-bs-fake-biased-news-sites/).
Scientifically, they report with skepticism on the Covid Vaccines such as this
[Fauci Admits Vaccine Could enhance COVID infection: Gates Says You Will Need Multiple Injections](https://offgridsurvival.com/fauci-admits-vaccine-could-enhance-covid-infection-gates-says-you-will-need-multiple-injections/). They also reported on the debunked election fraud narrative, such as this [FOX News Cuts off White House Press Secretary when she presents Evidence of Voter Fraud – The Fix is In!](https://offgridsurvival.com/fox-news-cuts-off-white-house-press-security-when-she-presents-evidence-of-voter-fraud-the-fix-is-in/). While our methodology doesn’t consider this a fake news source due to considerable credible information, it certainly is right-wing biased and mixed for factual reporting, especially concerning politics and science.
