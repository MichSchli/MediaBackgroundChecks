History
Founded in 1975, The Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the lobbying arm of the NRA. According to their
[about page](https://www.nraila.org/about/) “ILA is committed to preserving the right of all law-abiding individuals to purchase, possess and use firearms for legitimate purposes as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” They further state “While the NRA is a single-issue organization, the Institute is involved in any issue that directly or indirectly affects firearms ownership and use.”
Chris W. Cox was the Executive Director from 2002 until June 2019, when he
[resigned](https://abcnews.go.com/US/top-nra-executive-chris-cox-resigns-amid-tumultuous/story?id=63962673) after purportedly being placed on administrative leave. According to an [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) report “The group has been under both [internal and external scrutiny of late](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/prominent-nra-board-member-imperative-nra-cleans-house/story?id=63031988) amid reports of alleged financial mismanagement. Its former president, Oliver North, [resigned in April](https://abcnews.go.com/US/oliver-north-nra-president-leadership-dispute-longtime-ceo/story?id=62676063) and the fallout has continued in connection to ongoing lawsuits.” As of this date, a new executive director has not been appointed.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the NRA-ILA website publishes press releases and news related to guns and gun rights. Under the News section, you find articles related to gun rights that often use emotional wording such as this:
[Hollywood Fantasy v. Reality on Firearm Suppressors](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20190715/hollywood-fantasy-v-reality-on-firearm-suppressors). Like most stories on the website they do not name the author and use minimal sourcing. Under the Get the Facts tab they report on issues that can be backed with evidence such as this: [“Assault Weapons” and “Large” Magazines](https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/assault-weapons-large-magazines/). While this fact check is sourced to credible outlets such as the FBI, it also follows the pattern of only reporting the positives of guns. This of course makes sense since they are a part of the gun lobby. Lastly, they have a section where they [republish gun related news](https://www.nraila.org/news/in-the-news/) from external sources. Most of the sources are credible, such as local TV stations and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), however, some appear on our factually Mixed list such as [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/) and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). In general, the NRA-ILA is right biased in reporting.
