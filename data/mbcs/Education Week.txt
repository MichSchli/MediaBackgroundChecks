In review, articles and headlines often utilize moderate emotional language, such as
[“What Education Issues Did Voters Care About Most? Hint: It Was Not Critical Race Theory.” ](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/what-education-issues-did-voters-care-about-most-hint-it-was-not-critical-race-theory/2022/12)This story, like most, is properly sourced from credible outlets such as The National Education Association (NEA) (the largest labor union in the United States).
