Analysis / Bias
In review, The Skeptical Raptor reports on science news, in particular pseudoscience, which they debunk with evidence. For example, in this article,
[Gardasil facts – debunking myths about HPV vaccine safety and efficacy](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/one-stop-shop-science-myth-debunking-gardasil/), there is excellent sourcing from the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/). Another article that clearly uses emotional wording: [Anti-vaccine terrorists – maybe it is the time to call them that](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/anti-vaccine-terrorists-time-call-them/); there is excellent sourcing from credible media such as [Pubmed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/) and [Medscape](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/medscape/). Skeptical Raptor also has a [science based search engine](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/vaccine-search-engine/) specifically for vaccines.
