[Man detained, gunman at large after shots fired on I-95 in NW Miami-Dade](https://wsvn.com/news/local/man-detained-gunman-at-large-after-shots-fired-on-i-95-in-nw-miami-dade/). This story is sourced from video and first-person accounts. US and world news is republished from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Under the politics tab, reporting comes from the AP, CNN, and local journalists when pertaining to local politics. Local political reporting contains little bias, such as this: [Biden courts South Floridaâ€™s Hispanic vote at Little Havana event](https://wsvn.com/news/politics/biden-courts-south-floridas-hispanic-vote-at-little-havana-event/).
The website does not publish op-eds. In general, local news reporting is straightforward and factual, while syndicated news is derived from left-leaning CNN.
