[Serge Dassault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Dassault) and his late son was subject to conflict-of-interest, as both of them were members of the center-right political party Les Républicains. Further, the Dassault Group produces the Rafale combat aircraft for the military, which is often subject to corrupt business dealings and “influence peddling” allegations such as [“French judge tasked with investigating Rafale fighter jet sale to India.”](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210702-french-judge-tasked-with-investigating-rafale-fighter-jet-sale-to-india)
