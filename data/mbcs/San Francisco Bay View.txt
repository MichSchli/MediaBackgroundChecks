Analysis / Bias
In review, the San Francisco Bay View covers news and culture for African American communities in the San Francisco area and around the nation. The paper and website provide original reporting with articles and headlines containing emotionally loaded language such as this
[Racist practices at the SF Health Service System will no longer be tolerated: Remove Mitchell Griggs now!](https://sfbayview.com/2020/12/racist-practices-at-the-sf-health-service-system-will-no-longer-be-tolerated-remove-mitchell-griggs-now/) Story selection often focuses on black rights and injustice, such as this [The messy truth: Extortion, bargaining, and how we must oppose the new SFPOA contract](https://sfbayview.com/2020/11/the-messy-truth-extortion-bargaining-and-how-we-must-oppose-the-new-sfpoa-contract/). They also cover national and world news. When it comes to sourcing, they typically do not hyperlink to external sources.
Editorially, a strong left-leaning bias favors Black Liberation and pro-labor positions such as this
[Until we win: Black labor and liberation in the disposable era](https://sfbayview.com/2015/10/until-we-win-black-labor-and-liberation-in-the-disposable-era/). In general, the news is reported factually from a progressive liberal perspective.
