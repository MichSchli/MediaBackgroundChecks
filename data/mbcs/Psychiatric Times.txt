Analysis / Bias
The Psychiatric Times publishes articles such as “
[Psychedelic Daily “Vitamins”: Social Psychiatric Prediction #2.”](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychedelic-daily-vitamins-social-psychiatric-prediction-2) While this article does not take a strong positive or negative stance on micro-dosing, the article focuses mainly on its potential benefits and supports its claims by citing sources such as the pro-science site [Psychology Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/psychology-today/).
Another article on the site,
[“Psychiatry, “Dangerousness,” and the President,”](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychiatry-dangerousness-president) takes a clear stance against using psychiatry to assess the potential dangerousness of public figures based solely on secondhand information or media reports. The author cites the [American Medical Association (AMA)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-medical-association-ama/) and ethical principles of the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/ethics), including the Goldwater Rule, which prohibits psychiatrists from publicly speculating about the mental health of public figures. In general, the Psychiatric Times is a pro-science source based on evidence-based peer-reviewed research studies.
