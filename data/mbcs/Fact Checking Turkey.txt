Funded by / Ownership
Neither Fact-checking Turkey nor Bosphorus Center for Global Affairs’ ownership is disclosed. However, the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF) reports that President Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak funds the site.
[Here](https://ecpmf.eu/news/threats/ahmet-ks-blocked-defence-speech) is a quote from the report: “Suheyb Ogut manages numerous troll accounts and websites publishing similar sorts of information with financial support from the Presidential Palace’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak. 23 separate troll accounts that were activated between September 27, 2015 and September 20, 2016, are directed by ‘Global Relations Association’ which is known as ‘Bogazici Global Relations Center.’
Analysis / Bias
In review, Fact-Checking Turkey researches the accuracy of claims by pundits, columnists, and political analysts by utilizing state-subsidized and factually mixed sources, such as
[Anadolu Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anadolu-agency/) and the [Daily Sabah,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-sabah/) as well as some [credible international sources](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/12/us-warplanes-anti-isis-air-strikes-syria-turkey). Although they use mostly credible sources such as The [Guardian,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) they spin the information into a favorable narrative for the government. In reviewing numerous fact checks on the website, every single one was positive toward Turkey and the Government. While the information and sources may contain elements of truth, the selection of fact checks is biased in favor of the Turkish Government, particularly the ruling AKP party.
According to
[Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/news/these-fake-fact-checkers-are-peddling-lies-about-genocide-and-censorship-turkey), “Fact-Checking Turkey is not a fact-checking service, but rather a project to counter articles critical of Turkey’s government.” They further state, “Unlike nonpartisan fact-checkers, Fact-Checking Turkey does not use a transparent methodology to adjudicate claims.”
