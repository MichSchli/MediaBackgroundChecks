Analysis / Bias
In review, the website offers stories with loaded emotional wording to scare people regarding their health, such as this
[HARVARD SCIENTIST URGES PEOPLE TO STOP DRINKING “LOW-FAT” AND SWEETENED MILK IMMEDIATELY](https://www.davidwolfe.com/stop-drinking-low-fat-milk/). Interestingly this story is not linked to Harvard but to other questionable sites such as [Rense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rense/), a non-credible pseudoscience website.
Other debunked claims by this website are that
[vaccines cause autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). [They don’t](https://thewest.com.au/news/perth/protest-over-anti-vaxxers-perth-talk-ng-b88400454z). Further, he [promotes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2016/01/01/a-new-years-resolution-for-science-advocates-dont-cry-wolfe/#46a0726311fd) dangerous [cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), which are not proven. Finally, he also encourages [detoxification](https://www.davidwolfe.com/detox-bath-recipes/), which is [unproven to work](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-detoxification/). In general, almost everything on this website needs to be questioned as almost everything clicked is either false or misleading.
