Analysis / Bias
In review, From the Trenches World Report generally covers news and information related to how the federal reserve has led to a one-world order. The premise is that the USA should enforce the Bill of Rights. The website frequently republishes news from other questionable sources such as
[Alt-Market](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/alt-market/), [State of the Nation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/state-of-the-union-2012/), [The Ron Paul Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-ron-paul-institute/), and [SHTF Plan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shtfplan-com/). Many stories promote conspiracy theories and pseudosciences such as [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), [the Clinton Body count](https://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/clinton-body-count-epstein-suicided-mena-iran-contra-barry-seal-medellin-part-2-railroad-murders/260454), the [Seth Rich Murder conspiracy](https://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/assange-says-dnc-seth-rich-murdered-clinton-leaking-dnc-emails-wikileaks-2016/185903), and numerous others relating to the [new world order](https://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/the-great-reset-plan-revealed-how-covid-ushers-in-the-new-world-order/269045). In general, this is a far-right-wing tin foil hat conspiracy website.
