Analysis / Bias
[The newspaper backed a ‘No’ vote in the referendum on Scottish independence](http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/scotland-s-decision-the-scotsman-s-verdict-1-3537857). However, they also published their pledge for impartiality in all 2017 elections: “Scotsman’s [ 2017 election manifesto”.](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/the-scotsman-s-2017-election-manifesto-1-4434541)
The Scotsman uses neutral language both in their headlines and articles, such as
[“Scottish independence ‘would be terrible’ says Donald Trump”](http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-independence-would-be-terrible-says-donald-trump-1-4519872) and national news, such as “ [Philip Hammond warns SNP over tax rises.”](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/philip-hammond-warns-snp-over-tax-rises-1-4569331) They also use credible sources, such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/); however, they occasionally publish opinion pieces with sensational headlines: [“Did teetotal Donald Trump drink wine at the UN?”](http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/did-teetotal-donald-trump-drink-wine-at-the-un-1-4564895) For the most part, this is a neutral news reporting site that is factual.
