Analysis / Bias
In reviewing this website, we only looked at the news they report, which is almost always favorable to the left and negative toward the right. When reporting news, they typically provide a snippet from a credible news source such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) or [MSN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msn-com/) and then have people comment on it. Basically, this is a news curation site that favors the left.
Editorially, users submit news stories that people comment on. Most stories strongly favor the left, such as this

Due to the unpredictability of the people posting information, we rate them Mixed for factual reporting.
