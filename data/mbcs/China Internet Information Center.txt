History
Launched in 2000, China.org.cn, also known as The China Internet Information Center (CIIC), is a state-owned news website based in the People’s Republic of China. According to their
[about page](http://www.china.org.cn/2009-09/28/content_18620394.htm), The China Internet Information Center (CIIC) states that they cover news about China in ten [languages](http://www.chinagoabroad.com/en/contributor/the-china-internet-information-center): Chinese, English, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Korean, and Esperanto, as well as government position papers and information about Chinese history, politics, economics, and culture. Currently, [Wang Xiaohui](http://www.china.org.cn/world/2015-02/09/content_34774506.htm) is the Editor-in-Chief.

Funded by / Ownership
In their own
[words](http://www.china.org.cn/2009-09/28/content_18620394.htm), the China Internet Information Center (CIIC) is “published under the auspices of the State Council Information Office and the China International Publishing Group in Beijing.” The Communist Party of China owns the China International Publishing Group, and the state funds them.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the China Internet Information Center publishes articles with emotionally loaded language, such as this quote regarding
[Hong Kong](http://www.china.org.cn/china/2019-09/15/content_75207132.htm) “Hong Kong residents voice support for police, national unity.” They report with bias in this article by representing only the pro-Beijing perspective as they do not report on police brutality directed at the protesters. Other articles serve as propaganda for the Communist Party, such as this: [China to become first to realize UN goal of ‘no poverty](http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-01/08/content_75590502.htm).’ This story is not hyperlinked to sources that can validate its claims.
Regarding sourcing, they don’t use hyperlinks but quotes, such as in this
[article](http://www.china.org.cn/video/2013-06/30/content_29274750.htm), where they mention [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and Russian propaganda TV station [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/). When covering world news about the USA, they cover the former Trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this [“Assassination of Soleimani will put Trump in crisis.”](http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2020-01/06/content_75582876.htm) However, they also feature well-written analysis of world affairs that is minimally biased, such as this: [The Middle East in 2019](http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2019-12/26/content_75545203.htm); unfortunately, this story also is not sourced, which does not allow the reader the opportunity to validate their claims. In general, CIIC promotes Communist Party propaganda by omitting negative reporting on China and frequent positive reporting regarding the Chinese Government.
