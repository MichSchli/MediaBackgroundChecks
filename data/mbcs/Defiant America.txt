History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/defiantamerica.com), Defiant America is an extreme right news and opinion blog that often publishes misinformation. According to their [about page](https://defiantamerica.com/about-us/), “Defiant America strives to be a loud voice across this great nation in defiance of the far left’s attacks on our liberties, including self-defense, Christianity, keeping what we earn, free speech, protection against illegal search and seizure, due process, free-market capitalism and property rights.
