Analysis / Bias
In review, there are simply too many instances to list that David Icke is an over-the-top conspiracy theorist, but this is the one that he is most famous for: Icke believes many public figures are
[reptilian humanoids and paedophiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w2dMekIJLw) or as he calls them “The Reptilian Illuminati.”
When not reporting on reptilian humanoids, David Icke promotes anti-vaccine propaganda, aliens, 9/11 conspiracies, and
[chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/). He also supports Brexit and tends to hold a right-leaning bias.
Mr. Icke is either the greatest con artist in history having amassed over 20 million dollars on books and speeches or he is certifiably insane.
