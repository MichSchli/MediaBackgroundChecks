Analysis / Bias
In review, Standpoint Magazine utilizes emotionally loaded language that favors the right in their headlines such as “
[Watchmen of the West “](http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/manchester-square-may-2018-daniel-johnson-watchmen-of-the-west?page=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0) and “ [The Great Betrayal: How Liberals Appease Islam.“](http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/features-january-february-2015-great-betrayal-liberals-appease-islam-nick-cohen-the-left)
Regarding US politics their word choices are pro-Trump. The following is a quote from an
[article](http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/manchester-square-may-2018-daniel-johnson-watchmen-of-the-west?page=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0): “President Trump may not be the ideal leader of the free world. But he understands what is at stake, he knows what must be done and he has the willpower to see it through. It is time for the high-minded to set aside their low expectations and judge Mr Trump by his actions rather than his words. There is a method in his “madman diplomacy”. And it seems to be working.“
On national politics, the editorial opinion of Standpoint Magazine is conservative, usually supporting Theresa May. In
[this article](http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/features-november-2016-daniel-johnson-theresa-may-margaret-thatcher-heir?page=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1) they are drawing parallels between May and Thatcher with this quote: “Mrs May shares the same instinct: she sides with the little people who often struggle to survive in a global marketplace. Like Mrs Thatcher, she believes in a property-owning democracy, a nation in which hard work and solid achievement, rather than slick presentation or nifty networking, are rewarded. Like Mrs Thatcher, her parents were too poor to pay school fees.”
When soliciting for
[donations](http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/6742), Standpoint utilizes conservative fears over terrorism and immigration as a threat to society: “In the era of global terrorism and uncontrolled migration, internal and external threats to our values and identity, that mission to preserve Western civilization has never been more necessary.”
Standpoint does not source their information well, using quotes rather than hyperlinked or MLA formatted sourcing.
