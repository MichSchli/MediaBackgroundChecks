History
[Founded in 2019](https://whois.domaintools.com/thecareerbd.com), Flashout (thecareerbd.com) is an anonymously published celebrity gossip and entertainment news website. The website lacks transparency as they do not describe its mission, name authors, or ownership. It is also unclear where they originate from.
Funded by / Ownership
Flashout does not disclose ownership. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Flashout primarily publishes celebrity and entertainment news. They frequently use loaded sensational wording such as this
[Katy Perry Revealed What It Is Like to Be the Most Hated Celebrity in the World, and How She Managed to Cope](https://thecareerbd.com/katy-perry-revealed-what-it-is-like-to-be-the-most-hated-celebrity-in-the-world-and-how-she-managed-to-cope/). This story, like most, is unsourced. It is pasted verbatim from [another site](https://cheery.world/discover-people/katy-perry-revealed-what-it-is-like-to-be-the-most-hated-celebrity-in-the-world-and-how-she-managed-to-cope-with-it-1228/?utm_source=tsp_pages&utm_medium=fb_organic&utm_campaign=fb_gr_now_i_ve_seen_everything&fbclid=IwAR3mV5G6kFORoBbkDG1C1SZN4-8t1Ca7UX7BHB3wVsM7gVHjUMldyvU3GbU) without credit (plagiarism).
Editorially, they occasionally cover politics reporting on President negatively, such as this
[Joe Biden FALLS OFF his bike during ride near home](https://thecareerbd.com/joe-biden-falls-off-his-bike-during-ride-near-home/). However, they also report negatively on former President Trump like this [Opinion | Who was the biggest loser Tuesday? Trump.](https://thecareerbd.com/opinion-who-was-the-biggest-loser-tuesday-trump/) Again, both of these stories are unsourced. Flashout has also made false claims, as evidenced by a failed fact check below.
