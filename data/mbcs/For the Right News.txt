Analysis / Bias
In review, For the Right News primarily publishes pro-Conservative and pro-Trump opinion commentary. Headlines and wording are often very emotional, favoring the right such as this:
[Democrat Impeachment Campaign is a Smokescreen for Democrats Do-Nothing Agenda](https://www.fortherightnews.com/articles/democrat-impeachment-campaign-is-a-smokescreen-for-democrats-do-nothing-agenda/) and this: [The Weather Channel is Pushing Climate Scare Propaganda](https://www.fortherightnews.com/articles/the-weather-channel-is-pushing-climate-scare-propaganda/). Neither of these stories contains hyperlinked sourcing to validate their claims. In general, this is a right-wing propaganda site that completely lacks credibility through a lack of sourcing and transparency.
