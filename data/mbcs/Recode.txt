Analysis / Bias
In review, Recode primarily covers technology and silicon valley business news. Headlines and articles feature minimally loaded words such as this
[What it’s really like to live with so-called smart devices](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/2/18511551/living-smart-apartment-alexa-google-assistant-nest-furbo). This article is properly sourced to credible media outlets as are most on the Recode website. Editorially, Recode does not directly cover politics, however, they do write articles pertaining to political policy and its impact on tech and business. These articles are typically neutral with some that [lean left](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18525316/facebook-research-data-democracy-cambridge-analytica). In general, this is not a politically driven website.
