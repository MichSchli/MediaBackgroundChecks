China Daily is funded through [advertising](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/static_e/Advertise_Site.html) and [subscriptions](http://subscription.chinadaily.com.cn/subscribe/Account/UserTypeChange?userType=0); however, we could not find the details of government funding. According to an Economist [article](https://www.economist.com/china/2018/06/14/china-is-spending-billions-on-its-foreign-language-media) titled “China is spending billions on its foreign-language media,” the government funds the media.
Analysis / Bias
[Reporters Without Borders (RSF)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) has [described](https://rsf.org/en/reports/rsf-report-chinas-pursuit-new-world-media-order) how China uses its political influence to export its media model to other countries with a report titled “ [China’s Pursuit of a New World](https://dig.watch/updates/china%E2%80%99s-pursuit-new-world-media-order).”
Here are some examples of the National news coverage of China Daily: After a major drugmaker was found to be supplying expired
[vaccines](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2156357/new-vaccine-scandal-grips-china-parents-say-theyve-lost) to children, China Daily published an editorial with a critical tone, [“Transparency can help ease panic over vaccine scandal: China Daily Editorial.”](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201807/22/WS5b546aa9a310796df4df7edd_1.html) China Daily typically sources to [Xinhua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency) News Agency or New China News Agency (China’s official state-run press agency). They also publish articles criticizing western media on The Xinjiang conflict centered around the Uyghurs, [“Reality of Xinjiang different from that portrayed by West](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201810/18/WS5bc87afaa310eff30328336e.html).” [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/bulldozing-mosques-china-war-uighur-culture-xinjiang) and [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/china-s-xinjiang-province-a-surveillance-state-unlike-any-the-world-has-ever-seen-a-1220174.html), among others, report this story quite differently.
When covering world news about the USA, they use loaded language such as “No credibility to Trump’s China-hacking tweets,” with a quote from the
[article](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/30/WS5b87edc0a310add14f388b92.html) that reads, “To the thinking person, there are few things more disconcerting than a tweet by the US president as they initially seem to accord to reality but then quickly turn into messages from some alternative universe.”

- Although they have not failed many fact-checks, the Government controls what is printed, which always supports the Communist Party of China.
