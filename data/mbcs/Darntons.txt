Analysis / Bias
In our review of Darntons, we examined several articles. The first article,
[“We Didn’t Just Contact Aliens, We Contacted Something Much Worse,”](https://darntons.com/2023/09/02/we-didnt-just-contact-aliens-we-contacted-something-much-worse-a-comprehensive-review-of-ufo-sightings/) suggests that UFO sightings could be more dangerous than thought and uses emotionally loaded language, raising concerns about its credibility. However, it cites the [Federation of American Scientists (FAS)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/federation-of-american-scientists-fas/#google_vignette) as its source, rated as credible by MBFC.
The second article,
[“READ: CA Could Remove Kids from Anti-Trans Parents,”](https://darntons.com/2023/09/11/read-ca-could-remove-kids-from-anti-trans-parents/) discusses a California bill that could affect custody rights for parents who do not support their child’s gender transition. The article cites various sources, including EdSource, Leginfo, legislature.ca.gov, [City Journal,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/city-journal/) The FP, [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/), and Our Duty Group. These sources vary in their credibility and perspective. While this story reports factually on aspects of the bill, it is also [misleading](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/jun/22/facebook-posts/california-bill-affects-custody-disputes-doesnt-ch/) as custody determination is related to abuse, which may include Transgender abuse but is not the only factor.
Lastly, the article
[“Don’t Take Climate Change’s Blame Too Lightly”](https://darntons.com/2023/08/27/read-dont-take-climate-changes-blame-too-lightly/) borrows heavily from an [article](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/blaming-climate-change-for-everything-is-lazy-vdch2zxpp) published by [The Times UK and The Sunday Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/). It criticizes the media’s portrayal of climate change as alarmist and suggests that the issue is often oversimplified. The article questions the credibility of phrases like “scientists say” and implies that the urgency around climate change may be a form of social hysteria. This framing could be seen as downplaying the scientific consensus on climate change, thus revealing a skeptical or contrarian stance.
Editorially, most stories favor the right, with some promoting conspiracy theories and pseudoscience, like this
[article](https://darntons.com/2023/09/07/read-growing-medical-evidence-questions-covid-19-vaccines/) claiming COVID-19 vaccines increase [Myocarditis](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/scicheck-benefits-of-covid-19-vaccination-outweigh-the-rare-risk-of-myocarditis-even-in-young-males/) and an [increasing risk](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/06/scicheck-cleveland-clinic-study-did-not-show-vaccines-increase-covid-19-risk/) of Covid with more doses. Both of these claims have been debunked.
