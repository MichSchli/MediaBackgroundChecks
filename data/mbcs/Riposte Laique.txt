[about page](https://ripostelaique.com/qui-sommes-nous-2), “The Riposte Laïque site was created in August 2007 by former hosts of the online journal Respublica. It claims secular and republican principles and brings together patriots of left and right who do not accept the Islamization of their country and the complicit silence of the left and the right in the face of this mortal peril for our values.” [Read our profile on French media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Riposte Laique primarily publishes news and opinion articles from anonymous contributors. Articles are news summaries from other sources, both credible and questionable, with added commentary by the writer. Headlines and article content often contain loaded emotional language that favors the right such as this
[All have the blood of the victims of the Bataclan on their hands, except Z and Marine](https://ripostelaique.com/tous-ont-sur-les-mains-le-sang-des-victimes-du-bataclan-sauf-z-et-marine.html). This article explains that politicians who support immigration are responsible for the Paris nightclub attack in 2019, while Far-right Nationalist Marine Le Pen is glorified for her anti-Islamist stance.
Editorially, they clearly state that they are anti-immigration and anti-globalist. The website reflects the views of their founder
[Pierre Cassen](https://ripostelaique.com/acheter-nos-livres) who is described as a “well-known figure in the patriotic sphere. Lover of his country, great slayer of the globalist ideology and the Islamization of France.” Besides promoting Islamaphobia, they also publish misinformation and make false claims such as this [Confirmed: the coronavirus is indeed a biological warfare weapon](https://web.archive.org/web/20200322140627/https://ripostelaique.com/confirme-le-coronavirus-est-bien-une-arme-de-guerre-biologique.html). There is [no evidence](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to support this conspiracy theory. Finally, during the 2020 Presidential election, they frequently promoted the false claims of election fraud committed by Democrats [United States: the biggest electoral fraud in history!](https://ripostelaique.com/etats-unis-la-plus-enorme-fraude-electorale-de-lhistoire.html) There has been no evidence of widespread election fraud that could have changed the outcome of the election. In general, Riposte Laique promotes far-right biased, anti-Islamic hate.
