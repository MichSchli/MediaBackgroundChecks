History
Founded in 2013, Faithit.com is a website that publishes inspirational and spiritual news from a conservative perspective. According to their
[about page](https://faithit.com/about-us/), “What would happen if millions of people worked together to express their faith online daily by sharing the most cause-driven, faith-based and inspirational stories with their friends?” They state their mission as “to go through the never-ending sea of information on the Internet to uncover the most important faith-based stories and give them massive attention.”
FaithIt lacks transparency as they do not list an editor, staff bios, or ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
As stated above, FaithIt does not disclose ownership; however, a search connects the website to a company called
[Outreach, Inc,](https://www.outreach.com/print/article_full.aspx?article_name=a-aboutus&ref=Footer) which publishes other religious-based websites. They state their mission is “To equip the Church to reach people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.” Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, FaithIt publishes stories from contributors and summarized stories from other sources. Articles and headlines often contain moderately loaded emotional language, such as
[“If You Want to Know Where I Stand, I Am a True Prodigal of God”: Cop Shatters Racial Barriers With Christian Roots](https://faithit.com/prodigal-god-black-cop-shatters-racial-barriers-christian-roots/). This story is unsourced. They also have a section called “Causes” which publishes news that we assume are causes they support. For example, in this story, they support racial justice: [Minneapolis Mayor: “George Floyd Would Be Alive Today if He Were White. The Officer Killed Someone.”](https://faithit.com/minneapolis-mayor-george-floyd-alive-today-if-he-were-white/) This story is appropriately sourced to [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) and Churchleaders.com.
Editorially, FaithIt publishes information that is favorable to the right such as anti-abortion information
[2,411 Unborn Babies Found in Abortion Doctor’s House Given Mass Burial in Indiana](https://faithit.com/2411-unborn-babies-found-house-abortion-doctor-mass-burial-indiana/), and a right-leaning perspective on LGBTQ [Why I Had a Married Gay Couple Over for Dinner, And I Didn’t Point Out Their Sin](https://faithit.com/married-gay-couple-over-dinner-didnt-point-out-sin-ethan-renoe/). Finally, they have published misleading information on vaccines, such as this: [Vaccines, Sunscreens & the “Sneaky Lie” Moms Need to Stop Believing](https://faithit.com/vaccines-sunscreens-sneaky-lie-moms-stop-believing-sara-wallace/), and false information regarding birth control and breast cancer. This [article](https://faithit.com/sade-patterson-real-sex-week-university-new-mexico/) claims that “use oral contraceptives have up to 10 times the risk of developing breast cancer as does a non-user.” According to the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet#:~:text=Breast%20cancer%3A%20An%20analysis%20of,had%20never%20used%20oral%20contraceptives.), “women who had ever used oral contraceptives had a slight (7%) increase in the [relative risk](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000618613&version=Patient&language=English) of breast cancer compared with women who had never used oral contraceptives.” In general, FaithIt publishes news stories that align with the Christian Right and sometimes are not factual.
