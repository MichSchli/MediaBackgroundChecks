Analysis / Bias
In review, HealthyWay publishes news regarding health, fitness, nutrition, and environmental sustainability. There is minimal use of loaded language, and all information is usually supported with proper sourcing to credible media or Pro-Science websites. Politically, HealthyWay has a left-leaning bias as they support policy to combat
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and generally favor environmental protection. On all other science matters, HealthyWays recognizes the [consensus of science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as [vaccine safety](https://www.healthyway.com/content/dangerous-anti-vaccination-arguments-that-need-to-be-shut-down/).
However, we have found instances where they lightly promote pseudoscience, claiming that
[Essential Oils](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-essential-oils/) can be effective for Asthma [Your Guide To Natural Antihistamines: What To Know When Allergy Symptoms Arrive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210211171550/https://www.healthyway.com/content/your-guide-to-natural-antihistamines-what-to-know-when-allergy-symptoms-arrive/). There is no evidence to support essential oils in the treatment of Asthma, but there is [evidence](https://www.aaaai.org/Allergist-Resources/Ask-the-Expert/Answers/Old-Ask-the-Experts/oil-diffusers-asthma) it can trigger an asthma attack. In general, HealthyWay is fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias; however, they sometimes promote pseudoscience reducing their credibility.
