History
The Institute for Historical Review (IHR) was founded in 1978 by
[David McCalden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCalden), also known as Lewis Brandon, a former member of the [British National Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Front), and [Willis Carto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Carto), the head of the now-defunct Liberty Lobby. Liberty Lobby was an antisemitic organization best known for publishing [The Spotlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotlight), now reorganized as the [American Free Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Free_Press). IHR is best known for publishing articles and books promoting Holocaust denial. The Institute published the [Jou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Historical_Review) [rnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Historical_Review) [ of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Historical_Review) [ Histori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Historical_Review) [cal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Historical_Review) [ Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Historical_Review) until 2002 but now disseminates its materials through its website and email.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Institute for Historical Review publishes news and information that promotes Holocaust denial, such as this:
[An Imaginary Holocaust May Lead to a Real Holocaust](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v20/v20n6p52_Faurisson.html). In another article, there is more Holocaust denial and support of Nazism: [There is No Evidence for Nazi Gas Chambers](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v17/v17n4p24_Faurisson.html). At this point, I do not want to read more from this website as it is truly revolting.
Here is what others have said about the IHR. The
[Anti-Defamation League](https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Willis-Carto-Extremism-in-America.pdf) labels IHR as a hate group, as does the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/institute-historical-review). [Auschwitz.org](http://auschwitz.org/en/history/holocaust-denial/the-institute-for-historical-review) labels them a hate group as well as Nazi propagandists.
