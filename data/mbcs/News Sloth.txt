Analysis / Bias
News Sloth does perform original news reporting but rather summarizes news stories and interjects conservative opinions. They often use highly emotional wording such as this
[Bad China, No Donut. Biden’s Approach to China’s Microsoft Hack is Pathetic](http://newssloth.com/2021/07/24/bad-china-no-donut-bidens-approach-to-chinas-microsoft-hack-is-pathetic/). This story is completely unsourced. In another story, [It’s All Fun and Games Until the Radical Dems Bring COVID to DC](http://newssloth.com/2021/07/23/its-all-fun-and-games-until-the-radical-dems-bring-covid-to-dc/); they also do not source this article despite making claims that require it.
While all of News Sloth’s articles favor the right, they also promote conspiracy theories related to election fraud, such as this
[AZ Audit Results Are Coming In](http://newssloth.com/2021/07/21/az-audit-results-are-coming-in/). This article reports on the debunked duplicate ballot theory and a revisiting of SharpieGate and the bleeding marker. All of this is debunked [here](https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/debunking-trumps-latest-arizona-election-claims/). Editorially, they support former President Trump and often report his false and/or exaggerated claims [Donald Trump Is Proven Right Yet Again Regarding Democratic Takeover of America](http://newssloth.com/2021/07/15/donald-trump-is-proven-right-yet-again-regarding-democratic-takeover-of-america/). In general, this appears to be an anonymous opinion site that strongly favors the right and rarely sources their claims.
