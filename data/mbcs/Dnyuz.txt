History
DNyuz is an Armenian website that plagiarizes content word for word from major news sources. They literally copy and paste entire articles and embed their advertising code for profit. As one can imagine, a source like this completely lacks transparency as there is zero information to be found about authors, owners, location, or mission.
Since November 2019, the
[Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-retort/) has been linking to this website presumably to bypass paywalls on major news sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). [According](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/drudge-report-links-site-plagiarizes-stories) to a [Buzzfeed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/buzzfeed/) report, Dnyuz was founded and is run by “Hayk Karapetyan, a web developer living in Armenia.” They further report that Drudge has driven 8 million page views to DNyuz from November 2019 through May 2020.

Funded by / Ownership
DNyuz lacks transparency and does not disclose that Hayk Karapetyan is the owner. Revenue is derived through advertising. After the Buzzfeed report, Google Adsense dropped DNyuz, and they have moved to other third-party advertisers such as Infolinks.
Analysis / Bias
In review, DNyuz does not publish original content but rather copies and pastes (plagiarizes) content from major news sources. The stories are copied verbatim from headline to article content. For example, this is a story from Fox News
[Trump says Dems’ ‘war on cops’ puts’ police lives in danger,’ calls for end to Biden’s ‘anti-police crusade’](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-biden-police-jacksonville) is identical in every way to the one published by DNyuz [Trump says Dems’ ‘war on cops’ puts ‘police lives in danger,’ calls for end to Biden’s ‘anti-police crusade](https://dnyuz.com/2020/09/25/trump-says-dems-war-on-cops-puts-police-lives-in-danger-calls-for-end-to-bidens-anti-police-crusade/).’ At the bottom of the plagiarized article, they mention that it came from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). Another article is copied directly from [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) [Toddler Shoots 12-Year-Old Cousin After Finding Gun On Bed.](https://dnyuz.com/2020/09/25/toddler-shoots-12-year-old-cousin-after-finding-gun-on-bed/) We found plagiarized sources are the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), and [International Business Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/international-business-times/). A review of sources they copy reveals more favor the right, with some having poor track records with fact-checkers.
