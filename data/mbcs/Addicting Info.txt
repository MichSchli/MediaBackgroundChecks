Analysis / Bias
In review, Addicting Info always reports stories that favor the left and utilizes strong, emotional, sensationalized headlines such as this:
[GOP Candidate Wants To Dumb Down America By Eliminating Department Of Education.](http://addictinginfo.com/2018/10/24/gop-candidate-wants-to-dumb-down-america-by-eliminating-department-of-education/) The article itself also contains highly emotional wording such as this: “The GOP’s battle to destroy everything that’s great about America is gaining more momentum than ever the longer Pres. Donald Trump and his ilk are running the country. The latest effort by a GOP candidate: make Americans and North Carolinians dumber by eliminating the Department of Education (DOE).” Although this story is highly biased against the right it is properly sourced. In reviewing multiple articles, most follow the same format of a clickbait headline that leads to an emotionally charged article that is sourced from factual information. In general, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right.
