Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered by journalists with proper sourcing and minimal loaded words such as this:
[Police end Stephon Clark protest in East Sacramento with arrest of 84 people](https://www.modbee.com/news/state/california/article227116519.html). National and world news is covered by the McClatchy network.
Editorially, the Modbee tends to lean slightly left and endorse slightly more Democratic candidates, but overall there is balanced.
