History
Founded in 1946 as Jewish Life,
[Jewish Currents](https://jewishcurrents.org/about) is a progressive secular magazine that has undergone significant changes throughout history. Initially affiliated with [communism](https://www.timesofisrael.com/72-year-old-left-wing-magazine-jewish-currents-aims-for-millennials/), the magazine supported a non-Zionist approach to [Israel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/). However, it shifted to democratic socialism and started covering [US-Soviet détente, Palestinian self-determination, and the civil rights movement](https://jewishcurrents.org/history). In 1958, it was renamed Jewish Currents and became a platform for progressive Jewish thought. The magazine was revitalized in 2005 when it started publishing online. In 2018, it was relaunched by millennials, and it now covers politics, culture, and social issues within the Jewish community. Jewish Currents is based in Brooklyn, NY.

Analysis / Bias
The magazine’s reporting and commentary are rooted in progressive values, evident in its choice of topics and angles, providing a counterpoint to conservative Jewish media. However, this ideological position shapes its content, as seen in reports like
[“Biden’s Legacy Will Be Apartheid,”](https://jewishcurrents.org/bidens-legacy-will-be-apartheid) which critiques the administration’s handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict using emotionally loaded language. For instance, phrases such as “mildest of rebukes” and “defaulting to maintenance of a bygone US-Israel alliance,” as well as phrases like “Israel’s extremist right-wing government” and “gutting the power of the Israeli Supreme Court,” can influence the reader’s emotional response and potentially obscure a more objective analysis.
Despite some limitations, the report raises valid questions about the effectiveness of Biden’s approach, the future of US-Israeli relations, and the prospects for peace in the region. The report is supported by factual information and credible sources such as
[Reuters,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) [Axios,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/) [CNN,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/) [Haaretz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/haaretz/), and [Times of Israel.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-israel/) However, relying solely on critical voices, like Yousef Munayyer and Zaha Hassan, can lead to an unbalanced representation.
Like many ideologically oriented publications, Jewish Currents might sometimes prioritize advocacy over a neutral presentation of facts. However, it seems committed to informed and thoughtful analysis, often backed by research and interviews with experts or activists in the field.
For example, an article titled
[“Even as We Are Trying to Help, We Are Being Attacked”](https://jewishcurrents.org/humanitarian-aid-workers-gaza-dispatches) provides perspectives from three humanitarian workers in Gaza, detailing the challenges they face in delivering aid amid the ongoing conflict. The article primarily focuses on the experiences and challenges humanitarian workers face in Gaza. Although the article emphasizes the difficulties faced by these workers, it lacks perspectives from Israeli authorities or individuals, which could offer insights into their motivations and challenges in dealing with the situation in Gaza. Including such perspectives could provide a more balanced view of the conflict.
In general, Jewish Currents is a progressive magazine that offers leftist insights and analyses on issues affecting the Jewish community. It emphasizes social justice and human rights, making it a notable voice in Jewish media.
