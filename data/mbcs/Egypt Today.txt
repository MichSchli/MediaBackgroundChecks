Analysis / Bias
Currently, former General
[Abdel Fattah al-Sisi](https://www.dw.com/en/egypts-parliament-clears-the-way-for-president-abdel-fattah-el-sissi-to-stay-in-power-until-2030/a-48360835) is the President of Egypt. [Al-Sisi](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/07/egypt-morsi-nationalist-general-sisi) is known as a militaristic nationalist.
In review, Egypt Today publishes articles in favor of Al-Sisi; for example, in the article
[“Sisi previews human rights in Egypt with ACHPR.”](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/2/68702/Sisi-previews-human-rights-in-Egypt-with-ACHPR) However, they do not indicate the criticism he faces regarding human rights abuses often [mentioned](https://www.dw.com/en/under-al-sisi-thousands-are-imprisoned/av-49098578) by western human rights organizations and [media](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/437782-congress-should-use-its-leverage-over-egypts-al-sisi-on) such as [Human Rights Watch:](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/) [“Egypt: Year of Abuses Under al-Sisi](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/08/egypt-year-abuses-under-al-sisi).” Furthermore, Egypt Today often [sources](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/3/71864/GACIC-head-Egypt-s-business-delegation-to-visit-Germany-next) to [MENA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA_(news)) or Middle East News Agency, which is a government-run news agency based in Egypt. Finally, most articles completely lack sourced information and are written by Egypt Today Staff providing a name or bio.
When it comes to news pertaining to the USA, in particular the former Trump administration, they use a positive tone
[“Sisi to meet Trump for fifth time in 2 years.”](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/2/58020/Sisi-to-meet-Trump-for-fifth-time-in-2-years) In general, Egypt Today has minimal freedom to report the news accurately and therefore promotes [pro-Government propaganda](https://www.dw.com/en/egypt-media-is-a-propaganda-machine/a-17288479).
