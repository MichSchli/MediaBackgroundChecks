Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Banter reports news and opinion with a very strong liberal bias that frequently uses charged loaded wording such as this:
[Eddie Haskell’s State Of The Union Was An Infuriating Study In Gaslighting](https://thedailybanter.com/2019/02/07/eddie-haskells-state-of-the-union/) and this [Trump Described By U.S. Intelligence Officials As Willfully Ignorant](https://thedailybanter.com/2019/02/03/trump-willfully-ignorant/). Both of these stories are properly sourced. In general, all stories strongly favor the left and denigrate the right through one sided reporting.
On February 11, 2019, the Daily Banter ceased web publishing and have moved to an email model. However, the website is still available to view.
