History
[Launched in 2022](https://whois.domaintools.com/theflstandard.com), The Florida Standard is a conservative news and opinion website focused on Florida and national news. According to their [about page](https://www.theflstandard.com/about/), “The Florida Standard will right-size the Florida media environment. We are a content and reporting machine rooted in truth, deep policy fluency, and a commitment to an informed public.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Florida Standard lacks transparency as they do not clearly state who owns them.
[Will Witt](https://www.theflstandard.com/author/will/) is listed as the Editor-in-Chief and is the presumed owner. Mr. Witt claims to be a “national bestselling author and international speaker.” He also is the host of [PragerU’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/) Man on the Street [Podcast](https://www.prageru.com/presenters/will-witt). The website does not appear monetized now, and funding is not straightforward.
Analysis / Bias
The Florida Standard features writers who report on news stories from other sources. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording that favors the right such as this
[Air DeSantis: Florida Jets Illegal Immigrants to Idyllic Martha’s Vineyard](https://www.theflstandard.com/air-desantis-florida-jets-illegal-immigrants-to-idyllic-marthas-vineyard/). In another article, [Martha’s Vineyard Kicks Out Illegal Immigrants After Less Than 48 Hours](https://www.theflstandard.com/marthas-vineyard-kicks-out-illegal-immigrants-after-less-than-48-hours/); they rely on [NBC Boston](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wbts-nbc10-boston-bias/) and the Florida Voice. Regarding sourcing, we have found that they usually utilize credible sources in Florida, such as the [Orlando Sentinel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/orlando-sentinel/) and [St. Augustine Record](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/st-augustine-record-bias/).
Editorially, The Florida Standard appropriately labels opinion content that always favors the right such as this
[Deceptive Democrats and the Bidenflation Scam Act](https://www.theflstandard.com/deceptive-democrats-and-the-bidenflation-scam-act/). We also found that they have promoted Covid-19 misinformation in the article [Massacre: Nearly Half of Pregnant Women in Pfizer Trial Miscarried](https://www.theflstandard.com/massacre-nearly-half-of-pregnant-women-in-pfizer-trial-miscarried/?fbclid=IwAR13tunlEKAOEOTwbAILqOzmYi62lYmvL9_YHhFaSVVd5_UbfwwG7lGTbo8). This story relies on sources that frequently advance Covid-19 conspiracy theories, such as Naomi Wolfe, [American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), and Steve Kirsch. According to IFCN fact checker [Lead Stories](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2022/08/fact-check-misscarriage-rate-not-44-percent-for-women-in-pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial.html), “Naomi Wolf incorrectly analyzed public information when claiming that “out of 50 pregnant women, 22 of them lost their babies.” Wolf and two publishers have all retracted the claim.” However, The Florida Standard did not retract or correct the article.
Further, they also published another misleading story regarding Covid-19 vaccines titled
[Vaccine Narrative Collapses as Harvard Study Shows Jab More Dangerous than COVID](https://www.theflstandard.com/vaccine-narrative-collapses-as-harvard-study-shows-jab-more-dangerous-than-covid/). [Lead Stories](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lead-stories/) also [refuted this story](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2022/09/fact-check-covid-vaccines-are-not-98-times-worse-than-the-virus.html). This story relies on the questionable [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/) and [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) for analysis.
Rather than correcting the misinformation, The Florida Standard doubled down and attacked the fact-checker
[Florida Standard Story on Vaccine Study Censored by Gates and Soros-Linked “Fact Checkers.”](https://www.theflstandard.com/florida-standard-story-on-vaccine-study-suppressed-by-gates-and-soros-linked-fact-checkers/) In general, most news is reported factually; however, there is evidence that they rely on poor sources and promote Covid-19 conspiracy theories.
