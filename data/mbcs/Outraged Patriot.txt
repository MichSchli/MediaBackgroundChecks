Analysis / Bias
In review, Outraged Patriot does not produce original news reporting but rather republishes or summarizes other news stories. Story selection always favors the right and uses loaded emotional wording such as this
[BREAKING: Bill Barr Just Broke The Democrats. Incredible.](https://outragedpatriot.com/boom-bill-barr-goes-on-the-attack-this-is-war/) This story comes from the Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), which has an abysmal record with fact-checkers. In fact, most news stories on this website originate from very poor sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [Daily Conservative](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-daily-news/), [The Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/), and [Big League Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-league-politics/).
Although they do not offer editorials, their story selection indicates a far-right bias that frequently promotes false information regarding the Coronavirus and consistent praise for the former Trump administration:
[BREAKING: Trump Was Right – COVID-19 Lie Exposed!](https://outragedpatriot.com/breaking-trump-was-right-covid-19-lie-exposed/) In general, Outraged Patriot does not always publish factual news and holds an extreme right bias.
Failed Fact Checks
- They do not produce original content and therefore have not been fact-checked; however, the sources they use generally have poor track records with numerous failed fact checks.
