Analysis / Bias
IslamiCity covers various Islamic topics and offers educational resources on the
[Quran,](https://www.islamicity.org/quran/) [Hadith](https://www.islamicity.org/hadith/), and Islamic practice. An example article, [‘Does Allah Misguide Anyone?’](https://www.islamicity.org/22570/does-allah-misguide-anyone/) by Mansoor Alam, explores the concept of Allah’s guidance and human free will with references to Quranic verses.
The website also addresses global news and often discusses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, offering perspectives that often relate to the interests and concerns of the Muslim community. For instance, when covering the conflict, they reflect a viewpoint sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. For example, the article titled
[“Political Dynamics: Israeli Aggression in Gaza vs. West Bank Realities”](https://www.islamicity.org/97511/political-dynamics-israeli-aggression-in-gaza-vs-west-bank-realities/) by Dr. Ramzy Baroud critiques the escalation in the West Bank and Gaza, attributing it to Israeli policies and settler actions. The article links the violence increase to political shifts in Israel, especially the rise of far-right influence. A quote from the article reads, “far-right ministers in the extremist government of Benjamin Netanyahu, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, are themselves settlers.” Various sources, including [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Al Jazeera,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/) UN.org, [Yahoo News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/), [The Hindu](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hindu/), and [Middle East Monitor](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/middle-east-monitor/), are cited, but the article leans towards a Palestinian viewpoint. Including these sources with varying levels of factual accuracy (rated by MBFC), from high to mixed, adds complexity to the article’s overall credibility and objectivity.
Further, we also analyzed articles that explore the political dynamics surrounding
[Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and his impact on different religious communities.
The first article,
[“Trump May Lose, But Trumpism Lives On,”](https://www.islamicity.org/97520/trump-may-lose-but-trumpism-lives-on/) critically examines Donald Trump’s influence within the Republican Party and his broader impact on American political culture. The author, James Zogby, articulates a strong critique of Trump, describing him with terms that carry significant negative connotations, such as “pathological narcissist” and “inciter to violence.” This choice of language suggests a clear editorial stance and introduces an element of emotional bias into the narrative. Despite this, the article contextualizes Trump’s popularity by linking it to historical and social developments shaping American political discourse. However, it lacks direct evidence or citations to support these connections.
In contrast, the second article,
[“The Religious Supporters and Opponents of Donald Trump,”](https://www.islamicity.org/66319/the-religious-supporters-and-opponents-of-donald-trump/) penned by Rabbi Allen S. Maller, adopts a more data-driven approach. It presents detailed statistics and findings from various polls to illustrate the complex landscape of Trump’s support among different religious groups, including American Muslims and Ultra-Orthodox Jews. By grounding its analysis in specific data points, the article provides a factual basis for its discussion, which helps to counterbalance the potential for bias. However, the broad categorizations of entire religious communities could risk oversimplifying the diverse range of political views within these groups.
Regarding sourcing, the article mentions
[the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding](https://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Appendix-III.-Data-tables.pdf), an American Muslim survey organization. It also references other sources such as [Pew Research Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/) and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)/ [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/). However, these sources are not hyperlinked, making verifying the mentioned polls difficult.
In general, IslamiCity is a comprehensive online resource for the global Muslim community, offering a mix of religious teachings, including pseudoscience related to
[creation and evolution](https://www.islamicity.org/81679/creation-6-days-or-billions-of-years/), news, and perspectives on contemporary issues.
