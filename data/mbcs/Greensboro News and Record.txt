Analysis / Bias
In review, The Greensboro News & Record covers local news through journalists with minimal bias, such as this:
[Man wanted in Nov. 11 robbery, vehicle chase in High Point arrested in Wilmington, police say](https://www.greensboro.com/news/crime/man-wanted-in-nov-robbery-vehicle-chase-in-high-point/article_0c4e9e84-c9b8-52df-8586-012be6e79d32.html). National and international news is derived from the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and other wire services.
Editorially, the News & Record has
[endorsed](https://noahveltman.com/endorsements/) Democratic presidential candidates since 1984, including Hillary Clinton in 2016. [Editorial columns](https://www.greensboro.com/opinion/editorials/) and op-eds also tend to slightly favor the left, though both voices are represented. In general, they report news factually with a slightly left-leaning bias editorially.
