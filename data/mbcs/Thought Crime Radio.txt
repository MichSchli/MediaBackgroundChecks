Analysis / Bias
Thought Crime Radio is an overt Conspiracy and Pseudoscience website. They routinely publish
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) from other pseudoscience sources such as this: [STUDIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. SHOW UNVACCINATED CHILDREN HEALTHIER THAN VACCINATED CHILDREN](http://thoughtcrimeradio.net/2018/03/studies-outside-the-u-s-show-unvaccinated-children-healthier-than-vaccinated-children/). The source for this article is the fiercely anti-vaccine [Health Impact News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-impact-news/). Thought Crime Radio also publishes numerous [9-11 conspiracies](http://thoughtcrimeradio.net/category/9-11/) and [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) and False Flag operations. TCR also frequently uses poor sources such as the right-wing conspiracy site [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). If it is a conspiracy, it is on this website.
In this review for 2022, we find nothing has changed as they still publish false information such as this
[GOFUNDME BLOCKS MILLIONS RAISED FOR TRUCKERS PROTESTING VAX MANDATES](http://thoughtcrimeradio.net/2022/01/gofundme-blocks-millions-raised-for-truckers-protesting-vax-mandates/). [This story is not true](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/freedom-convoy-guinness/). In general, Thought Crime Radio is a crackpot conspiracy and pseudoscience website that favors an extreme right bias.
