Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hoover Institution publishes research that almost always favors the right such as this:
[A Progressive Plan That Aids Loan Sharks](https://www.hoover.org/research/progressive-plan-aids-loan-sharks). Although this is classified as research, a review demonstrates an opinion piece that is not strongly sourced—most articles on this website link to other sources rather than original writing from Hoover. Hoover links articles to various left-leaning sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [San Jose Mercury News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-jose-mercury-news/), and [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/). They also link to right-leaning sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), [Wall St. Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/).
In general, Hoover Institution supports a free market economy and holds Libertarian positions regarding gay marriage and abortion. Although the Hoover Institution sometimes presents a
[skeptical](https://www.hoover.org/research/obsolete-climate-science) view of [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they also link to articles like this: [Doing Nothing About Climate Change The Most Expensive Option](https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/columns/4611807-local-view-doing-nothing-about-climate-change-most-expensive-option).
