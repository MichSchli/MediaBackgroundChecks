In review, Spiegel Online (Der Spiegel) covers a wide range of news from politics, sports, business to tech and science. Articles and headlines feature moderately loaded wording such as this
[ Monitoring the Right Wing German Officials Seek to Turn up the Heat on the AfD](https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/monitoring-the-right-wing-german-officials-seek-to-turn-up-the-heat-on-the-afd-a-c44c0a38-ee6b-4dc1-ac94-9fbee59b706f). Articles are written by reporters and often feature investigations and first-person accounts.
Editorially, there is a reasonable balance between right and left, however, in our review more favored the left with features called
[“Climate Crisis.”](https://www.spiegel.de/thema/klimawandel/) In general, the news is reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
