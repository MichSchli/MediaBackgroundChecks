In review, The New Statesman reports news and opinions with a left-leaning bias in story selection and wording such as this:
[It is getting harder and harder for Nancy Pelosi to resist calls to impeach Trump](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2019/05/it-getting-harder-and-harder-nancy-pelosi-resist-calls-impeach-trump). Like most on the New Statesman, this story utilizes credible sources such as [Roll Call](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/roll-call/) and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). For the most part, stories are opposed to conservatives, whether it be the US version of the New Statesman or the UK version such as this: [Rory Stewart has said what many Conservative moderates are thinking about Boris Johnson.](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2019/05/rory-stewart-has-said-what-many-conservative-moderates-are-thinking-about) When it comes to UK politics, the New Statesman does not support [Brexit](https://www.newstatesman.com/brexit), and when it comes to US politics, they do not support former [President Trump](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2019/04/why-it-s-so-dangerous-when-trump-describes-abortion-baby-execution). In general, most stories favor the left and denigrate the right.
