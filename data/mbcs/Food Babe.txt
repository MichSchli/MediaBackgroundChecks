History
Founded in 2011,
[Vani Deva Hari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vani_Hari), also known on her blog as the Food Babe, is an American author, activist, and affiliate marketer known for her criticism of the food industry. Hari’s ideas on food safety have been criticized by scientists as pseudoscience and chemophobia, and others have drawn attention to her apparent financial interest through the promotion and marketing of natural foods. According to the [about page](https://foodbabe.com/about-me/), “you can expect to learn the truth about harmful ingredients in processed foods and how to avoid the stuff the food industry is trying to hide!” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Food Babe publishes recipes that are reasonable and safe, as well as news on her blog that routinely publishes pseudoscience and chemical conspiracy theories. Regarding her recipes, they are generally considered healthy; however, the claims made in these recipes may be unrealistic such as this one:
[Papaya Salad with Miso Turmeric Dressing](https://foodbabe.com/papaya-salad-with-miso-turmeric-dressing/). While this does sound healthy and tasty, the claims made are over the top, such as this: “Its star ingredient is the papaya, a tropical fruit that’s very high in vitamin C and loaded with the enzyme papain that helps keep your skin, nails, and hair beautiful!” While papaya is certainly a healthy fruit, eating this recipe will not support the claims made. Further, in this recipe, the Food Babe takes the opportunity to denigrate GMOs, without evidence, as she does frequently on this website: “When shopping for ingredients for this salad, make sure you choose non-GMO papaya, as this is one of the few fresh fruits that are often GMO.”
The blog portion of her website is where pseudoscience is heavily promoted. For example, there are
[natural miracle cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) cures such as this: [Cancer Fighting Cherry Berry Smoothie](https://foodbabe.com/cherry-berry-smoothie/) and very frequent [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) that is not supported by science; CONFIRMED [! Lab tests show over 30+ popular food products contain GMOs. Are you eating them?](https://foodbabe.com/confirmed-lab-tests-show-over-30-popular-food-products-contain-gmos-are-you-eating-them/) She has also promoted [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). In general, Vani Deva Hari is a second-place finisher to [Joseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) but is still dangerous in her claims.
