According to their

Analysis / Bias
The focus of the X22 Report is on the potential for an economic meltdown where inflation drives the cost of goods to unaffordable levels. In fact, X22 provides a
[list of prepping materials](https://x22report.com/prepping-materials/) needed for this collapse. These include food, water, toilet supplies, weapons, ammunition, gold, and silver, etc. X22 also believes that [climate change is a hoax](https://x22report.com/climate-change-the-great-hoax/). The wording of headlines and articles contain only mild loaded words; however, they consistently use questionable sources such as conspiracy theorist [Ben Swann](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/truth-in-media/) and Greg Hunter of [USAWatchdog](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usawatchdog-com/). Many articles strongly favor former President Trump and his conspiracy theories regarding election fraud. See failed fact checks below.
X22 also has a page dedicated to
[Relocations of Unaccompanied Immigrant Minors](https://x22report.com/relocations-of-unaccompanied-immigrant-minors/), which provides a map of where they are most concentrated in the USA. There isn’t a description as to why this map is posted. Do they have sympathy for immigrant minors? Or is it a warning? Based on the comments below the map, it appears that the readers are opposed to immigrants, with some fearing spread of diseases; in general, X22 rates as a far-right conspiracy and pseudoscience website with low credibility. Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Presidential election of 2020, they frequently published [false or misleading information](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/05/fact-check-x22-report-video-does-not-contain-only-true-claims-about-covid-19-2020-election.html).
