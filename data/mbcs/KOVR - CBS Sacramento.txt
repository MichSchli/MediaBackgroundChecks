Analysis / Bias
In review, the CBS Sacramento website publishes sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and local news for the greater Sacramento region through
[CBSN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/). Local news articles and headlines use minimal emotionally loaded wording such as this: [Armed Standoff In Rancho Cordova Ends Peacefully](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2021/01/15/armed-knife-best-western-plus-rancho-cordova/). A video accompanies most stories from the TV station. National news stories are published by other [CBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) affiliates and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, CBS Sacramento does not publish op-eds; however, they do report on politics with slightly more stories favoring the left such as this
[Sacramento Man Resigns From Position In California Republican Assembly After Involvement In Capitol Riot](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2021/01/15/jorge-riley-resigns-california-republican-assembly/) and this [Pelosi Calls Trump ‘Imminent Threat’ To Democracy, House To Proceed With Impeachment Legislation](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2021/01/10/pelosi-trump-house-impeachment/). The news is generally reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias when covering politics.
