Analysis / Bias
The Western Journal is a news and opinion website with a story selection that always favors the right and is negative toward the left. There is the frequent use of moderately loaded language in headlines such as this:
[The Clinton State Department’s Major Security Breach That Everyone Is Ignoring.](https://www.westernjournal.com/the-clinton-state-departments-major-security-breach-that-everyone-is-ignoring/) The Western Journal typically sources its information from credible media outlets, though story selection and wording usually spin information favorably to the right. They have also failed several fact checks.
Finally, during the 2020 Presidential election, they have promoted misinformation. They also consistently promote misinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. See failed fact check below.
