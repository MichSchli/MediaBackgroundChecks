History
The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) was started as an American non-profit organization founded in 1996 by magician and skeptic James Randi. The JREFâ€™s mission includes educating the public and the media on the dangers of accepting unproven claims and supporting research into paranormal claims in controlled scientific experimental conditions.
The organization administered the
[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Dollar_Paranormal_Challenge), which offered a prize of one million U.S. dollars to anyone who could demonstrate a supernatural or paranormal ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria. The award has never been given out to date.
On 10/21/2020 James Randi passed away, but the website and foundation continue on.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The James Randi Educational Foundation primarily serves as a grant-making foundation in 2021. They make grants of up to $100K per year to non-profit groups that they believe are promoting activities that encourage critical thinking and a fact-based world view. Currently, the website only displays news about the foundation such as this
[2022 JREF Award](https://web.randi.org/home/2020-jref-award). In general, the website is idle, but JREF is still giving out grants to pro-science nonprofits.
