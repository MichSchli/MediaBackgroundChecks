Analysis / Bias
As a website dedicated to firearms-related topics, concealednation.org tends to present information from a pro-Second Amendment perspective. The articles often highlight stories of self-defense, legal cases related to firearms, and topics relevant to concealed carry permit holders. It is important to note that the website’s content is geared towards promoting responsible firearm ownership and self-defense practices.
Articles and headlines use minimally loaded wording and often focus on alleged crimes being stopped by guns, such as this
[Woman Shot While Reportedly Attempting To Break Into Home](https://concealednation.org/2023/07/woman-shot-while-reportedly-attempting-to-break-into-home/). This story, like most others on the website, relies on credible local news sources such as [NBC Chicago](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-chicago-wmaq-bias/).
Editorially most stories favor a conservative perspective advocating for 2nd amendment rights, such as this
[Things That Pro-2nd Amendment People Are Tired Of Hearing](https://concealednation.org/2013/12/things-that-pro-2nd-amendment-people-are-tired-of-hearing/). They also view Democrats unfavorably like this [North Dakota Expands Places You Can Carry Concealed, One Democrat Has Some Things To Say That Make No Sense](https://concealednation.org/2015/04/north-dakota-expands-places-you-can-carry-concealed-one-democrat-has-some-things-to-say-that-make-no-sense/). In general, Concealed Nation is fact-based and holds moderate-right-leaning political biases.
