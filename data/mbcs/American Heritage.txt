History
Founded in 1949, American Heritage is a magazine dedicated to covering the history of the United States of America for a mainstream readership. According to their
[about page](https://www.americanheritage.com/about/company), The mission of American Heritage remains similar to what its early editors outlined in 1950: “To develop a deeper understanding of the American heritage… [and] act as a clearinghouse for all information.”
In 2013, the
[print publication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heritage_(magazine)) was suspended, and it became a fully digital magazine. The current editor-in-chief is Edwin S. Grosvenor.

Analysis / Bias
In review, American Heritage publishes information on American history written in an easy-to-read style. Headlines and wording are often low-biased and well-written, such as this:
[What Does the Second Amendment Really Mean](https://www.americanheritage.com/what-does-second-amendment-really-mean)? This story is properly sourced and fairly presents both sides. It is in-depth and informative. Editorially, American Heritage rarely reports on current politics, such as this editorial criticizing former President Obama and especially former President Donald Trump for their cuts to history programs: [Stop the War on History](https://www.americanheritage.com/stop-war-history).
A quote from the article reads, “Now the Trump Administration has proposed budget cuts of truly catastrophic proportions for the history community, including a 72% cut to the National Endowment for the Humanities, with plans for its eventual demise.” In general, American Heritage reports factually and with minimal bias.
