Analysis / Bias
The Ringer occasionally publishes news and commentary related to politics, which we will cover for this review.
The Ringer uses moderately loaded words in their headlines, such as this:
[The Case for Indicting Donald Trump](https://www.theringer.com/2022/10/18/23409704/the-case-for-indicting-donald-trump). In another article titled: [“Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un, and the Art of the Raw Deal](https://www.theringer.com/2018/6/11/17452192/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-g7-conference-justin-trudeau),” there is loaded language used in the body of the article “The president may have made major diplomatic strides in Singapore while almost simultaneously insulting our closest allies. Is Trump trolling the world?” Regarding sourcing, The Ringer usually uses credible sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [AP News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), and the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). In general, most political stories favor the left while being critical of the right.
