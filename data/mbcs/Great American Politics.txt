Analysis / Bias
In review, Great American Politics fully disclaims they are a conservative website and the articles published reflect that. News articles tend to utilize sensational emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[Joe Biden Says Despicable Things About America While Speaking In Europe](https://greatamericanpolitics.com/2019/02/joe-biden-says-despicable-things-about-america-while-speaking-in-europe/) and [Mexico Governor Has Strong Message For Migrants; Leftists Will Hate This](https://greatamericanpolitics.com/2019/02/mexico-governor-has-strong-message-for-migrants-leftists-will-hate-this/). Sourcing for articles comes from a wide variety of right leaning sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) and the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), and questionable sources such as [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), both of which have poor track records with fact checkers. In general, Great American Politics takes a news story from a known media source and editorializes, it to fit a conservative narrative. All stories on this website favor the right and denigrate the left.
