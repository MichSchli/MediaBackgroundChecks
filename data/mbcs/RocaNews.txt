Analysis / Bias
In review, RocaNews summarizes news stories in just a few sentences in the categories politics, sports, business, world, science, and happy hour, which appear to be random stories that do not easily fit into a classification. Articles and headlines utilize low biased wording such as this
[US to hit 100M vaccines today; EU green-lights vaccine](https://www.rocanews.com/news-hits/us-to-hit-100m-vaccines-today-eu-green-lights-vaccine). When it comes to the sourcing of information, they don’t. Not at all. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where the news information is coming from.
Editorially, RocaNews does not publish op-eds; however, they do publish political news that is generally low-biased and does not appear to favor either side. In general, the news is reported with minimal bias and appears factual; however, it is impossible to check without sourcing.
