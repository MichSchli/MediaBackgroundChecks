Analysis / Bias
Breakthrough News prioritizes stories affecting poor and working-class communities. For example, the video
[“United Auto Workers Stand Up for Working Class in Historic Strike” ](https://breakthroughnews.org/united-auto-workers-stand-up-for-working-class-in-historic-strike/)features an interview with Denny Butler, the Vice President of UAW Local 685. The title suggests a focus on the actions and solidarity of the United Auto Workers (UAW) in their efforts to advocate for the rights and interests of the working class. The interview does not present counterpoints from the auto companies or other stakeholders, suggesting a clear editorial choice to highlight the workers’ viewpoint.
The framing of the conversation leans towards a pro-labor stance. There is an absence of opposing perspectives or critical analysis of the workers’ demands or the broader economic context. The interviewer’s questions and comments support the interviewee’s points, indicating a bias towards the workers’ perspective. Here are specific instances from the transcript:
“The interviewer’s acknowledgment of workers’ struggle”
At around the 0:24 mark, the interviewer acknowledges the impending deadline and the need for workers to take action, setting a tone of urgency and support for the workers’ cause.
“Query about worker conditions”
Around 1:24, the interviewer asks Butler to lay out the conditions the average worker has to deal with, prompting a response highlighting the workers’ struggles.
“Discussion of past sacrifices”
At approximately 2:21, the interviewer brings up the concessions made by auto workers during the 2008-2009 economic crisis, framing it as a past sacrifice that warrants current acknowledgment and compensation.
“Question about electric vehicles as a smokescreen”
Near the 5:49 mark, the interviewer suggests that the rhetoric around transitioning to electric vehicles might be a smokescreen for eliminating workers or moving factories, which aligns with the perspective of labor challenges in the industry. These instances from the interview show how the interviewer’s approach supports the narrative of the workers’ struggles and challenges, aligning with a pro-labor perspective.
Breakthrough News primarily features videos; in analyzing Breakthrough News’ video headlines on the
[Russia and Ukraine](https://breakthroughnews.org/?s=Ukraine) conflict, their headlines strongly advocate for peace and diplomacy over military actions, such as” ‘An Unwinnable War’: The Urgent Need for Peace in Ukraine with Medea Benjamin” and” ‘Send Diplomats, Not Weapons’: German MP Speaks Out Against Ukraine War.” Additionally, they often critique Western policies, as seen in headlines such as “Zelensky in Washington: U.S. Prepares to Escalate Ukraine War” and “Is the U.S. Proxy War in Ukraine Making Europe Poorer? with Tarik Cyril Amar.” This reporting style challenges mainstream Western narratives, emphasizes the negative consequences of the conflict and offers a platform for alternative viewpoints sympathetic to Russia or critical of NATO and U.S. policies.
While presenting factually accurate information in certain instances, Breakthrough News exhibits a notable pattern in its reporting style, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For example, the video titled” ‘
[An Unwinnable War’: The Urgent Need for Peace in Ukraine with Medea Benjamin”](https://breakthroughnews.org/an-unwinnable-war-the-urgent-need-for-peace-in-ukraine-w-medea-benjamin/) accurately states that President Biden asked for an additional [$24 billion for Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/10/us/politics/biden-ukraine-aid.html), on top of the $113 billion already sent since 2022. This claim aligns with information from credible sources such as [The New York Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/)
However, the absence of direct citations or hyperlinks to corroborate their claims can hinder viewers’ ability to independently verify the information, potentially impacting the perceived credibility and transparency of their reporting. In general, this reporting approach, combined with the editorial choices observed in their headlines, suggests a left-leaning pro-Russian editorial stance, particularly in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
