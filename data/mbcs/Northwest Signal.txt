Analysis / Bias
The Northwest Signal publishes local news through the use of local journalists. Local news uses minimally loaded wording like this
[Subject charged in hit-skip crash](https://www.northwestsignal.net/news/article_4e91197c-cd17-5608-9bf9-01a5ddfe2c6d.html). The website does not cover national news.
Editorially, the Northwest Signal leans right in its views through the consistent publication of op-eds and news from a Christian perspective,
[Bishop Thomas participated in consecration](https://www.northwestsignal.net/news/article_fc695486-82f5-50d1-9a78-6e70ae26c486.html). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
