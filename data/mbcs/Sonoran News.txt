Analysis / Bias
Sonoran News is conservative editorially as their tagline is: “The Conservative Voice of Arizona.”
Under the Opinion section, there are “My View, Letters, and Guest editorials subsections.”
[This example](http://sonorannews.com/2017/09/12/exploiting-fault-lines-islamic-terrorism/) is from a guest editor, in which the headline and the article utilizes loaded words but does not provide any sourcing to support the information presented. Under the My View section, another article doesn’t give a source and then republishes from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) with no other references provided.
