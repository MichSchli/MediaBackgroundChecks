Analysis / Bias
In review, Prevention Magazine produces original content on health and wellness. They provide health advice through short articles and occasionally listicles. Headlines and wording are often low-biased, such as: Does
[ Wearing Gloves Reduce Your COVID-19 Risk?](https://www.prevention.com/health/a31400700/does-wearing-gloves-prevent-coronavirus/) This story is properly sourced to the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/). While Prevention Magazine will never be accused of being a hard science source, they do support [pro-science points](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) of view on [vaccinations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and [climate change](https://www.prevention.com/search/?q=climate+change).
However, when it comes to
[GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), they frequently publish [alarmist articles](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) that do not align with the consensus of science. For example, in this story, “ [Need Another Reason To Avoid GMOs?”](https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a20434463/animal-study-links-gmos-to-cancer/) the website promotes the [debunked](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/gmwatch-anti-biotech-news-hub-goal-is-to-remove-all-gmo-crops-and-food/) 2012 study by [Gilles-Éric Séralini,](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/gilles-eric-seralini-activist-professor-face-anti-gmo-industry/) which was retracted from the Food and Chemical Toxicology Journal the “following year after a detailed review following criticism from scientists and regulatory bodies, which found a pattern of bias and design flaws. The study used cancer-prone rats, shoddy controls, and the data cherry-picked (e.g., data showed some rats fed glyphosate had few tumors, which the authors did not highlight in their commentary).” This story has remained on the website since 2012.
Finally, Prevention Magazine promotes fad diets like this:
[This Man Ate Only Potatoes for 1 Year and Lost 117 Pounds](https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30786302/can-the-potato-diet-help-you-lose-weight-safely/). While they question the safety of a potato-only diet, the article mainly highlights the benefits of a diet that is not nutritionally balanced.
From an editorial standpoint, Prevention does not cover politics; however, they frequently cover the lifestyles of people associated with the left, such as Michelle Obama and Al Gore.
In general, most information is factual; however, as indicated above, there are instances where they stray from the consensus of science.
