[Cunningham no longer with Amherst school system](https://www.amherstbulletin.com/Amherst-Assistant-Superintendent-Doreen-Cunningham-leaves-district-employment-52754603). The paper and website do not cover national and international news.
Editorially, a review of articles classified as “commentary” indicates more favor a left-leaning perspective, such as
