Analysis / Bias
The Alternative Daily primarily publishes health and wellness articles from an alternative or holistic perspective. While many articles are properly sourced to credible outlets such as the
[CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) and peer-reviewed journals, others are not. For example, they promote unproven cancer cures such as this [6 Peruvian Cures For Cancer, Inflammation, Staph Infections And More](https://www.thealternativedaily.com/6-peruvian-cures-for-infections) and [A Mother’s Son Was Dying From Cancer, So She Secretly Gave Him This](https://www.thealternativedaily.com/a-mothers-son-was-dying-from-cancer-so-she-secretly-gave-him-cannabis/). This last article claims that a cannabis tincture cured terminal cancer. While cannabis may be beneficial for symptom treatment, there is [zero evidence](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cannabis-pdq) that it can cure cancer.
Alternative Daily has also promoted anti-vaccination propaganda, such as advancing the idea that vaccines cause autism
[Report: Monkeys Subjected To Vaccines Develop Symptoms of Autism](https://www.thealternativedaily.com/report-monkeys-subjected-to-vaccines-develop-symptoms-of-autism/). There is no connection between vaccines and [autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/) in humans. Finally, they promoted misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic by claiming that Oregano Oil can kill viruses on surfaces [Antibacterial Wipes are Sold Out: How to Make Your Own.](https://www.thealternativedaily.com/antibacterial-wipes-sold-out-how-make-your-own/) According to [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) Fact Check, this claim is [false](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-herbs-and-spices-treat-viru/false-claim-12-herbs-and-spices-can-prevent-or-treat-different-viruses-idUSKCN229214). In general, Alternative Daily publishes a mix of credible news and quackery level pseudoscience.
