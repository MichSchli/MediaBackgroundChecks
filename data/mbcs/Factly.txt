Analysis / Bias
Factly’s content focuses on data journalism and fact-checking. It aims to present facts with evidence, simplifying complex public data and debunking viral misinformation. Factly sources its information from publicly available sources such as government websites and responses to Right to Information applications.
Our analysis of several Factly articles, including an article titled
[“BJP is the beneficiary of 65% of all Electoral Bonds redeemed by end of 2020-21,”](https://factly.in/data-bjp-is-the-beneficiary-of-65-of-all-the-electoral-bonds-redeemed-by-end-of-2020-21/) provides a neutral, data-focused analysis of Electoral Bond distributions. It utilizes government sources, RTI responses, and political parties’ Annual Audit Reports for data. However, the analysis faces credibility issues due to inaccessible hyperlinks: one leads to the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) website for Annual Audit Reports, and another leads to Factly’s own dashboard on Electoral Bonds, referenced for detailed information on the bonds. However, internal links within Factly’s website referencing related content are functional. This discrepancy in link accessibility impacts the ease of independently verifying the article’s data and the ability to cross-reference or confirm the article’s claims.
Another article,
[“A Doctors Alliance video is falsely shared as WHO Doctors taking a complete U-turn on COVID-19 pandemic,”](https://factly.in/a-doctors-alliance-video-falsely-shared-as-who-doctors-taking-a-complete-u-turn-on-covid-19-pandemic/) addresses misinformation by clarifying that the individuals in the video are not WHO doctors. They utilize reliable sources like [WHO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), [Reuters, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/#google_vignette) [The Lancet](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-lancet/), and [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), the article fact-checks and refutes several incorrect claims about COVID-19.
In the Factly check
[“How Many Times Did a Political Party Secure More Than 50% of The Polled Vote?”,](https://factly.in/many-times-political-party-get-50-votes-2/) the analysis draws on data from the Election Commission of India. However, broken links to source data, similar to the first article, affect the article’s reliability. This issue restricts the ability for independent verification of the information, impacting the overall credibility of the article’s findings.
Factly’s verification as a
[signatory](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/application/public/factly-media-research/04783CA1-72A7-A1BB-498A-5B2B47F3FAE1) of the International Fact-Checking Network’s Code of Principles shows that they are reasonably fact-based; however, Factly’s fact-checking, including cases involving leaders like Modi and Rahul Gandhi, tends to focus on easily verifiable claims, often neglecting deeper analysis of significant statements or policies.
In general, Factly is mostly fact-based and demonstrates minimal bias in fact-check selection; however, the frequency of broken links, especially when linking to government data, impacts their credibility as a fact-checker.
