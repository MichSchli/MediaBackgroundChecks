Funded by / Ownership
ShareAmerica is owned and operated by the
[Bureau of Global Public Affairs](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-public-diplomacy-and-public-affairs/bureau-of-global-public-affairs/) within the [U.S. Department of State](http://www.state.gov/). As a government entity, it is funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars.
Analysis / Bias
ShareAmerica, managed by the U.S. Department of State, presents content that aligns with U.S. government policies and perspectives. For example, the article “
[Exchanging ideas to expand vocational education worldwide”](https://share.america.gov/exchanging-ideas-expand-vocational-education-worldwide/) highlights the U.S. State Department’s program that influences international college administrators by exposing them to U.S. community college practices, potentially shaping vocational education in their home countries.
Further, the
[“Countering Violent Extremism”](https://share.america.gov/theme/theme-global-issues/theme-countering-violent-extremism/) page on ShareAmerica features various articles addressing global efforts to counter violent extremism. These articles predominantly portray the U.S. in a positive light, emphasizing its proactive role in combating extremism. However, while they provide factual information, they often lack an in-depth exploration of the issues’ root causes or broader geopolitical contexts.
For example, the article
[“The U.S. Provides $80 Million in Aid to the Sahel”](https://share.america.gov/us-provides-80-million-aid-sahel/) discusses U.S. emergency aid to the Sahel region, casting the U.S. as a major humanitarian donor. It quotes U.S. officials, “U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,” cites states.gov and the [Associated Press (AP News)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) as sources but lacks an [in-depth analysis](https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/america-ignores-africa-at-its-own-peril/) of the Sahel’s challenges and their root causes.
In conclusion, while the articles provide factual information, their tone and emphasis on U.S. contributions positively portray U.S. efforts. The source is a U.S. Department of State-managed platform, indicating potential bias in favor of U.S. foreign policy objectives. The bias of ShareAmerica changes with each administration. Currently, they hold a left-center bias that is reflective of the current government.
