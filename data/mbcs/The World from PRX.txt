Analysis / Bias
In review, The World from PRX distributes programming to public radio stations. Among its programs is the global news program “The World,” which PRI co-produces with the
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and WGBH Boston. The World from PRX stories mostly come from staff reporting from different locations worldwide and are typically highly factual. Headlines and articles do not use loaded language such as this: [What we know about the new, novel coronavirus: A timeline](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-02-06/what-we-know-about-new-novel-coronavirus-timeline) and this [The US has renewed its support for Venezuela’s opposition. What does it mean?](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-02-07/us-has-renewed-its-support-venezuelas-opposition-what-does-it-mean) These examples are strongly supported by [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/).
Politically, The World from PRX does not offer strong opinions in either direction; however, when reporting on the
[Trump administration](https://www.pri.org/search/google/trump), there tend to be more negative stories by a slight margin. When it comes to [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), PRI aligns with the consensus of science and the political left. The news is generally reported factually and with some left-leaning bias in story selection. All stories are evidence-based.
