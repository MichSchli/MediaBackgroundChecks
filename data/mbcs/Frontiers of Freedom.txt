History
Launched in 1995, Frontiers of Freedom is a right-wing think tank founded by retired Republican senator
[Malcolm Wallop.](https://www.ff.org/about/) Frontiers of Freedom’s mission statement indicates they “promote the principles of individual freedom, peace through strength, limited government, free enterprise, free markets, and traditional American values as found in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” They also explain, “We do this by exposing the truth about state government the mainstream media won’t tell you; by holding elected officials accountable when they support liberal policies; and by persistently fighting to give voice to those who feel they’re not being heard.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
