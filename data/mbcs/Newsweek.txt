History
Thomas J. C. Martyn founded Newsweek in 1933 as a weekly magazine headquartered in New York City. Today,
[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/about-newsweek) is a news magazine and website covering news and analysis, international issues, technology, business, culture, and politics. Newsweek was bought by The Washington Post Company in 1961 and eventually [sold](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080203970.html) to audio magnate Sidney Harman in 2010. [The Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) and Newsweek merged in a joint venture and were named The Newsweek Daily Beast Company, which lasted for 2 years.
In 2013, Etienne Uzac and Johnathan Davis acquired Newsweek and
[IBT Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/international-business-times/), re-branding themselves as Newsweek Media Group in 2017. Newsweek Media Group also owns the [Latin Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/latin-times/) and [Medical Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/medical-daily/). Newsweek reported that Etienne Uzac, co-owner of Newsweek Media Group, and Marion Kim, the company’s finance director, both stepped down due to a long-term financial fraud probe.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsweek publishes national and world news with minimal bias in wording, such as this
[Republicans Lay Ground for Battle in Congress over Biden Stimulus Plan](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-attack-joe-biden-stimulus-plan-1561884). News stories often use credible sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). Political news coverage tends to use more loaded language such as this [Republicans Attack Joe Biden Stimulus Plan, Laying Ground for Congressional Battle](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-attack-joe-biden-stimulus-plan-1561884).
Editorially, Newsweek features a wide variety of op-eds that range from right to left; however, in our review, more aligned with the right, such as this
[Kyrsten Sinema Tells the Democratic Party to Go to Hell | Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/kyrsten-sinema-tells-democratic-party-go-hell-opinion-1766040) and this [How Wokeness Hurts Philanthropy | Opinion](https://www.newsweek.com/how-wokeness-hurts-philanthropy-opinion-1765762). They do present liberal voices as well, such as [Trump is Going Down in Flames and He’s Taking the GOP With Him | Opinion.](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-going-down-flames-hes-taking-gop-him-opinion-1766046)
In November 2022, the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) wrote an article titled [Newsweek Embraces the Anti-Democracy Hard Right](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2022/11/04/newsweek-embraces-anti-democracy-hard-right). In this article, they report:
“Newsweek positioned political activist Josh Hammer to run their opinion pages during the runup to the 2020 presidential election, and since that time, the publication has taken a marked radical right turn by buoying extremists and promoting authoritarian leaders.”
While this update finds Newsweek moving right editorially, there is still a reasonable balance on the Op-Ed page, but clearly, more favor the right as of this review. In general, Newsweek is fact-based but has failed fact checks requiring corrections resulting in a Mostly Factual rating.
