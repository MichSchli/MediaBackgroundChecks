Analysis / Bias
In review, The Irish Times is considered a liberal (regulated market) newspaper that reports news about Ireland and the world. Local news is covered through journalists with minimal loaded words such as this
[Council approves demolition of one of Dublin’s biggest churches](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/council-approves-demolition-of-one-of-dublin-s-biggest-churches-1.4162981). This story is appropriately sourced. Irish Times political news favors social liberal causes such as this: [Saoirse McHugh selling her Green vision to rural Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/saoirse-mchugh-selling-her-green-vision-to-rural-ireland-1.4162699).
International news occasionally uses loaded words, sometimes directed at former President Donald Trump and other times at the USA Democratic party such as this
[Fragmented Democrat moderates inch towards death](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/fragmented-democrat-moderates-inch-towards-death-1.4163104). In general, The Irish Times holds a left-leaning editorial bias and is factual in reporting.
