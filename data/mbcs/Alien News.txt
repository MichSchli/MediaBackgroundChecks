Analysis / Bias
Alien News publishes extraordinary stories about aliens and pseudoscience, such as
[Two Enormous Crystal Pyramids Discovered at the Bottom of the Bermuda Triangle.](https://newsinstact.com/two-enormous-crystal-pyramids-discovered-at-the-bottom-of-the-bermuda-triangle-video-19417/) This story is sourced from a Youtube video, and most other stories do not contain hyperlinked sourcing.
Another example of an extraordinary claim is this
[The Moon was brought here million years ago by two Reptilian brothers, Wowane and Mpanku](https://newsinstact.com/the-moon-was-brought-here-million-years-ago-by-two-reptilian-brothers-wowane-and-mpanku-10098/). Obviously, there is no evidence for this made-up story. In general, almost all information on this website is either false or unproven.
