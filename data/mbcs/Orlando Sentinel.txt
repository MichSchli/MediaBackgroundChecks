Analysis / Bias
In review, the Orlando Sentinel covers local and Florida news through the use of staff journalists. There is minimal use of loaded language such as this:
[Sheriff Scott Israel begins suspension fight in Senate](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-scott-israel-suspension-hearing-20190618-x3zkwxryobhztmze3xz525jb7e-story.html). National and world news is typically derived from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Editorially, they have historically been known to be conservative-leaning; however, in recent years, they have endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidates such as John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton.
On 6/18/2019, The Sentinel published an editorial declaring they would not endorse President Donald Trump in 2020:
[Our Orlando Sentinel endorsement for president in 2020: Not Donald Trump](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/editorials/os-op-sentinel-not-endorsing-donald-trump-2020-20190618-63ya7cyb5ngf3irllodwxnznui-story.html). A thorough review of the editorial page indicates a left-leaning bias in story selection.
