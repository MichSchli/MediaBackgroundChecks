Analysis / Bias
Tasnim has strong
[links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasnim_News_Agency#cite_note-4) with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and according to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/its-become-a-monster-is-irans-revolutionary-guard-a-terror-group) the US accuses the IRGC of terror mainly because of its military support for Hezbollah and Hamas, organizations that the US and EU have both designated as terrorist groups.
Although the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) don’t openly affiliate themselves with any political parties, the
[Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran (ABADGARAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Builders_of_Islamic_Iran)) is widely viewed as a political front for the Revolutionary Guards and they are described as “Iran’s neocons”, therefore we rate the political stance of Tasnim as right-wing bias.
Reporters without Borders has
[reported](https://rsf.org/en/iran) Iran as “One of the most oppressive countries” According to the [Reporters without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) 2023 report, Iran ranks 177 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
The content of headlines and articles use loaded words pertaining to national news such as “
