History
World Tribune is an American news outlet that focuses on international news and geopolitics. According to their
[about page](https://www.worldtribune.com/about/), “World Tribune.com is an online international newspaper that publishes daily (Sunday-Friday). The focus is geopolitics and the political-cultural war of ideas. The mission is to provide leadership-minded readers everywhere with need-to-know reports missed by “mainstream” corporate media.” They further state that their content partners are the following, all of which we rate either right-biased or questionable: [DrudgeReport.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/) [The Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/) [Hoover Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hoover-institution/)

Funded by / Ownership
World Tribune claims ownership is East West Services, Inc.; however, the closest we can find is a building service in San Jose, California. We also found a
[LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/company/east-west-services-inc.?trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1) that may be closer to the truth. Revenue appears to be derived from advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, World Tribune publishes news stories with emotionally loaded words that favor the right such as this:
[Unreported: ‘Christianophobic’ attacks on the rise in France and Germany.](https://www.worldtribune.com/unreported-christianophobic-attacks-on-the-rise-in-france-and-germany/) This story provides zero links to support their report. In another story: [How Soros-funded out-of-state networks orchestrate state-level legislation](https://www.worldtribune.com/how-soros-funded-out-of-state-networks-orchestrate-state-level-legislation/), there is again zero linking or evidence to support their claims. Let’s go deeper and look at the science. When it comes to [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), this source [does not support the consensus of science at all.](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=climate+change&btnG=Search&domains=WorldTribune.com&sitesearch=WorldTribune.com)
During the Covid-19 pandemic, they frequently published
[misinformation](https://www.worldtribune.com/florida-surgeon-general-84-increase-in-cardiac-related-deaths-in-vaxxed-men-aged-18-39/). In general, the World Tribune publishes many true stories; however, occasionally, they publish outright fake news.
