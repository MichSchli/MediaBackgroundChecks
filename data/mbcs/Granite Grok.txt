Analysis / Bias
Granite Grok, a self-proclaimed “New Hampshire’s online voice of liberty and justice,” exhibits a clear and consistent right-wing bias in its reporting. This slant is evident in both the site’s self-description and the content of its articles. The site’s articles often use emotionally loaded language and suggestive questioning, often without presenting substantial evidence to support their claims.
For instance, in the article
[“Two Years Later: Oregon Legalized Hard Drugs, and It Went About as Well as You’d Expect,”](https://granitegrok.com/blog/2023/11/two-years-later-oregon-legalized-hard-drugs-and-went-about-as-well-as-youd-expect) the author employs phrases like “beaten its scrawny little ass” to describe the perceived failure of progressive policies in Oregon. Additionally, the article makes unsubstantiated claims, such as implying that NARCAN’s makers might have supported Oregon’s Measure 110, admitting no research was done to substantiate this by stating, “I didn’t look, but it feels right.”
In another article,
[“Warmest Autumn on Record? – Nope!”](https://granitegrok.com/blog/2023/11/warmest-autumn-on-record-nope) Granite Grok challenges the claim of 2023 being the warmest autumn on record, citing [“Real Climate Science,”](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/#google_vignette) a source rated by Media Bias/Fact Check as a conspiracy website” with a low factual reporting rating. The article oversimplifies complex climate science, dismissing global warming based on historical temperature comparisons. Granite Grok’s consistently critical stance towards progressive policies and skepticism towards climate change narratives is evident throughout its site.
Regarding sourcing, they often rely on factually mixed sources such as the
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/#google_vignette) and other Questionable sources like the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Finally, the site’s articles often take a conspiratorial tone, accusing the political left of having hidden agendas like unraveling society or engaging in social engineering. The website also promotes debunked conspiracy theories, such as the 2020 election being stolen from Trump:
[In Case You’ve Forgotten – The 2020 Election Was Stolen](https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/07/in-case-youve-forgotten-the-2020-election-was-stolen) and misinformation regarding the Covid-19 vaccines: [Politicians, Public Health, and the Media Share Responsibility for Pfizer’s “Crime Against Humanity”.](https://granitegrok.com/blog/2023/04/politicians-public-health-and-the-media-share-responsibility-for-pfizers-crimes-against-humanity) In general, Granite Grok holds far-right editorial biases and sometimes publishes conspiratorial information that is inaccurate.
