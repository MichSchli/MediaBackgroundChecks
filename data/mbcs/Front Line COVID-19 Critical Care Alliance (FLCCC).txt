History
The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) is a small U.S. organization of physicians and former journalists formed in
[March 2020](https://covid19criticalcare.com/about/) that has advocated for various alternative treatments for COVID-19, including the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin. Paul E. Marik and Pierre Kory lead the group.

Analysis
[In January 2021](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n747), the FLCCC presented findings of a study on the use of the anti-parasite drug Ivermectin against COVID-19 to the [National Institutes of Health](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-institutes-of-health-nih/). The NIH ruled there was “insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19” without clinical trials.
A 2021 review of Ivermectin by FLCCC members on the efficacy of Ivermectin, which was provisionally accepted by
[Frontiers in Pharmacology](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/frontiers-removes-controversial-ivermectin-paper-pre-publication-68505), was then rejected because of what the publisher called “a series of strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance.” The review article included a study from Egypt that was later retracted when concerns about its data and [plagiarism](https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/93658) were uncovered. According to the [World Health Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), the FDA, and European Medicines Agency, they advise against Ivermectin for COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Still, the FLCCC has contended that Ivermectin could reduce viral load and accelerate recovery in patients.”
Bias
The organization has also developed its own prevention and early outpatient protocol called I-Mask, which includes many unproven interventions such as Ivermectin, anti-viral mouthwash, nasal iodine spray, vitamin D, aspirin, melatonin, and a wide range of other supplements and even honey. The
[protocol document](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Alliance-I-MASKplus-Protocol-ENGLISH.pdf) states “The I-MASK+ protocol is a bridge to vaccines and a safety net for those who cannot or have not been vaccinated; or are vaccinated and have concerns regarding declining protection against emerging variants. Vaccines have shown efficacy in preventing the most severe outcomes of COVID-19 and are an important part of a multi-modal strategy that must also include early treatment.”
The website also features a
[disclaimer](https://covid19criticalcare.com/about/disclaimer/) that reads, “The Ivermectin/Mask+ Protocol has not been adopted as a medical consensus. While clinical experience and research to date are promising, these products have not been proven safe and effective by prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies acceptable to US medical associations and regulatory bodies.” In general, the FLCCC promotes alternative treatments for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 while downplaying vaccines.
