[The BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and the [Centers for Disease Control](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/). Headlines and content use moderately emotional wording such as this [All the Times White People Got Reparations for No Longer Enslaving People](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/all-the-times-white-people-got-reparations-for-no-longer-enslaving-people/).
Editorially, The Good Men Project advocates a progressive liberal perspective. For example, they frequently publish articles promoting social justice, such as
[What Being Drugged and Robbed Taught Me About Rape Culture](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/what-being-drugged-and-robbed-taught-me-about-rape-culture/). When reporting on Democrats, they often have a favorable tone such as this [The Biden-Harris Administration Is the Most Diverse Ever](https://goodmenproject.com/politics-2/the-biden-harris-administration-is-the-most-diverse-ever/). When covering Republicans, they present a harshly negative tone, such as [Giuliani Joins the Club: Welcome Home, Rudy](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/giuliani-joins-the-club-welcome-home-rudy-kpkn/). A quote from the article reads, “Giuliani’s abuses were so blatant that John Bolton was quoted as saying ‘Giuliani is a hand grenade that is going to blow up everybody.'” In general, they report the news factually and with progressive left editorial bias.
