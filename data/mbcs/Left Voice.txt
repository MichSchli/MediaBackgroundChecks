Analysis / Bias
In review, Left Voice presents news with minimal loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles, such as:
[“Who Wins and Who Loses in Trump’s Iran Strategy?”](http://www.leftvoice.org/Who-Wins-and-Who-Loses-in-Trump-s-Iran-Strategy) They utilize credible left-leaning sources such as the New Yorker, [WaPo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [The Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/), and [Time](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/).
Most stories favor socialist causes such as labor unions
[10,000 John Deere Workers Go On Strike](https://www.leftvoice.org/10000-john-deere-workers-go-on-strike/). They also support LGBTQ, the environment, and social justice issues. They generally support the far socialist left but lack transparency and do not offer differing viewpoints.
