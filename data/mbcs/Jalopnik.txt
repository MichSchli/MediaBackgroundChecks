Analysis / Bias
Jalopnik primarily covers automobiles and the industry through a daily newsletter, podcast, and news stories published on the website. News about the auto industry often contains moderately loaded emotional language such as
[This Conversation With A Dealer Will Hurt Your Brain](https://jalopnik.com/this-conversation-with-a-dealer-will-hurt-your-brain-1847429900). All stories reviewed were properly sourced from credible media outlets.
While Jalopnik does not produce political editorials, they report on politics related to the automobile industry. For example, in this story,
[ExxonMobil Lobbyists Admitted That The Company’s Carbon Tax Support Was A Lie: Report](https://jalopnik.com/exxonmobil-lobbyists-admitted-that-the-companys-carbon-1847214800), there is a left-leaning political perspective regarding the environment. In another story, they favor the Biden administration while denigrating former president Trump [The Biden Administration Is About To Get Serious On Emissions Standards: Report](https://jalopnik.com/the-biden-administration-is-about-to-get-serious-on-emi-1847373098). A quote reads, “This also all probably hinges, long-term, on who wins the 2024 presidential election, and if it’s Trump, then we will all be forced to watch the shittiest rerun in American history.” In general, Jalopnik presents news with a left-leaning bias that is well-sourced and factual.
