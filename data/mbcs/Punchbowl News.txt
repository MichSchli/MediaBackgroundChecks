Analysis
Punchbowl News covers Washington DC politics through 3 political journalists with extensive experience in the field. They offer breaking news and analysis on politicians and legislation through three daily newsletters, The AM (free), Midday, and PM Newsletters. They also provide a podcast called The Daily Punch. For this review, we subscribed to the free AM Newsletter and reviewed content over the course of one week.
Punchbowl News publishes news via their newsletter covering the day’s political news. The news is broken down into sections. The first section is called The Top, which lists the most important political news stories such as this “A new dynamic for Joe Biden: A trio of problems have sprouted up at home and abroad.” This story covers issues related to Israel-Palestine, the slowing US economy, and rising gas prices.
The following section is called “Trend Alert,” covering trends on Capitol Hill with low bias, such as “Congressional leaders give their rank and file a chance.” They also offer other headings depending on the news of the day. Another section is called “Moments,” which features a daily schedule of what is happening in DC. Finally, they have a section called the “Clip File,” which links to news stories from various sources such as the New York Times,
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/). These sources vary daily but usually consist of left-leaning mainstream sources with High factual ratings.
Bias
Editorially, they do not lean in any particular direction. They provide analysis and opinion on motives that may appear biased through wording such as this “Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer: Schumer is dancing on the head of a pin. He has the incentive to go quickly because he has a caucus with progressives, but he also has the imperative to slow down because of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the shadow Democratic leader of the Senate.” This type of opinion is common and covers both sides. In general, Punchbowl News is factual and direct with minimal bias through coverage of both sides.
