Analysis / Bias
LifeZette leans strongly to the right, with articles often favoring conservative viewpoints and promoting conservative figures and causes. The website also frequently criticizes liberal politicians and policies, often using loaded language and sensational headlines such as this
[Fake Charities Seek to Exploit One of America’s Most Vulnerable Populations (Terrible!)](https://www.lifezette.com/2018/08/fake-charities-seek-to-exploit-one-of-americas-most-vulnerable-populations-terrible/)
When it comes to factual accuracy, LifeZette has been known to publish articles that contain factual inaccuracies or distortions of the truth. In some cases, these inaccuracies have been serious enough to warrant corrections or retractions. While the website may provide useful insights and perspectives for those with conservative leanings, readers should approach its content critically and seek out other sources to ensure a well-rounded understanding of the topics covered.
For example, Lifezette has also been accused of
[peddling conspiracy theories](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-pro-trump-site-lifezette-white-house-briefing-20170124-story.html) such as Billionaire George Soros being linked to voting machines and Clinton’s body count. Further, the founder of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham, has a [very poor track record](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/laura-ingraham/) with fact-checkers.
