[about page](https://www.tampafp.com/about-us/), “A completely digital platform that focuses on issues of today, law enforcement, local news, national news, and technology, The Free Press captures a younger audience where that audience is focused.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Tampa Free Press publishes a mix of original news reporting and republishes news from the conservative-leaning
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). The majority of stories focus on the Tampa area and state politics. Straight news reporting uses minimally loaded language and is fact-based such as this [Homosassa Man Shot, Killed After Pointing Gun At Deputies While Hiding Under Mobile Home](https://www.tampafp.com/homosassa-man-shot-killed-after-pointing-gun-at-deputies-while-hiding-under-mobile-home/). News stories are properly sourced from official documents and first-hand accounts.
Editorially, opinion pieces strongly favor the right with articles such as these
[Op-Ed: Climate Extremism Is Making America Mentally Ill](https://www.tampafp.com/op-ed-climate-extremism-is-making-america-mentally-ill/) and [Op-Ed: It’s Time For America To Shake Off Inept Democrat Policies And A Newly Unveiled GOP Plan Does Just That](https://www.tampafp.com/op-ed-its-time-for-america-to-shake-off-inept-democrat-policies-and-a-newly-unveiled-gop-plan-does-just-that/).
When reporting on science-based issues, they sometimes are not factual. For example, they have promoted the unproven benefits of Ivermectin for Covid-19, such as this
[Columnist: Why Is The Biden Admin Set To Approve Big Pharma’s COVID Pills, But Ignore The Abilities Of Ivermectin?](https://www.tampafp.com/columnist-why-is-the-biden-admin-set-to-approve-big-pharmas-covid-pills-but-ignore-the-abilities-of-ivermectin/) Ivermectin is [not an effective treatment](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2789362) for Covid-19. They also downplay climate change, such as this [Climate Change Hysteria Renewed: Heat Wave And Tragic Building Collapse](https://www.tampafp.com/climate-change-hysteria-renewed-heat-wave-and-tragic-building-collapse/). Finally, the Tampa Free Press has amplified former President Trump’s false claims of election fraud in the 2020 election [Trump Says Barr “Wouldn’t Know Voter Fraud If It Was Staring Him In The Face.”](https://www.tampafp.com/trump-says-barr-wouldnt-know-voter-fraud-if-it-was-staring-him-in-the-face/)
In general, the Tampa Free Press reports fact-based straight local news, while op-eds are strongly right-biased and sometimes advance false claims and misinformation.
