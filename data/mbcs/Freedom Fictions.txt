Analysis / Bias
Freedom Fictions indicates they are satire through their tagline displayed on every page that reads “Fake News Fact-Checkers Fact-Checking Fake News.” The logo also contains a graphic showing they are satire. In general, this is a satire website that pokes fun at conservatives who believe and share the stories. Most stories on Freedom Fictions are fake fact checks that mock conservatives by coming up with the opposite conclusions of credible fact-checkers. For example,
[FACT CHECK: Was The Wheel Invented By An American As Trump Said?](https://freedomfictions.com/ugly-betty-saves-the-world/) And [Fact Check: Did SCOTUS Issue Order Removing Omar From Congress?](https://freedomfictions.com/fact-check-omar-removed/)
The website again displays on their
[about page](https://bustatroll.org/about-us/) that they are satire: “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie, and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental, and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you’re still having an issue with that satire thing.”
Although this site and all of Christopher Blair’s properties disclaim they are satire, they are still frequently fact-checked by fact-checkers.
