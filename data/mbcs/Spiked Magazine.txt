[The barbarism of identity politics](https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast-episode/the-barbarism-of-identity-politics/). There are also many articles featuring anti-feminist tones: [#MeToo has ruined the office romance](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/07/25/metoo-has-ruined-the-office-romance/). When it comes to UK politics, they are fiercely [pro-Brexit](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/05/27/the-brexit-surge/). When covering USA politics, they report favorably on former President Donald Trump: [If Trump is Hitler, then Obama was Hitler too](https://www.spiked-online.com/2019/06/26/if-trump-is-hitler-then-obama-was-hitler-too/).
Some articles are opposed to Trump, such as this:
