History
Accuracy in Academia (AIA) is a nonprofit watchdog group and think tank that
[describes itself](https://www.academia.org/about-aia/) as “wanting schools to return to their traditional mission-the quest for truth.” The AIA promotes academic freedom and is particularly critical of what it describes as a [left-wing bias](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/) in American academia. The AIA characterizes such bias as liberal or communist “indoctrination” and aims to stand up for the rights of politically conservative students and faculty. The AIA was founded in 1985 by columnist and former Federal Reserve economist [Reed Irvine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Irvine) as an outgrowth of [Accuracy in Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/accuracy-in-media-aim/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, as stated above, the primary aim of this website is to promote conservatism on college campuses. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines like this:
[Pistol Packin’ Teachers?](https://www.academia.org/pistol-packin-teachers/) Although this article has a moderately sensational headline, it is sourced from the Left-Center [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Most articles are properly sourced and factual.
Editorially, most stories favor a conservative perspective, such as this
[LGBTQ-themed books among books removed from Florida school libraries](https://www.academia.org/lgbtq-themed-books-among-books-removed-from-florida-school-libraries/). Generally, all stories favor the right and advocate for conservatism and sometimes do not align with the consensus of science.
Failed Fact Checks
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=Academia.org&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals that Accuracy in Academia has never failed a fact check. However, according to our methodology, this source directly links [Accuracy in Media,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/accuracy-in-media-aim/) which promotes anti-science positions and has a Mixed factual rating. Further, AIA frequently does not align with the [consensus of scientists](https://www.academia.org/?s=climate+change) when it comes to [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). They often refer to those who adhere to the consensus as “alarmists.”
