History
Founded in 2017, Washington Pundit is a far-right biased news and opinion blog. Like most Questionable sources there is a complete lack of transparency without disclosure of ownership, authorship or mission statement. All articles appear to be
[published by Dr E](https://thewashingtonpundit.com/author/dr-e/) or TWP Site Admin, who does not offer a real name or biography. A [domain search](http://whois.domaintools.com/thewashingtonpundit.com) reveals the website is registered privately in the United States. Further, it appears that this website was reviewed by [Newsguard](https://api.newsguardtech.com/ED7B1C2C9551C8F2DFF7F9D3B4D84519AB811ECAA1B2FA798F6240006BDF53BAA7A37DCAD3FD6B6256DD3650CD304EF43EE0A08A9B502D39?cid=45017a30-8b64-4de7-89fd-8969fbeec880) in 2018 and since that time Washington Pundit has scrubbed all of its old content.

Analysis / Bias
In 2018,
[Newsguard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsguard/) determined the Washington Pundit was not a credible source that “regularly misrepresents stories.” It appears after this review, the Washington Pundit deleted all of its content and started from scratch in January 2019. Since we can no longer review older content this review will focus solely on content available on the website.
In review, the Washington Pundit publishes far-right conservative news and opinions without revealing an author. Headlines of articles are frequently sensationalized with loaded emotional language such as this:
[Sex Addict Anthony Weiner Moves Back in With Estranged Wife Huma Abedin](https://thewashingtonpundit.com/2019/07/23/sex-addict-anthony-weiner-moves-back-in-with-estranged-wife-huma-abedin/). This story is sourced to the Questionable [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/). The Washington Pundit appears to have a fascination with Pedophilia, especially if it involves [liberals](https://thewashingtonpundit.com/2019/07/23/kirstin-gillibrands-father-worked-as-consultant-for-nxivm-sex-cult/) or [immigrants.](https://thewashingtonpundit.com/2019/07/22/illegal-immigrants-in-nc-charged-with-1200-sex-crimes-against-kids-in-past-18-months/) Many stories on the website are copy and paste snippets from other sources that then link to the source, which of course is fine. However, some of the sources they link to are on our [Questionable list](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) such as [The Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [DC Dirty Laundry](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dc-dirty-laundry/). They also sometimes link to credible sources such as [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) and the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/). In general, the Washington Pundit reports news that is favorable to the conservative right and negative toward the left. They frequently promote propaganda and deep state conspiracy theories such as this: [Emails Between Clinton Donor and DOJ Show Conspiracy Against Trump](https://thewashingtonpundit.com/2019/05/21/emails-between-clinton-donor-and-doj-show-conspiracy-against-trump/).
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=washington%20pundit&gsc.sort=) reveals the Washington Pundit failed numerous fact checks prior to 2019. However, thus far in 2019, we have found [one failed fact check](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ca-democrats-lgbtq-bill-pedophiles/).
