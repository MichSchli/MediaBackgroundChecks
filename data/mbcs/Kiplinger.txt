Analysis / Bias
In review, Kiplinger’s publishes news and information related to personal finance and business forecasting. Articles and headlines use minimally loaded emotional language such as this
[Forgiven Student Loan Debt Will Be Tax-Free](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/credit-debt/loans/student-loans/602412/forgiven-student-loan-debt-will-be-tax-free). All articles reviewed were properly sourced from credible media outlets or first-person interviews.
Editorially, when reporting on politics, they stick with only topics that are related to business and finance, such as this
[6 Biden Stimulus Benefits That Pack the Biggest Punch](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/602413/6-biden-stimulus-benefits-that-pack-the-biggest-punch). This article is low-biased in wording and factually sourced. As a comparison, when reporting on former President Trump’s stimulus, they again used mostly neutral language such as this [Second Stimulus Check Update: Trump Signs Bill Authorizing Second Round of Stimulus Checks](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/601995/second-stimulus-check-update-trump-signs-bill-authorizing-second-round-of-stimulus). The news is factual and with little editorial bias in both story selection and wording.
