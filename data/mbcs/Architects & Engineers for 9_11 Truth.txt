History
Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth (
[AE911Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architects_%26_Engineers_for_9/11_Truth)) is an American non-profit organization of architects and engineers who dispute the results of official investigations into the September 11 attacks, including the 9/11 Commission Report. Founded in 2006, the group calls for “a truly independent investigation” into the September 11 attacks as they believe government agency investigations into the collapse of the World Trade Center have not addressed what it calls “massive evidence for explosive demolition.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth claims to consist of
[3000 certified architects and engineers](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/11/16/the-truthers-and/Y3RrUaEHaOakG60crFM9bK/story.html) who claim the World Trade Center Buildings were brought down through controlled explosive demolition. They cite evidence of [Thermite](https://www.ae911truth.org/evidence/high-temperature-thermitic-reactions) found in the debris, which is used in controlled demolitions of buildings. They also cite the speed at which [Building 7 fell](https://www.ae911truth.org/evidence/free-fall-acceleration).
AE911Truth does not make claims about who orchestrated the controlled demolition, but rather just that it happened and that there needs to be a
[new independent investigation](https://action.ae911truth.org/p/salsa/web/common/public/signup?signup_page_KEY=11418&killorg=True&loggedOut=True). Unfortunately, the official [9/11 Commission Report](https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf) does not support their claims that outlined how the buildings fell. While the arguments made are compelling, they simply are not the consensus among researchers. Therefore, their position is considered a conspiracy theory until proven otherwise.
