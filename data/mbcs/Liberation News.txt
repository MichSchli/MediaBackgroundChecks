History
[Liberation News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_News_(Internationalist)) is a socialist print newspaper that appears irregularly and a website that delivers the news. Liberation News calls for a “socialist revolution in North America and the world to end the dictatorial power of the wealthy, for a redistribution of the wealth, and for a planned economy run to meet human and environmental needs.” According to their [about page](https://www.liberationnews.org/home-page-2-2/about/), “Our mission is to link the everyday struggles of oppressed and exploited people to the fight for a new world.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Liberation News clearly states on their about page their
[mission](https://www.liberationnews.org/home-page-2-2/about/), “We are united in our belief that capitalism—the system in which all wealth and power are held by a tiny group of billionaires and their state—is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today. It must be replaced by socialism, a system where poor and working people have power and society’s wealth is used in a planned and sustainable way to meet people’s needs.”
Editorially, all articles and information favor a socialist perspective, such as this
[Karl Marx’s Theory of Exploitation](https://www.liberationnews.org/karl-marxs-theory-of-exploitation/), and this [Passing the LGBTQ Equality Act is within reach — but only if we fight for it](https://www.liberationnews.org/passing-the-lgbtq-equality-act-is-within-reach-but-only-if-we-fight-for-it/). Regarding sourcing, they use a mix of [Pinknews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pink-news/), [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/), and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). They are reasonably sourced from credible media outlets. They generally report news mostly factually and with a strong socialist left bias.
