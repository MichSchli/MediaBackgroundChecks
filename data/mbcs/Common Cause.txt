Gardner, a Republican who was the former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the administration of President Lyndon Johnson and chair of the National Urban Coalition, an advocacy group for minorities and the working poor in urban areas. As initially founded, Common Cause was prominently known for its efforts to end the Vietnam War and lower the voting age from 21 to 18. Sometimes identified as liberal-leaning, Common Cause has also been identified as nonpartisan and advocates government reform.
