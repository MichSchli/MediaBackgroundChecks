Analysis / Bias
In review, The Zero Hour website does not publish text-based news but rather links to the radio and TV program. On sources that do not provide text-based content, we provide a short summary of bias findings and failed fact checks. The website provides video clips that always favor the left with titles that contain loaded emotional language such as this
[Laura Packard on Judge Barrett and the Lives on the Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qDYJgRatus). Editorially all content supports the progressive left.
