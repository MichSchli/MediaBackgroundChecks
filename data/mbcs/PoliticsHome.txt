The House Live section typically features opinion pieces. According to the section’s
[about page](https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/about-the-house.htm), The House aims to facilitate an ongoing dialogue between parliamentarians and those working in policy and public affairs. The page also notes that the content is primarily written by MPs, with an MP serving as editor and a cross-party editorial board. Opinion pieces and commentaries offer various perspectives from politicians, political experts, and organizations, with contributions from both Labour and Conservative MPs and officials from other parties.
A review of numerous op-eds reveals that PoliticsHome covers both sides and does not use excessive emotional language to sway the reader. In general, PoliticsHome is fact-based and is low biased in reporting.
