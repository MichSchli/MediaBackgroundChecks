History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/sourcepolitics.com), Source Politics is a liberal news and opinion website that does not disclose ownership or authors of articles. The [about page](https://www.sourcepolitics.com/about-us/) states “Source Politics features opinion, political, and social commentary on the news. We are not in the business of breaking news. We source information from others that have reported on it first. We also are not to be considered an unbiased news source. Progressive/liberal/moderate Democrats comprise the majority of the bloggers that write for Source Politics, and their views and opinions typically lean that way.” The website does not list an editor, which demonstrates a lack of transparency.

Funded by / Ownership
Through some digging, we found that Source Politics may be owned/managed by
[Harriet McCune](https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/321awp/harriet-mccune). We do not confirm this, just suggesting a link. The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Source Politics exclusively favors liberal causes and agenda through story selection. For example, this story:
[Trump says ‘economy is great’ – then manufacturing numbers hit their lowest in a decade](https://www.sourcepolitics.com/trump-this-morning-the-economy-is-doing-really-well-then/). This story is appropriately sourced to [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/). In another story, [Trump calls NRA’s CEO today to personally assure him he’ll stop background checks](https://www.sourcepolitics.com/trump-calls/) there is again proper sourcing to the [Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/). A common theme found on this website is the link to David Brock controlled media such as [Media Matters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-matters/) and [Shareblue](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shareblue/). David Brock is a longtime advocate for centrist Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
A factual search reveals one failed fact check.
