A
[domain search](http://whois.domaintools.com/awarenessact.com) indicates the domain was registered in 2012; however, content on the website dates back to 2016. Awareness Act is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website that does not have an about page or disclose ownership. [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Although the website does not disclose ownership a

Analysis / Bias
In review, Awareness Act primarily publishes pseudoscience related material such as Spirituality and
[Astrology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-astrology/). They also report on health and wellness that are not always medically supported. For example in this story, [7 Reasons Why You Should Never Eat Another M&M Candy Again](https://awarenessact.com/7-reasons-why-you-should-never-eat-another-mm-candy-again/), Awareness Act claims that Mars removed Red M&M’s in 1976 and reintroduced them in 1987 due to a study in 1971 that showed the Red Dye used caused cancer. First, no other study has ever come to that conclusion, and second M&M’s never used the Dye in question. They removed Red M&M’s due to [public perception](https://www.livescience.com/33017-why-were-red-mms-discontinued-for-a-decade.html).
The website also publishes sensationalized headlines that do not match the content of the story. For example, in this story
[Study Shows GM Soy Kills Baby Rats In Only Three Weeks – What Is It Doing To Our Children?](https://awarenessact.com/study-shows-gm-soy-kills-baby-rats-in-only-three-weeks-what-is-it-doing-to-our-children/), the source is a Russian study that was actually [inconclusive](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). The author of the study states “GMOs alone may not cause the effects and that it was important to note that other contaminants may have played part in the issues encountered.”
Besides routinely publishing misleading pseudoscience articles, they also produce conspiracy stories related to
[9-11](https://web.archive.org/web/20180727035026/http://awarenessact.com/video-reveals-18-different-views-of-the-second-plane-during-the-9-11-world-trade-center-attack/). When we previously reviewed this website they had numerous conspiracy stories related to the WTC being brought down by controlled demolition. Those stories have been removed.
