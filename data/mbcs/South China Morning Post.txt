Analysis
According to a Quartz
[article](https://qz.com/1027234/how-alibaba-baba-is-reinventing-the-south-china-morning-post-scmp-a-114-year-old-newspaper-in-hong-kong/) dated 2017, they state that after being acquired by Alibaba Group, SCMP’s narrative became more pro-China. The article also quotes Joseph Tsai, Alibaba’s co-founder, and vice-chairman, as saying, “We wanted to tell the biggest story of our lifetime, which is China.” According to the NY Times, the [new mission](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/world/asia/south-china-morning-post-hong-kong-alibaba.html) of SCMP is “improving China’s image overseas and combating what it sees as anti-Chinese bias in the foreign media.” Reuters points out that [Jack Ma](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-jack-ma/alibabas-jack-ma-is-a-communist-party-member-china-state-paper-reveals-idUSKCN1NW073), the head of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, is a Communist Party member.
Bias
In review, The South China Morning Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as this
[“Chinese companies moving to Vietnam keep quiet on trade war to avoid wrath of authorities and staff.”](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3010530/chinese-companies-moving-vietnam-keep-quiet-trade-war-avoid) This article does not report favorably on China, as evidenced by this quote from the article “Chinese state media may have launched a fierce propaganda campaign, placing the blame for the trade war squarely at the feet of the US government.”
They further state, “Companies are also fearful of growing hostility from local governments in China, should they announce their plans to relocate.” In another example of negative reporting on China, we examined their critical tone regarding
[China’s vaccine scandal](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2157341/fake-data-disease-afflicting-chinas-vaccine-system), with this quote “Disease numbers are being swept under the carpet and false expiry dates slapped on injections, industry insiders say.” In general, articles are poorly sourced and lack hyperlinks.
When reporting U.S. news, they use minimally loaded language in their headlines, such as “
[Donald Trump warns China to reach a trade deal now, or face a ‘far worse’ one if I get re-elected.”](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3009895/donald-trump-warns-china-reach-trade-deal-now-or-face-far) Again, when it comes to sourcing, they use quotes or sources to themselves rather than providing hyperlinks. They also write pro-China articles such as [“Chinese President Xi Jinping warns of disaster if one civilization imposes its will on another.”](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3010287/cultural-superiority-stupid-and-disastrous-chinese-president) Editorials tend to be pro-business such as [this](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/3010212/china-prepared-worst-if-its-best-fails-secure-trade-deal) “Beijing could not give in to all US demands at recent talks out of concern for national dignity and matters of principle, so G20 may be last chance for the two leaders to meet ahead of an even more ferocious trade war.” They also have a content partnership with Politico.
Although SCMP has been accused of promoting China, we find evidence that they cover both sides by being critical of China and praising them.
