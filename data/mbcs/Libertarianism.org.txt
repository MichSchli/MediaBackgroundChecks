Analysis / Bias
In review, the website is broken into the following categories:
[Explore](https://www.libertarianism.org/explore), which allows you to do filtered searches of content; [Encyclopedia](https://www.libertarianism.org/encyclopedia), which allows searching the entire website; Guides, which are online courses to learn about Libertarianism; followed by [Podcasts](https://www.libertarianism.org/podcasts) and [Books.](https://www.libertarianism.org/books) Before we begin, it may be helpful to understand the definition of Libertarianism. In its most simple terms, it is “the philosophy of personal and economic freedom.”
Libertariansm.org features opinion columns that are generally negative toward progressive economics, such as this:
[What Paul Krugman Got Wrong About Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 70% Tax Rate](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/what-paul-krugman-got-wrong-about-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-tax-rate). This opinion is properly sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the [Tax Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tax-foundation/). Libertarianism.org does not have a favorable view of [President Trump](https://www.libertarianism.org/media/free-thoughts/liberaltarianism-trump) and does not support his [immigration policies](https://www.libertarianism.org/media/free-thoughts/truth-about-immigration). They also support socially liberal policies such as [gay marriage](https://www.libertarianism.org/media/video-collection/should-governments-regulate-marriage) and [marijuana legalization](https://www.libertarianism.org/podcasts/free-thoughts/unintended-consequences-drug-prohibition). Regarding science, such as [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they support the consensus of science; however, they do not support Government solutions.
In general, Libertarianism.org is right economically and left-leaning socially. We rate economic philosophy higher than individual social issues; therefore, overall, they are right-center biased.
