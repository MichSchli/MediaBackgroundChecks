Analysis / Bias
In review, Daily Political Newswire publishes short news articles without hyperlinked sourcing. Most often, stories are linked to Twitter posts or through the use of quotes from other sources such as the
[Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/) and [Louder with Crowder,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/louder-with-crowder/) who has a [poor track record](https://factualsearch.news/#/&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=steven%20crowder&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact-check) with fact checkers. Headlines typically utilize loaded emotional language that either favors the right or denigrates the left, such as this: [Nancy Pelosi Says Illegals Will ‘Tunnel’ Under the Wall, Dan Crenshaw Humiliates Her](https://dailypoliticalnewswire.com/nancy-pelosi-says-illegals-will-tunnel-under-the-wall-dan-crenshaw-humiliates-her/). Wording within articles uses even more extremely loaded language, such as this quote about Nancy Pelosi: “We definitely appreciate Dan Crenshaw trying. If for no other reason that exposes her stupidity further.”
