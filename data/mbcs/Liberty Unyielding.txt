Further, when reporting on [vaccinations](https://libertyunyielding.com/?s=vaccinations&x=0&y=0) they typically rely on other sources that range from left to right and are [pro-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/).

A

Liberty Unyielding is listed on [Zimdars’ fake news list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Zimdars%27_fake_news_list), which does not make sense as they have not failed a fact check. This appears to be an unfair characterization that lacks evidence.
