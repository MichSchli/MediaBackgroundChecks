History
Founded in 2013, War on the Rocks is a website that reports on national security, defense, and military. According to their
[about page](https://warontherocks.com/about/), “War on the Rocks is a platform for analysis, commentary, debate, and multimedia content on foreign policy and national security issues through a realist lens. It features articles and podcasts produced by an array of writers with deep experience in these matters: top-notch scholars who study war, those who have served or worked in war zones, and more than a few who have done it all.”
According to Founder and CEO
[Ryan Evans](https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/war-on-the-rocks-is-a-national-security-site-for-a-military-tribe-that-knows-what-its-talking-about/), “Current and former military make up about 40 percent of War on the Rocks’ readership, he says; another bucket includes people in government as civilians, working on defense, diplomacy, and national security issues; there are also defense contractors, grad students, professional academics, and “people that are just very passionate about these topics,” including several journalists that cover them for the national media.” [On March 2, 2016](https://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/), War on the Rocks published an open letter signed by more than 100 members of the Republican national security community who said they were “United in their opposition to Donald Trump for President.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, War on the Rocks only publishes original commentary on war, conflict, and international politics from a realist perspective, which means that it encompasses people of many opinions with various party affiliations. Still, they all believe in the centrality of fear, honor, and interest as drivers of inter-state affairs.
Headlines sometimes use loaded emotional language, such as this
[CHANGE OR DIE](https://warontherocks.com/2020/11/change-or-die/). This is actually the title of a podcast that talks about how the military needs to adapt. Articles are properly sourced from credible outlets such as .govs, [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, War on the Rocks does not report favorably on former Donald Trump’s foreign policy, such as this
[WHAT SHOULD COME AFTER TRUMP’S FAILED CHINA POLICY?](https://warontherocks.com/2020/07/what-should-come-after-trumps-failed-china-policy/) However, they also criticized then-Vice President Biden, such as this [SPLITTING UP IRAQ: YES, BIDEN WAS WRONG](https://warontherocks.com/2014/02/splitting-up-iraq-yes-biden-was-wrong/). In general, the story selection is balanced and on topic. The commentary is straightforward and presented by experts from different political perspectives. This is a factual source with low bias.
