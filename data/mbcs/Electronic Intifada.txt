Analysis / Bias
Electronic Intifada is a news publication and educational resource focusing on Palestine, its people, politics, culture, and place in the world. However, at this time, the majority of content is related to the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The site exhibits a clear Pro-Palestinian bias in story selection and frequently employs emotionally charged language. Examples of such language include headlines like “
[Does Israel want to wipe Gaza off the map?](https://electronicintifada.net/content/does-israel-want-wipe-gaza-map/42601)” and “ [Biden’s white supremacy gives Israel carte blanche to commit genocide.](https://electronicintifada.net/content/bidens-white-supremacy-gives-israel-carte-blanche-commit-genocide/42481)” These examples demonstrate a tendency to use wording that could influence readers through appeal to emotion or stereotypes. Despite the biased presentation, articles are generally well-sourced to credible media outlets. However, we also found that they occasionally rely on poor sources like [The Grayzone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-grayzone/), [Quds News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quds-news-network-bias-and-credibility/), and [Mondoweiss](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mondoweiss/).
EI has been criticized as promoting
[extreme views](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/electronic_intifada/) and propaganda against Israel by the NGO Monitor. EI [counters](https://electronicintifada.net/content/why-ngo-monitor-attacking-electronic-intifada/9125) that the “NGO Monitor is an extreme right-wing group with close ties to the Israeli government, military, West Bank settlers, a man convicted of misleading the US Congress, and to notoriously Islamophobic individuals and organizations in the United States.”
Further, the
[ADL reports](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/fringe-left-groups-express-support-hamass-invasion-and-brutal-attacks-israel) that Electronic Intifada founder Ali Abunimah spoke on an “emergency episode” of The Red Nation Podcast on October 9, during which he blamed Israel for the violence committed by Hamas.
Editorially, Electronic Intifada holds left-leaning political views with support for the Democratic Socialists Party of the USA:
[Supporter of Palestinian rights wins huge upset in New York election](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/supporter-palestinian-rights-wins-huge-upset-new-york-election). In general, EI is reasonably factual in reporting; however, they have made false claims, sometimes relying on poor sources and focusing on one-sided reporting that may leave out important context.
