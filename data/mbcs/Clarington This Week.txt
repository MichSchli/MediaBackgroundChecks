In review, Clarington This Week uses low biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[What should Clarington’s waterfront be like in 30 years?](https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/10660794-what-should-clarington-s-waterfront-be-like-in-30-years-/) The national news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
