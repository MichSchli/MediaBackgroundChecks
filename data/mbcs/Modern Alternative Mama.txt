Analysis / Bias
In review, Modern Alternative Mama is an alternative health and wellness blog geared toward parenting and child care. Articles and headlines contain minimally loaded language, such as this
[4 Ways to Raise Culturally & Racially Sensitive Kids](https://modernalternativemama.com/2021/02/17/4-ways-to-raise-culturally-racially-sensitive-kids/). This article is reasonably sourced from credible media and information. News and information are published under the categories Health, Vaccine Guide, Real Food, Gentle Parenting, Home Schooling, and Pregnancy.
Although there is some credible information about education and discipline on this website, there is also a
[whole section](https://modernalternativemama.com/category/health/vaccines/) dedicated to [Anti-Vaccination pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). Further, during the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, they promoted misinformation regarding the [natural prevention](https://modernalternativemama.com/2020/03/12/natural-remedies-for-coronavirus/) of Covid-19 that is not supported by science. Other pseudoscientific topics include the [Dangers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) of GMOs and [Say NO to GMOs!](https://modernalternativemama.com/2011/06/07/say-no-to-gmos/), but the primary focus is on anti-vaccine propaganda.
