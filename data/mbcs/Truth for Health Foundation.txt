Funded by / Ownership
TruthforHealth.org does not run advertisements and solicits donations for funding. The website openly discloses its ownership as the nonprofit Truth for Health Foundation but lacks transparency by not listing who funds it.
Analysis / Bias
Dr. Peter McCullough is listed as part of the Medical Team.
[Dr. McCullough](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vaccine-safety-research-foundation-bias/) has been a controversial figure, particularly in relation to his stance on COVID-19 and vaccines. He has been known for promoting early alternative treatments for COVID-19 and has expressed skepticism about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. [His views have been disputed](https://www.factcheck.org/person/peter-mccullough/) by many in the medical community and have led to criticism and controversy.
The Truth For Health Foundation website publishes alternative health-related news that promotes misleading and false information, particularly regarding
[U.S. politics](https://web.archive.org/web/20230419191523/https://www.truthforhealth.org/2023/01/with-the-stroke-of-a-pen-joe-biden-betrays-americas-sovereignty/) and the COVID-19 pandemic. The site has propagated unfounded claims about the [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.truthforhealth.org/2022/04/intracellular-reverse-transcription-of-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-bnt162b2-in-vitro-in-human-liver-cell-line/), treatments, and [global health policies](https://web.archive.org/web/20230419185421/https://www.truthforhealth.org/2023/03/whos-your-daddy/). It has also promoted unproven treatments like [ivermectin for COVID-19](https://www.truthforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CovidPatientTreatmentGuide-TFH-7-31-2021.pdf). The website often blurs the lines between news and opinion, with articles containing opinionated language under the guise of news. This approach undermines the site’s credibility in presenting balanced and medically sound information.
Finally, editorially, the website consistently favors a far-right perspective that routinely denigrates the left, such as this
[Kill and confront the extremist movement](https://www.truthforhealth.org/2022/10/kill-and-confront-the-extremist-movement/). In general, the Truth for Health Foundation is far-right biased and consistently promotes disinformation and false claims regarding Covid-19 and US Politics.
