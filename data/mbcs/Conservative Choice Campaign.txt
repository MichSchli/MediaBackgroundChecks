Analysis / Bias
Conservative Choice Campaign summarizes news stories from other sources and publishes news articles by members. Summarized articles are often derived from poor sources such as
[WhatFinger](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whatfinger/), [The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), [Health Impact News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-impact-news/), and fake news website [The People’s Voice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-punch/).
Articles and headlines routinely contain emotional wording that elicits fear, such as this
[Russian Soldiers Discover “Baby Factories” in Ukraine where Young Children are Grown for Child Sex Brothels and for Organ Harvesting](https://conservativechoicecampaign.com/russian-soldiers-discover-baby-factories-in-ukraine-where-young-children-are-grown-for-child-sex-brothels-and-for-organ-harvesting/). This story originated from a Russian propaganda film and is not supported by evidence.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and exhibit extreme bias with a category titled
[Biden Bold Faced Liar.](https://conservativechoicecampaign.com/category/biden-bold-faced-liar/) Within this category, many stories are demonstratively false or misleading such as this [Wash. State Legalizes Child Kidnapping for Gender Surgeries or Abortions](https://conservativechoicecampaign.com/wash-state-legalizes-child-kidnapping-for-gender-surgeries-or-abortions/). This exaggerated claim designed to stoke fear is [false](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2023/04/fact-check-washington-state-bill-does-not-allow-government-to-take-minor-children-away-from-parents-if-they-refuse-to-agree-to-gender-transition-surgery.html): “the legislation has no provision for removing children from their parents if they don’t agree to gender affirmation surgery. The statute deals specifically with children who have run away from home.”
In general, Conservative Choice Campaign exhibits extreme right bias and lacks credibility as they do not disclose ownership and routinely publishes false or misleading news.
