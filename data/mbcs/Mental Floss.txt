Analysis / Bias
In review, Mental Floss is pretty much what you would expect from the name of the site. Light news, entertainment news, human interest, health and beauty tips, etc. In short, everything you’d expect from the Lifestyle section of your local paper. As such, it is better than average for this type of site. They do not publish hard news, nor should anyone expect them to. They do carry some light news, however, and what they do carry is factual and well-sourced. Most of their external story links are to clickbait sites which, while less than I have seen on similar sites, do detract from the overall quality. While I will admit to a personal dislike for clickbait sites, I do understand why people carry them. They do help pay the bills, after all, and that’s something we can all relate to.
