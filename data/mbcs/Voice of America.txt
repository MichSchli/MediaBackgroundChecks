History
[Founded in 1942](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America#cite_note-chuck_nbc_2013-6), Voice of America (VOA) is a United States government-funded multimedia news source and the official external broadcasting institution of the United States. VOA provides programming for broadcasts on radio, TV, and the Internet outside of the U.S., in English and some foreign languages. Some consider the Voice of America to be a form of pro-USA [propaganda](http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/20/19502580-taxpayer-money-at-work-us-funded-foreign-broadcasts-finally-available-in-the-us). However, VOA journalists are governed by its [Best Practices Guide](https://www.insidevoa.com/a/4505808.html), which says that “The accuracy, quality, and credibility of the Voice of America are its most important assets, and they rest on the audiences’ perception of VOA as an objective and reliable source of U.S., regional and world news and information.” [Surveys show](https://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2018/02/BBGBudget_FY19_CBJ_2-7-18_Final.pdf) that 84% of VOA’s audiences trust VOA to provide accurate and reliable information. A similar percentage (84%) say that VOA helps them understand current events relevant to their lives. VOA is produced in 47 languages.

Analysis / Bias
In review, VOA presents the USA and world news from a United States perspective. There is minimal use of loaded language in news stories such as this:
[Officials Hope for Strife-Free Trump Visit to London](https://www.voanews.com/a/officials-hope-for-strife-free-trump-visit-to-london/4941590.html) and this [Pompeo Seeks Common Ground on Iran, Huawei in Europe.](https://www.voanews.com/a/pompeo-seeks-common-ground-on-iran-huawei-in-europe/4941545.html) Both of these stories are sourced from official videos or credible sources. Some stories tend to lean slightly left through portraying President Trump negatively, such as this: [Trump Unleashes Again on Special Counsel Who Didn’t Charge Him](https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-mueller/4938918.html). When it comes to [science](https://www.voanews.com/p/6289.html), the VOA follows the consensus model and therefore is pro-science.
Voice of America has been called a propaganda arm of the US Government, and perhaps it was at the start. Today, it is a
