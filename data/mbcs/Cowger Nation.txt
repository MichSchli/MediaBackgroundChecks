Analysis / Bias
Cowger Nation presents news with a strong right-wing bias in reporting. All articles are favorable to the right and negative toward the left. They often use loaded wording in both headlines and the content of articles. Cowger Nation sources their information but sometimes uses poor sources such as
[Rush Limbaugh](http://cowgernation.com/2017/02/13/rush-we-are-not-far-away-from-a-civil-war/), who has a poor track record with [fact-checkers](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/).
Recent articles are usually unsourced and strongly favor the right such as this
[Healthy Nation and Freedom of Expression: In Defense of Faith, Truth, & Liberty](https://cowgernation.com/2021/04/27/healthy-nation-and-freedom-of-expression-in-defense-of-faith-truth-liberty/), and they promoted exaggerated misinformation regarding Covid-19 such as this [Joe Biden’s America: Grandma Can’t Come Over for Christmas](https://cowgernation.com/2020/12/17/joe-bidens-america-grandma-cant-come-over-for-christmas/). In general, Cowger Nation is a low credibility source based on a lack of transparency, poor soucing, and one-sided right-biased reporting.
