Analysis / Bias
The blog covers topics related to transgender issues and LGBTQ+ rights, providing detailed information and perspectives. For example, an article titled
[“Will Republicans Shutdown Government In Part Over Trans People?” ](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/will-republicans-shutdown-government)criticizes the Republican Party’s focus on transgender issues as a diversion from more pressing matters. It suggests that the party is using these issues as a “red line” or sticking point, potentially at the expense of the government’s functioning and more immediate concerns like healthcare and civil rights. The author uses emotionally loaded language throughout the article, such as “The party’s fixation on trans issues…” and “In an era marked by concerns over escalating grocery costs and healthcare affordability, an emphasis on anti-trans politics risks painting the GOP as woefully disconnected.” The article cites various credible sources, including specific bills, [Health and Human Services](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP07/20230714/116252/BILLS-118--AP--LaborHHS-FY24LHHSSubcommitteeMark.pdf), [“The 19th News”](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-19th-news/), [Rand Corporation,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rand-corporation/) [House.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-house-representatives-house-gov/), [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), and [The Advocate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/advocate/).
Another article we analyzed, titled
[“No Longer About Kids: Florida Judge Allows Trans Adult Ban For Large Swaths Of Care.” ](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/no-longer-about-kids-florida-judge) discusses the shift in legislative focus from transgender youth to adults. It cites specific court cases and legislation. Both articles are factual, informative, well-researched, and cite specific [court cases](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca11.78510/gov.uscourts.ca11.78510.125.1.pdf), credible sources, and legislation. However, as an advocacy blog focusing on transgender and LGBTQ+ issues, the site presents these facts within a specific framework that aligns with its advocacy goals, leading to one-sided reporting.
In general, Erin in the Morning (Erin Reed) holds progressive left views and sometimes promotes unproven or misleading claims (see failed fact checks).
