Analysis / Bias
In review, Göteborgs-Posten mainly focuses on covering local news such as
[“Taxi driver is charged with rape against passengers.”](https://www.gp.se/nyheter/v%C3%A4stsverige/taxichauff%C3%B6r-%C3%A5talas-f%C3%B6r-v%C3%A5ldt%C3%A4kt-mot-passagerare-1.21911273) National and regional news are sometimes covered by reporters, using sources such as [Aftonbladet](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/aftonbladet/) and [Expressen](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/expressen/). Regarding Swedish political news, the tone is critical of the current Left-Center PM Stefan Löfven: [“Arne Larsson: A big failure for the prime minister”](https://www.gp.se/nyheter/ett-stort-misslyckande-f%C3%B6r-statsministern-1.18436361) and also presents a negative tone towards immigration, [“Immigration is not needed to support an aging population.”](https://www.gp.se/debatt/invandring-beh%C3%B6vs-inte-f%C3%B6r-att-f%C3%B6rs%C3%B6rja-en-%C3%A5ldrande-befolkning-1.15623481)
When covering world news, they use wire services such as
[Sweden’s National News Agency TT](https://tt.se/en/about-us/) (owned jointly by the national newspapers and, therefore, the [media owners](http://www.aalep.eu/news-agencies-eu-member-states)). They cover the former Trump administration with a negative tone such as [“Donald Trump’s psyche in the limelight”](https://www.gp.se/nyheter/v%C3%A4rlden/donald-trumps-psyke-i-rampljuset-1.4755484) and use emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as [“More and more people are taking their lives in the United States.”](https://www.gp.se/nyheter/v%C3%A4rlden/allt-fler-tar-sina-liv-i-usa-1.15791697) Although this story may be true, there isn’t a single hyperlink to support their claims.
