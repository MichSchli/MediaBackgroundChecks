[Andy Caldwell reported questionable campaign donations — it’s ‘nothing nefarious,’ he says](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/politics-government/election/article240501161.html). National and international news is covered by other McClatchy properties as well as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, The Tribune typically does not endorse Presidential candidates; however, in 2016, they made an exception and endorsed Democratic Candidate
[Hillary Clinton](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/editorials/article110732852.html). A review of editorials demonstrates more favor left-leaning positions such as [public education funding](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/editorials/article240373211.html) and reporting negatively on conservatives, such as this [SLO County official compared Democrats to Nazis. He should apologize and resign](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/editorials/article238785748.html#storylink=mainstage). In general, they report news factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
