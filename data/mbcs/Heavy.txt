Analysis / Bias
In review, Heavy does not perform original news reporting, but rather is known for their
[fast five facts](https://heavy.com/news/2019/07/john-paul-stevens-donald-trump-5-fast-facts-you-need-to-know/), where they take a story from a credible news outlet and bullet point five facts about the story. Topics range from entertainment to breaking news and politics. Heavy uses mild to moderate loaded language in headlines such as this: [How Much Will Trump’s Fourth of July Salute to America Cost?](https://heavy.com/news/2019/07/how-much-will-trumps-fourth-of-july-salute-to-america-cost/) This story is properly sourced to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), and [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/).
According to
[Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), Heavy does not do original reporting, but the speed they can compile their [fast facts is very quick](https://slate.com/technology/2017/03/heavy-com-five-fast-facts-you-need-to-know.html). It has also been this reviewer’s observation that Heavy is often one of the first to break down a fast-breaking story. Heavy present news with balance, but more stories would appeal to the left.
