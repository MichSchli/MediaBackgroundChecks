History
New Eastern Outlook (NEO) is a journal operated by the
[Russian Academy of Sciences Institute for Oriental Studies](https://www.ivran.ru/en/new-eastern-outlook), a nonprofit research institute based in Russia. According to the New Eastern Outlook (NEO) [about page](https://journal-neo.org/about/), they cover political events as they relate to the Orient and regions “from Japan and the remote coasts of Africa.” [NEO](https://www.ivran.ru/en/new-eastern-outlook) focuses primarily on “political and religious issues, economic and ideological trends, regional security topics and social problems.” [Vitaly Naumkin](https://www.ivran.ru/en/news?artid=210504) is the president of Oriental Studies. Critics of NEO claim they are a source of disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda. [Read how the Russian Government influences Media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Ownership information is not transparent; however, according to the NEO about page, its address is “12, Rozhdestvenka Street, office 111, Moscow.” The exact address is also used by “
[The Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences.”](https://www.ivran.ru/en/new-eastern-outlook) Typically, the Putin government gives the [Research Institutes’](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/science/russia-ukraine-science-academy.html) control to the Ministry of Education; therefore, the Russian government funds and owns this journal through the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Analysis / Bias
[The U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0628) states that New Eastern Outlook is “a pseudo-academic publication of the Russian Academy of Science’s Institute of Oriental Studies.” It further says that “it combines pro-Kremlin views of Russian academics with anti-U.S. views; of Western fringe voices and conspiracy theorists.” Also, a U.S. Department of State special report indicates [New Eastern Outlook](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pillars-of-Russia%E2%80%99s-Disinformation-and-Propaganda-Ecosystem_08-04-20.pdf) is “obscuring its links to state-funded institutions.”
In review, New Eastern Outlook (NEO) presents news in line with the Russian Government’s narrative, such as
[“The Donbas Dilemma”](https://journal-neo.org/2018/11/16/the-donbass-dilemma/) and [“Can the Conflict with Turkey over NATO Enlargement be Resolved?”](https://journal-neo.org/2022/05/30/can-the-conflict-with-turkey-over-nato-enlargement-be-resolved/) They sometimes utilize credible news sources such as [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) and [National Interest](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-interest/). However, they also publish articles that promote conspiracy theories, such as [“Ukraine’s Nazi Legions a Real Threat to America and the World”](https://journal-neo.org/2022/04/06/ukraine-s-nazi-legions-a-real-threat-to-america-and-the-world/) and [“Why is the United States Getting Away with Unleashing a Global Biological War?”](https://journal-neo.org/2022/05/14/why-is-the-united-states-getting-away-with-unleashing-a-global-biological-war/) These stories are sourced from conspiracy-pseudoscience sites such as [Veterans Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/veterans-today/) and [The Daily Expose.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-expose/) Furthermore, EUvsDisinfo reports that NEO uses [ghost authors](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/the-journalists-who-exist-only-on-paper/#).
In 2019, NEO was one of
[12 Facebook Pages](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/07/removing-cib-thailand-russia-ukraine-honduras/?source=post_page---------------------------) removed “for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior.” Finally, in 2021, [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/) [reported](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/mar/09/fact-checking-vaccine-claims-alleged-disinformatio/) that The U.S. State Department says it “has identified four online publications used by Russian intelligence services to spread disinformation about Western COVID-19 vaccines.” One of these sources was NEO. In general, New Eastern Outlook is a right biased propaganda mouthpiece for the Russian government that frequently promotes disinformation.
