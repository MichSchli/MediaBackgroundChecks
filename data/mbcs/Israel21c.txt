Analysis / Bias
In review, ISRAEL21c focuses on technology-related news such as
[”Polytex expands contactless scrubs dispensing in Spain.”](https://www.israel21c.org/polytex-expands-contactless-scrubs-dispensing-in-spain/) In their headlines, they use minimally loaded language such as this: [ “Israeli Election Day is still surprisingly low-tech.”](https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-election-day-is-still-surprisingly-low-tech/) They sourced this story from government sources such as the [Israel Ministry of foreign affairs.](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/State/Democracy/Pages/FAQ-Elections-in-Israel-2019.aspx) Further, they also utilize credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/).
When covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they usually are objective as they cover both sides fairly, such as this:
[“Pain and hope fill hearts of Israeli coexistence activists”](https://www.israel21c.org/pain-and-hope-fill-hearts-of-israeli-coexistence-activists/) and [“Arab nurse reunites with Jew he saved from Acre lynching.”](https://www.israel21c.org/arab-nurse-reunites-with-jew-he-saved-from-acre-lynching/) In general, their coverage leans left in regard to culture and lifestyle, such as [“Taking ‘pride’ in Israel’s gay rights.”](https://www.israel21c.org/taking-pride-in-israels-gay-rights/)
