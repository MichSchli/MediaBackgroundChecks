History
Founded in 1997, Answers in Genesis (AiG), headed by
[Ken Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Ham), is a Christian apologetics ministry that promotes “creation science.” According to their [about page](https://answersingenesis.org/about/), “Answers in Genesis is an apologetics (i.e., Christianity-defending) ministry, dedicated to enabling Christians to defend their faith and to proclaim the [gospel of Jesus Christ](https://answersingenesis.org/about/good-news/) effectively.”
Ken Ham is also the creator of the
[Creation Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Museum) in Tennesse that promotes pseudoscientific, young-Earth creationist (YEC) explanation of the universe’s origin based on a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative in the Bible.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Answers in Genesis is a website that publishes news and information regarding young-earth creationism. The website rejects the scientific consensus on evolution such as this:
[Evolution? Impossible!](https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/evolution-impossible/). This review will be short. They reject science and interpret Genesis literally. Since we rate sources based on scientific consensus, Answers in Genesis is [pseudoscientific](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Answers_in_Genesis) by our methodology. A disclosure: several years ago, I refuted Ken Ham with scientific evidence on his Facebook page and was promptly blocked without explanation.
