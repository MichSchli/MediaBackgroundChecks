Analysis / Bias
In review, Boston.com generally publishes articles with minimal emotionally loaded language such as, “
[Bernie Sanders denies telling Elizabeth Warren that a woman couldn’t win in 2020”. ](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/01/13/bernie-sanders-denies-woman-couldnt-win) National and world news is typically republished from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and Boston Globe.
When it comes to sourcing Boston.com often hyperlinks to itself and to credible sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), and pro-science sources such as [ScienceDirect](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sciencedirect/).
Editorially, when covering the former Trump administration, Boston.com uses a critical tone, such as in this article,
[“Donald Trump sent a letter invoking the Salem witch trials. The city’s mayor responded with a history lesson.”](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/12/18/donald-trump-impeachment-salem-mayor-witch-trials) They also publish stories that focus on left-leaning concerns like this: [This is why a Brookline independent abortion clinic has turned to GoFundMe for help](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/01/13/womens-health-services-gofundme). In general, Boston.com reports news factually, with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
