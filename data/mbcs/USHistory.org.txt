Analysis / Bias
Ushistory.org is an educational website offering free e-textbooks and resources on
[US history](https://www.ushistory.org/us/index.asp), focusing on the Revolutionary and Colonial eras. The site also features interviews, including one with James W. Loewen titled [“James Loewen- Debunking History.](https://www.ushistory.org/us/historians/loewen.asp)” In the interview, he discusses his efforts to challenge myths and inaccuracies in American history education. Loewen reflects on his book “Lies My Teacher Told Me,” responding to questions posed by an unidentified interviewer called BB Host and other guests named Sara and Rich.
While their affiliation with the website remains unclear, the interviewers ask low-biased questions. For instance, Rich asked Loewen about alternatives to history textbooks, and Loewen suggested shorter textbooks and incorporating different voices, including original sources. Loewen commended the internet’s ability to provide diverse perspectives; although not all websites can be trusted, he believed this could teach critical thinking. In his own words, “the Web speaks in many voices. Some sites cannot be believed. That’s fine. That, too, teaches. Such sites teach critical thinking, which is part of what doing history is all about.”
Generally, reviewing the website’s content reveals fact-based information that is properly sourced.
