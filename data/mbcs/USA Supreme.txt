Analysis / Bias
In review, USA Supreme covers politics with a strong right-leaning conservative bias and culture, entertainment, health, fitness, and fashion. Articles and headlines often contain strong emotional wording that often denigrates Muslims, such as this
[Somali Muslims Take Over Small Tennessee Town Forcing Absolute Terror On Terrified Christians There](https://www.usasupreme.com/somali-muslims-take-small-tennessee-town-forcing-absolute-terror-terrified-christians/). This story, like most on the website, is mostly the opinion of the author and completely unsourced.
In another story, they once again fail to properly source their information and promote an unproven conspiracy theory
[Former Star Philadelphia Prosecutor Beverly Campbell Was Assassinated Because She Was About To Reveal The Wholesale Corruption Of The Electronic Voting Process](https://www.usasupreme.com/former-star-philadelphia-prosecutor-beverly-campbell-was-assassinated-because-she-was-about-to-reveal-the-wholesale-corruption-of-the-electronic-voting-process/). In general, story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left while frequently promoting conspiracy theories directed at Muslims.
