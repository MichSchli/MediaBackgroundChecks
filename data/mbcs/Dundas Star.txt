In review, Dundas Star uses low biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Dundas Delsey Pond dredging to be resumed by city](https://www.thespec.com/local-dundas/news/2022/07/11/dundas-delsey-pond-dredging-to-be-resumed-by-city.html). The national news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
