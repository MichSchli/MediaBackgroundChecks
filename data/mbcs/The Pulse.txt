History
Founded by Joe Martino in 2021, The Pulse is a clickbait, conspiracy, and quackery-level pseudoscience website. According to their
[about page](https://thepulse.one/about/), “The Pulse provides investigative journalism & analysis on current events, science, consciousness, solutions & more – with an inquiry into how current paradigms shape our society.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not clearly identify that Joe Martino is the owner.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Pulse promotes numerous conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. For example, they promote 9/11 conspiracies such as
[9/11: The Latest Science Collapses The Mainstream Narrative](https://thepulse.one/2021/09/11/9-11-the-latest-science-collapses-the-mainstream-narrative/). Other topics you will find are [alien visitations](https://thepulse.one/2021/06/25/pentagon-ufo-report-explanations-fall-into-one-of-five-categories/), [chemtrails](https://thepulse.one/2022/07/12/what-weakened-immune-systems-have-wrought-for-children/), [anti-GMO propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), and [anti-Vaxx articles](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this: [Does The CDC Have Evidence To Support Their Statement “Vaccines Don’t Cause Autism?”](https://thepulse.one/2020/03/08/does-the-cdc-have-evidence-to-support-their-statement-vaccines-dont-cause-autism/)
Regarding vaccines, The Pulse frequently promotes disinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccines, such as
[The COVID Vaccine Narrative Has Sunk, And The Powers That Be Have Stopped Trying To Hide It](https://thepulse.one/2022/05/02/the-covid-vaccine-narrative-has-sunk-and-the-powers-that-be-have-stopped-trying-to-hide-it/) and [Researchers Examine Autopsies of Two Boys Who Died Days After COVID Vaccine](https://thepulse.one/2022/03/07/researchers-examine-autopsies-of-two-boys-who-died-days-after-covid-vaccine/). There are [no confirmed deaths](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/21/steve-kirsch/contorted-claim-children-killed-covid-19-vaccines-/) involving children linked to the vaccines. [disclaims](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html)that “anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS” and that content is not vetted before being made public; therefore, there is likely a significant amount of misinformation published. We also highly recommend this article [Understanding causality in adverse events after vaccination](https://healthfeedback.org/understanding-causality-in-adverse-events-after-vaccination/)as a way to understand why VAERS does not prove causality and why the numbers should not be taken literally.
