History
Blue Lives Matter is a pro-police movement in the United States. It was started after the killings of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York, on
[December 20, 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter), after they were ambushed in their patrol car. Blue Lives Matter was formed in reaction to the [Black Lives Matter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/black-lives-matter/) movement, which seeks to end police brutality against the African American community. According to their [about page](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/about-the-police-tribune/), “Blue Lives Matter is a media company, founded and run entirely by active, former, and retired law enforcement officers and their families.”
The website was renamed The Police Tribune in 2020.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Police Tribune reports on news related to crimes committed against police and perceived injustices against police, such as this
[Seattle Rioting Leaves 12 Officers Injured, Numerous Businesses Vandalized](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/seattle-rioting-leaves-12-officers-injured-numerous-businesses-vandalized/). This story is properly sourced to [KIRO7](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kiro-7/), the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Seattle Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/seattle-times/). Another sample story is as follows [Man Arrested For Throwing Molotov Cocktail At Police Horses](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/man-arrested-for-throwing-molotov-cocktail-at-police-horses/). This story is also properly sourced to local media WTEN. Although most stories are properly sourced to credible media outlets, some are [linked to poor sources](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/project-veritas-posts-more-videos-of-bernie-staffers-promoting-killing-opponents/), such as [Project Veritas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-veritas/), which has failed fact checks and has been caught editing videos misleadingly. We have also found [examples](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/felons-illegals-ms13-get-big-california-welcome-at-states-borders/) of using Questionable sources such as [Political Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/political-insider/) and the discredited [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Editorially, Blue Lives Matter/Police Tribune strongly supports former President Trump
[Trump Says No Suspects Are Arrested In 68% Of Baltimore Murders, Police Confirm It’s True](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/trump-says-no-suspects-are-arrested-in-68-of-baltimore-murders-police-confirm-its-true/), and this uses strong emotional language [School District Defends AP History Lesson Calling Trump A Nazi And Communist](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/school-district-defends-ap-history-lesson-calling-trump-a-nazi-and-communist/). The website also frequently reports negatively on Black Lives Matter highlighting crimes and implying they are racist [Muhammad Ali’s Son Says Dad Wouldn’t Have Supported ‘Racist’ Black Lives Matter](https://bluelivesmatter.blue/muhammad-alis-son-says-dad-wouldnt-have-supported-racist-black-lives-matter/). Blue Lives Matter/Police Tribune presents a strong conservative bias that utilizes poor sources and publishes news that is not always verified as factual.
