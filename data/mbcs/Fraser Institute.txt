Funded by / Ownership
The Fraser Institute depends on contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations. It does not accept government grants or payments for research; however,
[individual donors](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/donate) may claim tax credits for donations, and corporate donors may claim tax deductions. The Institute has received donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars from foundations controlled by [Charles and David Koch](http://vancouversun.com/news/politics/daphne-bramham-lessons-for-canada-from-how-the-koch-brothers-hijacked-democracy), with total donations estimated to be approximately $765,000 from 2006 to 2016. It also received US$120,000 from [ExxonMobil](https://web.archive.org/web/20121025223822/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=4399cb65-c847-4d63-ac8c-21c045ec90ed&k=50786) in 2003 to 2004 fiscal period.
Analysis / Bias
According to their
[about page](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/about) Fraser Institute’s “research is [peer-reviewed](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/about/peer-review) and overseen by an Editorial Advisory Board of leading international scholars. The Fraser Institute promotes transparency in research – in other words, our methodology is open and clearly explained, and others can replicate our conclusions. In addition, the source of our data is always provided.”
In review, the website features research, education programs, an economic freedom map, school rankings, and a blog. The primary focus is on a limited government and Libertarian policy. News reporting utilizes minimal loaded words such as this:
[Assessing Canada’s Energy Sector Competitiveness: Collected Essays](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/assessing-canadas-energy-sector-competitiveness). This summary comes from a [54 page report](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/assessing-canadas-energy-sector-competitiveness.pdf) that is well-sourced.
The blog features opinions such as this:
[Our eighth-best carbon policies](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/our-eighth-best-carbon-policies). This article is properly sourced to the [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/). When it comes to science, the Fraser Institute does not support the consensus of science through the publication of false or misleading stories. For example, in this article ( [Climate Policy Implications of the Hiatus in Global Warming](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/research/climate-policy-implications-hiatus-global-warming)), they make the false claim that [global warming](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) has not increased significantly since 1998. This year is frequently cherry-picked due to it being the warmest year on record at that time, and has been [debunked for years](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/debunking-the-persistent-myth-that-global-warming-stopped-in-1998-20130927-2ui8j.html). [Other articles](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/federal-climate-report-uses-natural-weather-events-to-spark-scary-headlines) on the website also minimize the impact of climate change. In general, they are usually reliable for credible libertarian-leaning news; however, they do not always report factually when it comes to scientific issues.
