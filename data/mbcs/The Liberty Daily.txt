History
[Founded in 2010](http://whois.domaintools.com/thelibertydaily.com), The Liberty Daily is a news and opinion website with a tagline that reads “The Conservative Alternative to the Drudge Report.” This seems to imply they are more right-wing biased than the [Drudge Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/). The website does not provide an about page nor specify an owner, thereby lacking transparency.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Liberty Daily does not produce original content. Like the Drudge Report, they link to curated/aggregated news stories from other sources. The story selection always favors the right and most times denigrates the left. In order to review the bias and credibility of The Liberty Daily, we followed the links to see what sources they led to. We randomly chose 50 news stories and calculated the sources used. Out of 50 stories, all sources used were either rated
[Right Biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right/), [Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/), or [Conspiracy-Pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/). More than 50% of the sources used were either Questionable or Conspiracy sites. Some notable sources used are [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) (Questionable), [DcDirtyLaundry](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dc-dirty-laundry/) (Questionable), [Neon Nettle](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/neon-nettle/) (Conspiracy), [Big League Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-league-politics/) (Questionable), and [Red State](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/) (Questionable).
Further, 100% of the sources had a factual rating of Mixed or less. In general, The Liberty Daily curates strongly right-leaning news from sources that are not always factual.
