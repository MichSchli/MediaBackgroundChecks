History

It is published by the conservative think tank, [The Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/). The Daily Signal is based in Washington, DC. The current editor is [Robert Bluey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bluey), who wrote for many other right-leaning publications such as [The Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), [RedState](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/), [Big Government](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-government-news/), and the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/).

Funded by / Ownership
The Heritage Foundation owns the Daily Signal. The website does not have advertising and is completely funded through The Heritage Foundation, which has
[drawn criticism](https://www.americaninno.com/dc/tea-party-heritage-foundation-launches-news-site-the-daily-signal/) for right-leaning bias due to all funding coming from the right-leaning think tank.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Signal reports on political news and policy with a right-leaning bias in both story selection and wording such as this:
[Osama Bin Laden Was Right.](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/27/osama-bin-laden-was-right/) This article is critical of President Trump’s decision to leave Syria, arguing that pulling out will result in “at some point having to fight them again on U.S. soil.” In other words, the Daily Signal supports a more right-leaning interventionist Neoconservative military approach.
In another article, the moderate use of loaded language in the headline negatively portrays the Mueller investigation:
[Mueller Investigation Stirring Up More Trouble Than Its Finding.](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/27/mueller-investigation-stirring-up-more-trouble-than-its-finding/) This particular story is republished directly from the [Tribune Content Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tribune-news-service/). Other stories are [republished](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/26/mark-meadows-says-trump-will-not-budge-on-requested-amount-for-wall-funding/) from the factually Mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). Original news stories such as [this one](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/26/3-times-special-prosecutors-were-fired/) are typically properly sourced through hyperlinking to credible media sources.
Editorially, The Daily Signal
[consistently casts doubt](https://www.dailysignal.com/?s=climate+change) on the role of humans in [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) with articles such as this: [Climate Change Alarmism Is the World’s Leading Cause of Hot Gas.](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/12/08/climate-change-alarmism-is-the-worlds-leading-cause-of-hot-gas/) Further, all opinion pieces favor the right and denigrate the left. In general, story selection and editorials almost always favor the right, though, at times, The Daily Signal is critical of former President Donald Trump’s policies and actions.
