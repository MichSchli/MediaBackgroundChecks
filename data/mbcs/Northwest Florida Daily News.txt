Editorially, we cannot find a record of Presidential endorsements. However, a thorough review of op-eds reveals moderate balance with more pieces favoring the left, such as this:
[ANOTHER VIEW: Put public health ahead of demands from protesters](https://www.nwfdailynews.com/opinion/20200423/another-view-put-public-health-ahead-of-demands-from-protesters). Although some left-leaning bias is reflected in op-eds, there are opposing opinions as well. Therefore we rate them Least Biased.
