History
Founded in 2012 by
[Justin Brotman](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattles-own-click-bait-news-site-serves-up-red-meat-for-liberals/), the Bipartisan Report is a news and opinion website with a very clear liberal bias. The website does not provide a formal about page and states, “We Bring the News.” Justin Brotman is the son of co-founder and chairman of [Costco Wholesale Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco), Jeffrey Brotman. Bipartisan Report completely lacks transparency through a missing about page and non-disclosure of ownership; however, they provide [emails](https://bipartisanreport.com/contact-us/) for their writers.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Bipartisan Report is not bipartisan in any way, shape, or form. Story selection always favors the left and often uses powerful, emotionally loaded language such as this:
[Acosta Trolls Trump On National Television As WH Panic Sets In](https://bipartisanreport.com/2019/09/30/acosta-trolls-trump-on-national-television-as-wh-panic-sets-in/) and [Trump Sweats Certain Impeachment Doom On Twitter](https://bipartisanreport.com/2019/09/30/trump-sweats-certain-impeachment-doom-on-twitter/). This last story is sourced from tweets. Editorially, Bipartisan Report is 100% left, with consistent denigration of the right: [AOC Thrashes McConnell After His Supporters Grope & Choke Cardboard Cutout](https://bipartisanreport.com/2019/08/06/aoc-thrashes-mcconnell-after-his-supporters-grope-choke-cardboard-cutout/). In general, this is a clickbait website that sells sensationalism and misleads through emotional wording.
