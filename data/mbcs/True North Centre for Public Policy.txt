Analysis
Tnc.news is the official website for True North and the focus of this review. The True North website divides news into Breaking, Immigration, Culture, Free Speech, and Economy. They also publish videos and podcasts. Most articles are originally written and produced by True North, covering local and national Canadian news and conservative commentary.
News articles feature moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Parliament cancels debate over Emergencies Act](https://tnc.news/2022/02/18/parliament-cancels-debate-over-emergencies-act/). However, opinion commentary uses highly emotional wording such as this [LEVY: The persecution of Freedom Convoy donors is disgusting](https://tnc.news/2022/02/18/levy-the-persecution-of-freedom-convoy-donors-is-disgusting/). Further, they do not label opinion content correctly causing confusion as op-eds are buried in the newsfeed. News stories are generally sourced from credible media outlets like the [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/), [CBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/), and the [Canadian Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/)
Bias
Editorially, they strongly favor a nationalist conservative perspective featuring negative reporting on left-leaning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
[FUREY: Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act to solve a crisis he created](https://tnc.news/2022/02/17/furey-trudeau-invoked-the-emergencies-act-to-solve-a-crisis-he-created/), and this [Trudeau catastrophically underestimated the truckers](https://tnc.news/2022/02/10/trudeau-catastrophically-underestimated-the-truckers-ft-rupa-subramanya/). Furthermore, they have promoted misinformation regarding Covid-19, such as in this article where they rely on VAERS data [Alberta hospital threatens to deny woman lung transplant unless she gets COVID vaccine](https://tnc.news/2021/09/03/alberta-hospital-threatens-to-deny-woman-lung-transplant-unless-she-gets-covid-vaccine/).
A quote from the article reads, “There have been close to 7,000 reported deaths between December 2020 and June 2021, according to the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).” True North fails to mention that VAERS Data is not reliable.
[Established in 1990](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The primary purpose is to detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events.
The VAERS website
[disclaims](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html) that “anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS” and that content is not vetted before being made public; therefore, there is likely a significant amount of misinformation published. We also highly recommend this article [Understanding causality in adverse events after vaccination](https://healthfeedback.org/understanding-causality-in-adverse-events-after-vaccination/) as a way to understand why VAERS does not prove causality and why the numbers should not be taken literally.
In general, True North promotes a strong right-leaning bias editorially and occasionally publishes misinformation regarding Covid-19.
