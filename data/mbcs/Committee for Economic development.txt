Its membership consists primarily of senior corporate executives from various U.S. industries and sectors. Together with its members, CED aims to sustain and promote free enterprise, improve education and healthcare, reform campaign finance, enhance corporate governance, and improve the fiscal health of the United States.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the CED “
[conducts policy research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Economic_Development) on fiscal health, education (including early childhood, K-12, and postsecondary), health care, campaign finance, women in corporate leadership, regulatory policy, immigration, infrastructure, and tax reform. CED aims to encourage American business leaders to take a more expansive view of their responsibilities by practicing what it calls “business statesmanship” — recognizing that business leaders can promote societal health by engaging in and speaking out for the common good on timely public policy issues.”
In general, this website promotes education through our current capitalist system. For example, in the story

Regarding immigration, this source uses factual data that indicates we need more immigrants to sustain our economy [,](https://www.ced.org/policyissues/immigration) which is at odds with the current conservative platform.
