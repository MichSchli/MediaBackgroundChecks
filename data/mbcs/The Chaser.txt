History
According to The Chaser about page, they are a Satire website: “The Chaser is a satirical media empire which rivals Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation in all fields except power, influence, popularity, and profitability. Founded in 1999 as an independent, satirical newspaper produced out of a spare bedroom by editors Charles Firth, Craig Reucassel, Julian Morrow, Dominic Knight (and later joined by far more talented Andrew Hansen, Chas Licciardello, and Chris Taylor), the Chaser team has since gone on to produce Classic™ comedy in just about every corner of Australian media, including print, online, radio, television and Christmas crackers.”

Analysis / Bias
The primary standard for Satire sources is that they disclaim their intentions. The Chaser disclaims they are satire on their about page. A review of material demonstrates that they favor the left with most parody poking fun at conservatives as this “Alan Jones shifts to new platform of yelling opinions at strangers in the supermarket.” They also take shots at USA policy such as this” ‘Of course we trust the Taliban, we created them’ explains Pentagon.” In general, they are a credible satire site that fully disclaims their intentions.
