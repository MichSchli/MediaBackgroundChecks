Analysis / Bias
ABC News is what some call a
[mainstream media source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media). They typically publish/report factual news that uses moderately loaded words in headlines such as this: [At Montana rally, President Trump praises Greg Gianforte for body-slamming reporter.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/montana-rally-president-trump-praises-greg-gianforte-body/story?id=58596529&cid=clicksource_4380645_1_hero_headlines_headlines_hed) Story selection tends to favor the left through both wording and bias by omission, where they underreport some news stories that are favorable to the right. ABC always sources its information from credible sources that are either low biased or high for factual reporting.
A
[Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/abc-news/) found that 37% of ABC Newsâ€™ audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 41% Mixed, and 21% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers ABC. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 48% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 32% do not, ranking them #2 in trust among the major USA news providers.
