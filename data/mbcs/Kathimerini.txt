Analysis / Bias
Kathimerini newspaper has a center-right political stance, especially in its opinion and editorial sections, where it covers economic and political issues from a liberal, pro-business perspective. This alignment with center-right ideologies, akin to the European definition of “liberal,” emphasizes support for free-market principles, individual freedoms, and limited government intervention. This stance is particularly evident in its coverage of political and economic matters.
For example, in an article titled
[“What the government is doing about expensive rents – Prime Minister’s new TikTok,”](https://www.kathimerini.gr/politics/562878631/ti-kanei-i-kyvernisi-gia-ta-akriva-enoikia-neo-tiktok-toy-prothypoyrgoy/) the language employed portrays the government’s actions positively, highlighting their initiatives while minimizing potential criticisms. Although the article acknowledges the rent increase surpassing the minimum wage hike, it overlooks critical perspectives on the government’s approach. Regarding factual accuracy, Kathimerini cites the official news agency of the Greek government, [APE-MPE](https://www.amna.gr/basic/104/%CE%A4%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B1_%CE%91%CE%A0%CE%95); while it is a reliable source for government announcements, it might not provide critical perspectives.
Furthermore, Kathimerini’s decision to republish an article titled
[“Migratory animals send ‘SOS’ – More and more species are becoming extinct, according to the UN”](https://www.kathimerini.gr/life/environment/562878946/ta-apodimitika-zoa-ekpempoyn-sos-ypo-exafanisi-olo-kai-perissotera-eidi-symfona-me-ton-oie/) from [The Guardian ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/)demonstrates its dedication to environmental issues and its support for raising awareness about the threats faced by migratory species. Kathimerini also features special reports, such as the investigative piece discussing [juvenile violence](https://www.kathimerini.gr/investigations/special-reports/562846594/dyo-mathites-peftoyn-thymata-epithesis-kathe-imera/), which incorporates expert insights and firsthand accounts predominantly through direct quotes.
In general, Kathimerini holds a slight right-leaning editorial bias and is reasonably fact-based; however, they occasionally utilize poor sourcing practices that make it difficult to verify information.
