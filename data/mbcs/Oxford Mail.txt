The Oxford Mail covers local news for the Oxford area through reporters with minimal bias, such as this
[Banbury ‘murder’ suspect released on police bail](https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/23066257.banbury-murder-suspect-released-police-bail/). Regarding sourcing, they rely on first-person accounts and large quotes, which is appropriate for a print publication.

[PA Media](https://pamediagroup.com/) (national news agency for the UK and Ireland) and [The Sunday Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/).
