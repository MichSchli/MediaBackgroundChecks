History
PLOS (for Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit
[open-access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) science, technology, and medicine publisher, innovator, and advocacy organization with a library of [open access journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_journal) and other scientific literature under an [open content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content) license. It launched its first journal, PLOS Biology, in October 2003 and publishes seven journals.
PLOS publishes the peer-reviewed research journals PLOS Biology, PLOS Climate, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Global Public Health, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, PLOS ONE, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Sustainability and Transformation, and PLOS Water.

Funded by / Ownership
The Public Library of Science, a nonprofit, owns and publishes PLOS.org. Donations generate revenue. As with all open-access publishers, they do not charge fees for the journals but instead charge the authors a fee to publish their work, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. We explain this in more detail below.
Analysis / Bias
In review, PLOS is an open-access library of science journal articles. Open Access Journals typically charge the author a fee to publish their work after a peer review. However, there has been much controversy surrounding this publishing method as many journals do not peer review. This is called a
[Predatory Journal or Publisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing). In other words, though it may look like a rigorous peer-reviewed scientific study, it is NOT. I mention this because when you Google “open access journals,” you will see many links for Predatory Journals. PLOS is NOT a Predatory publisher and is credible. All of their articles are peer-reviewed, much like [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/).
