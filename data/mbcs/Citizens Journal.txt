History
Founded in 2013, The Citizens Journal is a news and opinion website serving Ventura County, California. According to their
[about page](https://www.citizensjournal.us/about/), they are “dedicated to reporting news vital to the community, including local governments, school boards, business, civics, politics and other issues important to Ventura County. We also put state, national and international events into perspective in how they affect us here.” They further state, “News is as objective as we can make it. Editorials are something else.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Citizens Journal covers local, state, and national news through citizen journalists who publish to the website. They also feature editorials and letters to the editor. Although they do not state their conservative bias, most news stories favor the right such as this
[Beverly Hills Firefighter Sent Home On Leave Without Pay For His Religious Beliefs](https://www.citizensjournal.us/beverly-hills-firefighter-sent-home-on-leave-without-pay-for-his-religious-beliefs/). The story is appropriately sourced to credible media and primary sources. Again, when reporting national news, there is a strong right-leaning bias such as this [Merrick Garland Cites Unexplained Threats Of Violence To Involve Authorities In Culture War Issues](https://www.citizensjournal.us/merrick-garland-cites-unexplained-threats-of-violence-to-involve-authorities-in-culture-war-issues/).
Editorially, they break op-eds into the categories Conservative, Libertarian, and Progressive/Liberal. This categorization is misleading because most op-eds are highly critical under the Progressive/Liberal category, such as this
[Kamala Harris Takes ‘Party Of Science’ Off Rails With One Mind-Boggling Tweet](https://www.citizensjournal.us/kamala-harris-takes-party-of-science-off-rails-with-one-mind-boggling-tweet/). This op-ed comes from the far-right questionable [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/).
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Citizens Journal has published misleading and false information such as this
[Over Half A Million Adverse Events Reported After COVID Vaccinations In The US So Far (And Counting)](https://www.citizensjournal.us/over-half-a-million-adverse-events-reported-after-covid-vaccinations-in-the-us-so-far-and-counting/). This story originates from the highly discredited [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), which routinely promotes pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and fails fact check. In general, The Citizens Journal holds a far-right editorial bias and publishes misinformation.
