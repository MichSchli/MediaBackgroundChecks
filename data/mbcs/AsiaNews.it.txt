History
[Asianews.it](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/About-us-127.html) is a missionary news agency of the Roman Catholic Church and the official news agency of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions [(PIME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Institute_for_Foreign_Missions), which is based in Roma, Italy. Asianews.it specializes in Asian affairs. The editor-in-chief of AsiaNews is missionary and journalist Father [Bernardo Cervellera](https://www.mercatornet.com/articles/multiple_author/Bernardo%20Cervellera).
AsiaNews.it offers a Chinese edition and, as of 2003, an English edition. On the English edition’s
[about page](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/About-us-127.html), they state the website’s purpose is to “spread their faith” to the Chinese people due to the Chinese government “promoting atheism in schools and the mass media.” [Read our media profile on Italy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/italy-media-profile/).
Funded by / Ownership
AsiaNews.it is published by the
[Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Institute_for_Foreign_Missions), which is a “society of secular priests and laypeople who dedicate their lives to missionary activities.” Funding for AsiaNews.it comes through donations to PIME. The website lacks transparency as it does not indicate funding or top donors.
Analysis / Bias
The primary purpose of this website is to promote Christianity (Catholicism) in China through biased news stories that favor the Catholic Church.
[The ruling Communist Party of China](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1068681/download) practices state atheism with religious beliefs protected by their constitution. China allows state-registered religious organizations such as Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism to operate. These groups are [allowed to](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/religion-china) “possess property, publish literature, train and approve clergy”; however, their activities are tightly [regulated](https://books.google.com/books?id=vt-vDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=donations+that+exceed+100,000+yuan+(around+$15,900).&source=bl&ots=CpVfFMA0hX&sig=ACfU3U1rU-PvbIS5E8Id2MpSeuDY23lrfw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjai-Xe4-zmAhVDTt8KHTMCAewQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=donations%20that%20exceed%20100%2C000%20yuan%20(around%20%2415%2C900).&f=false) by the government.
For example, religious schooling is regulated, as is the reporting of donations in excess of 100,000 yuan (approx.$15,900), and there is a requirement to report religious events. President Xi Jinping states the Chinese government’s standpoint as “active efforts must be made to incorporate religions into the country’s socialist society.” However, the government’s tight control of religious organizations is widely criticized by western publications as a
[“crackdown on religion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2019/04/20/is-china-conducting-a-crackdown-on-religion/#42459aee19d3).” Recently, China’s State Council published new regulations on religious affairs effective as of February 1, 2020; please see the unofficial translation of the law [here](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/measures-for-the-administration-of-religious-groups/). AsianNews have criticized this new law with the article [“New administrative measures for religious groups: total submission to the Chinese Communist Party.”](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/-New-administrative-measures-for-religious-groups:-total-submission-to-the-Chinese-Communist-Party-%E2%80%8B-48919.html)
In review, Asianews.it publishes articles with strong, emotionally loaded headlines critical of former USA President Donald Trump, such as this article by Louis Raphael Sako (Archbishop of Baghdad):
[“Do not turn Iraq into a battlefield.”](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/-Solemani-killing,-Card-Sako:-Do-%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bnot-turn-Iraq-into-a-battlefield-48951.html) In another article, they are critical of the treatment of religious groups by the Chinese government, such as [“Kazakh Chinese who fled Xinjiang camp doesn’t want to go back to be tortured](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Kazakh-Chinese-who-fled-Xinjiang-camp-doesnt-want-to-go-back-to-be-tortured-48944.html).” Further, they frequently promote pseudoscience in the form of unproven miracles such as this: [My daughter, born by a miracle, will be a nun](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/My-daughter,-born-by-a-miracle,-will-be-a-nun-48560.html).
AsiaNews utilizes its own agency for sourcing, and most links in news articles lead to other pages within its website. They also source through quotes such as in this
[article](http://asianews.it/news-en/African-Evangelical-Christians-converting-China-46278.html); they mention the source as “according to Christopher Rhodes, a lecturer at Boston University’s College of General Studies, in an article dated 13 February published in Unherd.” They then provide quotes; however, they don’t use hyperlinks where the reader can validate the source’s credibility. The [original article](https://unherd.com/2019/12/how-africa-is-converting-china-2/) from Unheard is properly sourced; therefore, there isn’t a reason not to hyperlink to the original source of information.
Editorially, AsiaNews promotes the right-leaning conservative positions of the Catholic Church, such as anti-Abortion:
[Pope Francis: Abortion is never the answer](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Pope-Francis:Abortion-is-never-the-answer-47109.html). In general, the story selection and editorial opinions expressed align with the Right and promote Catholic propaganda to influence non-Christian people.
Failed Fact Checks
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=asiannews.it&gsc.sort=) reveals they have not been fact-checked; however, they have published false information. For example, they have reported a link between abortion and breast cancer: [Iranian study reveals abortion increases the risk of breast cancer](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Iranian-study-reveals-abortion-increases-the-risk-of-breast-cancer--19746.html). According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), the consensus of studies indicates that “induced abortion is not linked to an increase in breast cancer risk.” Further, another study [Induced abortion and breast cancer an updated meta-analysis](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/subjects/Breast%20Cancer/Fulltext/2018/01190/Induced_abortion_and_breast_cancer__An_updated.23.aspx) from the peer-reviewed journal Medicine did not show a direct correlation between abortions and breast cancer.
