Analysis / Bias
In review, The Big Think publishes interviews, videos, and news that utilizes minimally loaded words such as this,
[U.S. birthrate hits 32-year low. Here’s why that’s not (yet) a problem.](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/us-birthrate) This story is appropriately sourced to credible outlets. In fact, all stories are credibly sourced and science-based. Editorially, there is minimal bias, as evidenced by [these mixed articles](https://bigthink.com/search/?q=trump) related to Donald Trump.
When reviewing this site, I was torn between placing this source in Pro-Science or Least Biased, but I felt Least Biased is more appropriate because they do some fact checks and touch on some political issues. Everything here is sourced and delivered by experts in the given fields.
