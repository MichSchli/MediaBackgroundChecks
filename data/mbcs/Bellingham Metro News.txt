Analysis / Bias
Bellingham Metro News focuses on local news and events in Bellingham and the surrounding area.
The website categorizes its news into different sections, including News, Politics, Sports, Entertainment, and Business. Bellingham Metro News covers a range of local news stories, including crime news. One example is an article titled
[“Three Charged in the Murder of 5-Year-Old Girl in Ferndale.”](https://bellinghammetronews.com/local/three-charged-in-the-murder-of-5-year-old-girl-in-ferndale/)
The site sometimes sources stories directly from authorities such as the Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office and Ferndale Communications Officer. However, they also source some stories, such as
[“Man armed with hatchet drives vehicle into food court at Bellis Fair during Police Chase,”](https://bellinghammetronews.com/news/breaking-news/man-armed-with-hatchet-drives-vehicle-into-food-court-at-bellis-fair-during-police-chase/) through unconfirmed sources like police radio or social media groups.
Some
[articles](https://www.facebook.com/BellinghamNews/posts/bellingham-crime-rate-mentioned-on-national-news-featuring-tucker-carlson-and-ti/2066411973541426/) published by Bellingham Metro News articles are also republished by local sources, such as [“Bellingham crime rate mentioned on national news: Bellingham Metro News.”](https://darik.news/washington/bellingham-crime-rate-mentioned-on-national-news-bellingham-metro-news/557211.html) The article appears to have a conservative bias as it cites former [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) host [Tucker Carlson.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) The article also lacks context and statistical evidence to support the claim that Bellingham has a crime spike. It only lists several incidents of theft and burglary without providing information on crime rates over time or in comparison to other cities. In general, the website holds a slight right-leaning editorial bias and is mostly factual in reporting.
