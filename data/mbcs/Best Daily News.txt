Analysis / Bias
In review, the purpose of this website is to encourage Trump supporters to share fake news that connects with their confirmation bias. Every story on this website favors the Trump administration and denigrates liberals. There is significant use of loaded wording such as this:
[Gaffe-A-Day Biden Strikes Again](http://bestdailynews.info/gaffe-a-day-biden-strikes-again/). This story is not sourced to an external link. This website also promotes George Soros conspiracies such as this [America is Under Attack by 187 Groups Funded by George Soros](http://bestdailynews.info/america-is-under-attack-by-187-groups-funded-by-george-soros/). This story is sourced to fake news websites such as [Your News Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/your-news-wire/) and [Humans are Free.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/humans-are-free/) In general, this is an extreme right fake news website from Macedonia.
