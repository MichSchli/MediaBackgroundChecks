Analysis / Bias
In review, Frontiers in Psychology is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to psychology. The journal primarily publishes research such as this
[Assessment of the quality of life in parents of children with ADHD: Validation of the Multicultural Quality of Life in Norwegian pediatric mental health settings](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.638006).
[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
In general, Frontiers in Psychology is a credible scientific journal, as we cannot find any controversy or significant retractions to date. However, Frontiers Media has also
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
