Analysis / Bias
In review, Variety Magazine typically produces original news content about the entertainment industry. Headlines are usually straightforward and low-biased such as this:
[‘Terminator: Dark Fate’ Heading for Lackluster $27 Million Launch](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/box-office-terminator-dark-fate-joker-harriet-1203390926/). Some headlines are slightly sensationalized regarding celebrities, but for the most part, information is sourced accurately and the headlines describe the news story.
Editorially, Variety Magazine reports on politics as it relates to the entertainment industry. In other words, they offer minimal opinions. However, when covering former President Trump they typically are negative and use loaded emotional language such as this:
[Gloria Steinem on Whether Trump Should Be Impeached: ‘He Was Never Elected’](https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/gloria-steinem-trump-impeachment-1203380919/). In general, Variety Magazine reports factually and displays a left-leaning bias when covering politics.
