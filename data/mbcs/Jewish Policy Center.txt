Analysis / Bias
The articles are factual and well-written, with minimal sensationalism and hyperbole. The articles, however, are also heavily pro-Israeli, which is to be expected, and by themselves, they would only have earned JPC a Right Center rating. HOWEVER, where JPC earns its final rating is in its reporting of Israeli-related US news. As an example, in the article “
[A New Realism: America & Israel in the Trump Era](https://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/2018/02/28/new-realism-america-israel-trump-era/),” JPC praises Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It was a move met with alarm by most world leaders, who believed it would impede peace talks. For its decidedly right-wing slant regarding US politics, JPC earns a Right Bias rating.
However, factually, they sometimes rely on poor sources such as the
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/): [How Did The Masses Organize Anti-Israel Protests So Quickly?](https://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/2023/12/05/how-did-the-masses-organize-anti-israel-protests-so-quickly/) Despite this the content on the Jewish Policy Center website is mostly factual.
