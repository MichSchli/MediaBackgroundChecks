History
[Founded in 2016](http://whois.domaintools.com/areomagazine.com), Areo Magazine is a digital-only opinion and analysis magazine. According to their [about page](https://areomagazine.com/about/), Areo focuses “on current affairs — in particular: humanism, culture, politics, human rights, science, and free expression.” They further state Areo “publishes thoughtful essays from a variety of perspectives compatible with broadly liberal and humanist values. Our contributors are intellectually, professionally, and ideologically diverse and include liberals, conservatives, socialists, libertarians, atheists, Christians, Muslims, Jews, and more.”
Areo was founded by
[Malhar Mali](http://www.twitter.com/malharmali) and run by him until June 2018. The current editor is [Helen Pluckrose.](https://areomagazine.com/author/hpluckrose/)
In 2018, Areo Magazine admitted
[perpetrating a hoax](https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/grievance-studies-hoax-not-academic-scandal.html) by submitting fake grievance studies to peer-reviewed journals, some of which were accepted and published.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Areo Magazine primarily publishes articles related to politics, some of which are very long essays. The articles tend to identify with the left, but with caution such as this:
[The Illegitimate President: Donald Trump and the Faking of Democracy](https://areomagazine.com/2018/07/29/the-illegitimate-president-donald-trump-and-the-faking-of-democracy/) and this [Why I’m a Liberal Who Fights the Left, Even in the Age of Trump.](https://areomagazine.com/2018/01/02/why-im-a-liberal-who-fights-the-left-even-in-the-age-of-trump/) This latter article is critical of the far left, stating that they only serve to reinforce the far and alt-right, which is a small group and should not be the primary focus. The author says he is liberal in philosophy but rejects the left’s tactics.
On some issues, Areo leans right; for example, they
[do not report favorably on Feminism](https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/09/what-is-the-point-of-feminism-today/) and report on it frequently. They also question transgenderism as a scientific issue and, at the same time, [support gay marriage.](https://areomagazine.com/2017/09/20/same-sex-marriage-a-case-for-yes/) They also support the consensus of science on climate change. Finally, they favor regulated capitalism rather than [democratic socialism](https://areomagazine.com/?s=climate+change) when it comes to economics. In general, Areo presents ideas and opinions from both sides depending on the issue; however, as a whole, slightly more tend to favor the left (not the progressive left).
