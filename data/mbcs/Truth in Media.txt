Analysis / Bias
In review, Truth in Media attempts to investigate stories that the mainstream media won’t cover. The mainstream media won’t cover these topics because they are not true or have been debunked. For example, Ben Swann has promoted the
[Pizzagate conspiracy theory](http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2018/01/29/cbs46s-ben-swann-fired-after-attempt-to-bring-back-reality-check/) and those related to the [Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre](http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2018/01/29/cbs46s-ben-swann-fired-after-attempt-to-bring-back-reality-check/). Swann has expressed skepticism of the scientific consensus that [vaccines](http://truthinmedia.com/behind-the-scenes-of-truth-in-media-cdc-vaccines-autism/) do not cause [autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). Further, almost all of Truth in Media’s stories favor the right and discredit the left. Truth in Media/Ben Swann also has a [poor track record](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=ben%20swann&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) with fact-checkers.
Further, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Ben Swann and Truth in Media routinely published false information, as seen below in the failed fact checks.
