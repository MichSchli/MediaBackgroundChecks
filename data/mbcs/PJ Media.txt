History
Founded in 2004, PJ Media (originally known as Pajamas Media) is an American online media company and operator of conservative news, opinion, and commentary collaborative blog. Charles Johnson and Roger L. Simon founded PJ Media.
[Johnson and Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_L._Simon) set out to “challenge the mainstream media with a network of citizen-journalists.” The network was primarily made up of conservatives and libertarians. PJ Media also had a TV channel that shutdown operations on May 11, 2016, after its billionaire majority investor Aubrey Chernick pulled out funds.

Analysis / Bias
In review, PJ Media is a popular conservative news and opinion website that garners 13 million+ page views per month. PJ Media uses moderately loaded emotional language in their articles that favor the right, such as this:
[Suspended Pentagon Whistleblower Says FBI’s Russia Probe Was ‘All a Set-Up.’](https://pjmedia.com/trending/suspended-pentagon-whistleblower-says-fbis-russia-probe-was-all-a-set-up/) When it comes to the sourcing of information, they usually use credible right-leaning media sources. However, they also use poor sources such as Jihad Watch, which has been labeled a hate group by the SPLC. Almost all stories reviewed favored the right and denigrated the left through wording and story selection.
