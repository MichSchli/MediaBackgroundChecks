Analysis / Bias
Right News Wire does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left, such as this:
[Ron DeSantis made a one word promise to Dr. Fauci that has him running scared](https://rightnewswire.com/ron-desantis-made-a-one-word-promise-to-dr-fauci-that-has-him-running-scared/). This story utilizes quotes from the questionable [Dan Bongino](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dan-bongino-bias-rating/) show as the source. We also found that they often do not use hyperlinked sourcing on information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Adam Kinzinger stabbed conservatives in the back again with one infuriating comment](https://rightnewswire.com/adam-kinzinger-stabbed-conservatives-in-the-back-again-with-one-infuriating-comment/), and [Marjorie Taylor Greene just triggered every feminist with this comment about the U.S. military](https://rightnewswire.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-just-triggered-every-feminist-with-this-comment-about-the-u-s-military/).
In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing pro-Trump conspiracy theories and propaganda while sometimes using poor sources such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
