Analysis / Bias
The Earth.org article
[“Donald Trump’s Climate Change Record Has Been a Boon for Oil Companies and a Threat to the Planet”](https://earth.org/donald-trump-climate-change/) reviews the former President’s environmental actions. It highlights Trump’s rollback of Obama’s climate policies and references sources like [InsideClimate News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/insideclimate-news/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), both with a Left-Center Bias rating. It also includes quotes from figures such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator.
While the article is factual, the choice of quotes and tone indicate a slight left-leaning bias, such as “handed the oil and gas industry another gift,” “thumbed his nose yet again at climate change,” and “Trump’s relentless attacks could be wholly or partially undone by a new administration and Congress.” These indicate a subtle bias against the Trump administration’s stance on environmental issues.
Following the article on Donald Trump’s climate change policies, another article titled
[“Staggering Clean Energy Growth Is Keeping Path to Limit Global Warming to 1.5C Open, IEA Chief Says”](https://earth.org/staggering-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-path-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c-open-iea-chief-says/) focuses on the growth of clean energy technologies and the efforts required to limit global warming. It cites the International Energy Agency (IEA) and includes data from a non-profit Global Energy Monitor (GEM) report.
The article stresses the need for quick climate action and praises renewable energy growth. Such themes are often linked to left-leaning views that support strong environmental actions. Terms like “staggering growth” and “urgency” suggest a positive bias towards clean energy. Thus, the article has a left-leaning bias.
While Earth.org is generally a pro-science source, it primarily promotes environmental activism, which aligns with a left-leaning perspective. Further, the lack of transparency with funding and ownership lowers their factual reporting rating.
