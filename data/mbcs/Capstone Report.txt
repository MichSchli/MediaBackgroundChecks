History
[Founded in 2006](https://capstonereport.com/about/) as a blog covering Alabama football, the website has now evolved into a far-right Christian and political commentary site. According to their about page, “The editorial team is composed of professional journalists and passionate amateurs, including award-winning editors, writers, and photographers. Content on the site is generated by our writers or published from wire services, including [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), and other partners.” We found no evidence of them republishing from those credible wire services.

Analysis / Bias
The Capstone Report publishes news and commentary heavily focused on religion from a Christian Right perspective and politics from a conservative point of view. Articles and headlines contain loaded emotional wording, especially when reporting on the Southern Baptist Convention, which they view as leftist and globalist:
[Did the SBC lie to help David Platt?](https://capstonereport.com/2022/12/15/did-the-sbc-lie-to-help-david-platt/40412/) and [Woke Southern Baptist Elites created church giving crisis](https://capstonereport.com/2022/12/10/woke-southern-baptist-elites-created-church-giving-crisis/40314/). For perspective on how far right the Capstone Report is, consider that the “woke” Southern Baptist Convention is labeled as an [Anti-LGBTQ hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/03/25/southern-baptist-convention-claims-harbor-no-ill-will-toward-lgbt-people-its-actions) by the [SPLC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/). Regarding sourcing, they sometimes rely on poor sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Editorially, most articles on the website are opinion pieces that strongly favor a Christian Conservative perspective and denigrate the left, such as this
[Weak Joe Biden encourages tyrants to test America](https://capstonereport.com/2021/08/30/weak-joe-biden-encourages-tyrants-to-test-america/36977/). When it comes to the issues, they are opposed to [abortion and gay marriage](https://capstonereport.com/2022/07/20/big-eva-loves-pro-abortion-pro-gay-marriage-supporting-adam-kinzinger/38510/) and opposed to the teaching of [Critical Race Theory](https://capstonereport.com/2021/05/19/mike-stone-50-other-southern-baptists-introduce-resolution-repudiating-critical-race-theory/36057/). Finally, they promote conspiracy theories about George Soros, such as this [Baptist Press lies and denies George Soros connection to Evangelical Immigration Table](https://capstonereport.com/2020/01/09/baptist-press-lies-and-denies-george-soros-connection-to-evangelical-immigration-table/33713/). The Baptist Press [did not lie](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/explainer-erlc-george-soros-and-evangelical-immigration-table/), as Soros did not directly fund the EIT, and a fact-checker has [debunked this story](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/christianity-today-george-soros/).
In general, the Capstone Report holds extreme Christian Nationalist biases, as evidenced by considering the far-right Southern Baptist Convention to be “Woke Globalists.” They also advance conspiracy theories that confirm their Christian Nationalist biases.
