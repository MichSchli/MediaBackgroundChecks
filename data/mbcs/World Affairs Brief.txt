History
[Founded in 2004](http://whois.domaintools.com/worldaffairsbrief.com), World Affairs Brief is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website. According to their [about page](https://www.worldaffairsbrief.com/home/about), “The World Affairs Brief is a weekly news analysis service published by Joel M. Skousen subtitled, “Commentary and Insights on a Troubled World.” Mr. Skousen concentrates on adding back into the news information that the establishment media and governments purposely omit to keep you from knowing the underlying agenda behind their actions or statements. He believes there is a globalist conspiracy to undermine national sovereignty and to create wars and other provocations that will justify a diminution of civil liberties.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, World Affairs Brief is a 100% conspiracy and pseudoscience website. The website features a section dedicated to Government cover-ups. It lists
[9-11](https://www.worldaffairsbrief.com/keytopics/9-11compilation2005.html), [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), [Vince Foster](https://www.worldaffairsbrief.com/keytopics/VinceFoster.html), [the Columbine shooting](https://www.worldaffairsbrief.com/keytopics/Columbine.html), and many more. Under the recommended news sources tab, it lists [Infowars-Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) as a favorite. Under the Daily News Q section, they link to news stories from other sources. Some of the sources they link to are questionable, such as [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and [Lew Rockwell.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/).
Since covid-19, they have focused on promoting vaccine conspiracies, and pseudoscience, such as this
[Pfizer Exec Admits Under Oath: ‘We Never Tested COVID Vaccine Against Transmission](https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/pfizer-exec-admits-under-oath-we-never-tested-covid-vaccine-against-transmission).’ This misleading story is linked to Zerohedge and is not factual, as Pfizer [never made such a claim](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-pfizer-vaccine-transmission-idUSL1N31F20E), to begin with.
In general, this is a tin-foil hat conspiracy website.
