Analysis / Bias
According to a
[Mail & Guardian article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_(South_Africa)) titled “South Africa’s (political) media landscape,” the political positioning of Times Media Group is a “Government watchdog, openly critical of some ANC policies, extensive reporting on corruption and related scandals.” ANC (The African National Congress) is the Republic of South Africa’s governing political party. The political position of ANC is Centre-left.
In review, Times Live uses loaded words in their headlines and articles such as
[“Zuma is going to have his day in court soon, and it’s going to be ugly,’](https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-02-17-zuma-is-going-to-have-his-day-in-court-soon-and-its-going-to-be-ugly/) and they republish stories from their sister publication, The Sunday Times (South Africa). Times Live typically sources [through quotes](https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-05-04-presidency-brings-charges-against-sars-commissioner-tom-moyane/) and rarely links to other sources in their articles. The articles under the Times Select section are subject to a subscription; therefore, we couldn’t review the content.
Their position on US politics is anti-Trump since the President’s “shithole countries” remark. Times Live published an open letter to Donald Trump titled
[“Dear Donald: A letter from the Shithole”.](https://www.timeslive.co.za/ideas/2018-01-12-trump-wins-the-race-to-the-bottom/)
