History
Earth & Sky, also known as
[EarthSky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_%26_Sky) (the still-active website), was a daily radio series that presented information about science and nature. Earth & Sky was broadcast on [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) from 1991 to 2013 and then focused on the web and social media. The information on Earth & Sky comes directly from scientists. The journalists who produced the Earth & Sky radio program and continue to produce the website speak to several scientists each day, dozens each week, and hundreds each year.

Analysis / Bias
Earth & Sky covers news and information related to astronomy and geology. Articles and headlines are primarily free of bias and focus on science, such as this
[Tucana the Toucan is home to the Small Magellanic Cloud](https://earthsky.org/constellations/tucana-the-toucan-small-magellanic-cloud/). They also cover geology/earth sciences such as climate change impacts as seen here [Global climate change may impact crops within 10 years](https://earthsky.org/earth/global-climate-change-crop-impact-10-years/). This story appropriately references [NASA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nasa/).
While they do not offer straight Op-Eds, the website takes a left-leaning perspective in story selection by highlighting the dangers of climate change and inequity, such as this
[Artificial intelligenceâ€™s racial and gender bias problem](https://earthsky.org/human-world/artificial-intelligence-can-be-racist-and-sexist/). Although there is a left-leaning editorial bias, they consistently promote pro-science stories and earn a pro-science rating.
