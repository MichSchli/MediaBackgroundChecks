History
Presidential Hill is a conservative-leaning news and opinion website. According to their
[about page](https://newsglobal.com/about-us/), they claim they are “a fact-based news publication specializing in reports on politics and current events from an objective point of view.”
The website lacks transparency as it does not disclose its conservative leanings or name authors, editors, and ownership. The domain is registered with information redacted for privacy.

Funded by / Ownership
Presidential Hill lacks transparency as they do not provide ownership information. However, the contact page provides a physical mailing address @
[1985 Henderson Rd STE 1156 Columbus, OH 43220](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pak+Mail/@40.0545541,-83.0736699,56m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88388d84b97e5c39:0xa3e179426055c5b3!8m2!3d40.0545979!4d-83.0736413). This address leads to a strip mall and a company called [Pak Mail](https://www.pakmail.com/mailbox-rental), which provides shipping services and personal and business mailbox rentals. It appears Patriotic Post has rented a mailbox with Pak Mail.
Further, when searching the mailing address, we found several other conservative websites linked to this mailbox rental. This is what we have discovered thus far:
These websites have the same design and appear to be owned by the same company/person. Advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Presidential Hill does not conduct original reporting. Instead, they curate news from other sources and add conservative commentary. Articles and headlines feature loaded emotional wording such as this
[CNN Host Gets Attacked By Democrats For Calling Out Biden’s Improper Use Of Troops](https://presidentialhill.com/cnn-host-gets-attacked-by-democrats-for-calling-out-bidens-improper-use-of-troops/). A biased quote from the article reads: “Biden is the fascist. The tweeting loons have it entirely backward.” This story does not provide a source.
Regarding sourcing, most articles do not utilize hyperlinked sourcing which is unacceptable for a web-only publication. In reviewing numerous articles, we found they generally rely on questionable right biased sources such as
[American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/).
Editorially, most stories strongly favor the right, and former President Donald Trump, such as this
[Trump Surges 10 Points After FBI Raid, A Reversal From Expectations](https://presidentialhill.com/trump-surges-10-points-after-fbi-raid-a-reversal-from-expectations/). Our review also found instances of promoting debunked conspiracy theories, such as this [Rancher Says CCP And Bill Gates’ Purchase Of Land Is About Planned Food Shortages](https://presidentialhill.com/rancher-says-ccp-and-bill-gates-purchase-of-land-is-about-planned-food-shortages/). This is debunked [conspiracy theory](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-own-farmland/).
Finally, Presidential Hill has promoted
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://presidentialhill.com/40-of-women-who-get-covid-vaccine-report-changes-to-their-periods/). In general, Presidential Hill is a far-right biased source that promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience that are not rooted in fact.
