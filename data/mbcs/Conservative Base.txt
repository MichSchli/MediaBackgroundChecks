Analysis / Bias
In review, Conservative Base is a news and opinion website with a borderline extreme right wing bias. Headlines contain moderately loaded words and almost all stories are pro-right and anti-left. Not all articles are accurate or they are simply misleading. For example, there is a story on March 20th, 2017 entitled “
[Think Tank Report: Trump’s First 50 Days a Major Victory for Americans](https://conservativebase.com/think-tank-report-trumps-first-50-days-a-major-victory-for-americans/).” In this article they make various evidence based claims about President Trump’s accomplishments in the first 50 days. While what they list is factually accurate from a numbers standpoint, most of it has nothing to do with Trump. Here are some examples:
“In both January and February, U.S. companies added jobs to the economy by leaps and bounds. In January, the numbers were 238,000 jobs added, and in February the figures were 235,000, with wages growing by an average 2.8 percent and unemployment falling to 4.7 percent.”
These numbers are correct, but January job growth is credited to Obama and is the same growth our economy has been experiencing for 6 straight years.
[This has nothing to do with Trump.](http://www.factcheck.org/2017/03/trump-twists-jobs-numbers/)
“The most recent figure for the debt under ex-President Obama was $19.947 trillion, but since then, Trump has subtracted $68 billion — not a bad start for a president who has vowed to cut copious government waste.”
This also has nothing to do with Trump as his budget will not begin until October 2017. These are Obama’s numbers until that time.
[This is mostly false.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/25/donald-trump/why-donald-trumps-tweet-about-decline-national-deb/)
“Since Trump was elected, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged more than 12 percent — greater than 2500 points — to close above 21,000 for the first time ever on March 1.”
While these numbers are again accurate, they ignore the fact that the stock market has grown consistently since 2009. While some of this may be attributed to
[enthusiasm for Trump](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/16/fact-checking-donald-trumps-press-conference/), one cannot claim he did it alone.
