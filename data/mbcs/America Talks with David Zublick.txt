Analysis / Bias
In review, America Talks is a right wing biased website that promotes the Pizzagate conspiracy theory through publishing articles such as
[“BREAKING: Damning Podesta PizzaGate Evidence Unsealed”](https://americatalks.com/politics/breaking-damning-podesta-pizzagate-evidence-unsealed/). They also promote the Seth Rich murder conspiracy by publishing this story: [“Contradictions In Seth Rich Murder Continue To Challenge Hacking Narrative.” ](https://americatalks.com/politics/contradictions-in-seth-rich-murder-continue-to-challenge-hacking-narrative/)
When reporting political news the headlines are sensationalized, such as this
[“MSNBC Caught Lying About ‘Dirty’ Nancy Pelosi ‘Slow-Mo’ Video”](https://americatalks.com/news/msnbc-caught-lying-about-dirty-nancy-pelosi-slow-mo-video/) and [Report: FBI Tapes Show Martin Luther King Jr ‘Laughed’ As Friend Raped Parishioner”.](https://americatalks.com/news/report-fbi-tapes-show-martin-luther-king-jr-laughed-as-friend-raped-parishioner/) America Talks frequently utilizes questionable sources such as the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) and [Zero Hedge,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) as well as factually mixed sites such as the [Washington Free Beacon.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/) Further, according to [factcheck.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/factcheck/) America Talks “ [publish, or have published, bogus content](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/websites-post-fake-satirical-stories/).” In general, America Talks publishes far right content that promotes debunked conspiracies.
