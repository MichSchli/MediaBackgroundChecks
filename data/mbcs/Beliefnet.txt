Analysis / Bias
Before I begin this review, I want to state that this was challenging. Beliefnet could easily fit into our
[conspiracy/pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conspiracy/) category based on many articles supporting creationism and even [angels](http://www.beliefnet.com/inspiration/angels/guardian-angels/do-christians-really-have-guardian-angels.aspx). However, Beliefnet also has very credible content that is well-sourced and minimally biased. Another aspect of this site is that they cover all the major world religions, though there certainly is more information regarding Christianity.
In review, Beliefnet typically uses minimal to moderate loaded language in their articles such as
[Obama Admits He Is A Muslim – In His Own Words! – Video.](http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/watchwomanonthewall/2012/02/obama-admits-he-is-a-muslim-in-his-own-words-video.html#itCEGhCKfPLq04Tz.99) They also usually source properly; however, we found examples of [questionable sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) such as [Lew Rockwell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lew-rockwell/), which has an extreme right-wing bias and has failed fact checks. Beliefnet serves to provide religious news across different religions, but we rate them Right-biased based on favoring Christianity and right-wing ideology.
