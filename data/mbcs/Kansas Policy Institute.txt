History
Launched in 1996,
[Kansas Policy Institute or KPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Policy_Institute) is a Wichita, Kansas-based think tank focusing on state and local policy issues in Kansas and describing itself as an advocate for free-market solutions. The Chairman and co-founder of the Kansas Policy Institute are [George Pearson](https://kansaspolicy.org/board-of-trustees-officers/). He is also a member of the Board of Directors of [Atlas Network](https://www.atlasnetwork.org/news/article/kansas-policy-institute-presents-spirit-of-freedom-award-to-its-chair-and-a), and he also served as a director for the Libertarian [Cato Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/) and the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/institute-for-humane-studies/), among many other organizations. George Pearson, [according](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/charles-koch-political-ascent-jane-mayer-213541) to a [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) article, is a former member of the John Birch Society in Wichita, which has been described as a radical right organization that promotes [conspiracies](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/bringing-back-birch). In this article, sourcing a book written by Clayton A. Coppin, who is a researcher from George Mason University, summarizes Pearson’s arguments “It would be necessary to use ambiguous and misleading names, obscure the true agenda, and conceal the means of control. This is the method that Charles Koch would soon practice in his charitable giving and later in his political actions.” [Dave Trabert](https://kansaspolicy.org/board-of-trustees-officers/) is the President of the Kansas Policy Institute and, [according](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Kansas_Policy_Institute) to [SourceWatch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sourcewatch/), is a member of ALEC’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Task Force and [Barry Poulson](https://kansaspolicy.org/scholars/) and [Jonathan Williams](https://kansaspolicy.org/scholars/) both from KPI, are also associated with the same [ALEC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-legislative-exchange-council-alec/) task force. Poulson as an adviser and Williams on staff as the task force director. “ALEC has pushed for [repealing the Affordable Care Act](https://www.alec.org/model-policy/alec-statement-of-principles-on-repealing-and-replacing-the-affordable-care-act-aca/), has [opposed Medicaid expansion](https://www.alec.org/article/taxpayers-in-every-state-bearing-costs-of-medicaid-expansion/), and has endorsed [rolling back environmental regulations](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/exposing-alec-how-conservative-backed-state-laws-are-all-connected/255869/). Alec [pushed](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/363389-exxon-opposes-alecs-attempt-to-fight-epa-climate-policy) the Trump administration to rescind federal findings that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful, a [move that even ExxonMobil opposes](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/363389-exxon-opposes-alecs-attempt-to-fight-epa-climate-policy).”
The Kansas Policy Institute’s
[mission statement](http://www.defenddemocracy.org/about-fdd/team-overview/dubowitz-mark/) indicates, “We engage citizens and policymakers with research and information to enact public policy solutions that protect the constitutional right to freedom of all Kansans, give them greater access to better educational opportunities, and allow them to keep more of what they earn.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, KPI uses strong emotional language in its headlines, such as “
[19 U.S. Senators promoting tyranny”](https://kansaspolicy.org/19-u-s-senators-promoting-tyranny/). The Kansas Policy Institute utilizes credible right-center biased sources such as the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/); however, they also utilize factually mixed sources such as the [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/) and questionable sources such as the [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/). Most articles on the website favor right-leaning causes such as endorsement of [private/charter schools](https://kansaspolicy.org/what-trumps-education-secretary-could-mean-for-kansas-school-choice/) over the public, [lower taxes and government spending](https://kansaspolicy.org/city-and-county-payrolls-jumped-in-2017/), as well as receiving [funding and endorsement](https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/educational-programs/partner-organizations/) by those who do not support the consensus of science regarding [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/).
