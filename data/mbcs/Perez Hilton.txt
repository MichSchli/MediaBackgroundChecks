Analysis / Bias
In review, Perez Hilton reports celebrity gossip and entertainment news with loaded sensational wording such as this
[Megan Fox & Machine Gun Kelly ARE ‘Hooking Up’ — And She’s ‘Excited’ About It!](https://perezhilton.com/megan-fox-machine-gun-kelly-hooking-up/) and this [Twitter Is Thirsty AF Over Pauly D’s Quarantine Beard!](https://perezhilton.com/pauly-d-quarantine-beard-twitter-thirst/). Reporting usually comes from other sources and is appropriately hyperlinked in the articles. Mainly, article headlines are designed to be hyper-sensational to encourage the reader to click through.
Perez Hilton also reports on politics with a strong left-leaning bias. For example, they frequently denigrate former President Donald Trump, such as this:
[Trump Says The Quiet Part Loud In BONKERS Fox & Friends Interview!](https://perezhilton.com/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-interview-call-coronavirus/). They also go after conservatives such as this [That Didn’t Take Long… Conservatives Are Now Attacking The Florida High School Shooting Survivors…](https://perezhilton.com/parkland-florida-shooting-marjory-stoneman-douglas-high-school-students-david-hogg-emma-gonzalez/) In general, Perez Hilton is a clickbait celebrity gossip site that is not always factual and lacks transparency.
