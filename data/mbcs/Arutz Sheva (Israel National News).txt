Analysis / Bias
Arutz Sheva publishes news with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Biden to Rivlin: Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/308909). The website frequently promotes Zionism, such as this [‘Zionism is alive on the hills of Samaria](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/308548).’
When reporting international news, Arutz Sheva uses staff writers as well as
[Reuters](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/twitter-star-of-david/). More articles tend to favor former president Donald Trump/Republicans through more positive wording and story selection.
Editorially, they promote a strong pro-Israeli Zionist bias. Further, they report favorably on Prime Minister Netanyahu;
[Netanyahu sounds off on Bennett: ‘Too soft on Iran’](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/308576). Finally, Arutz Sheva was found by [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) to have used a deepfake photo for one of their journalists.
