Analysis / Bias
Just One Focus consistently promotes fringe theories and alternative narratives that challenge mainstream beliefs, positioning it as a far-right conspiracy site. The website’s content covers controversial topics spanning from global financial systems to government actions and health-related conspiracies.
For instance, the video
[“Australia, What President Trump is Doing Globally Will Shock You! Just Say ‘Thank You'”](https://www.justonefocus.org/australia-what-president-trump-is-doing-globally-will-shock-you-just-say-thank-you/) reflects the site’s far-right leaning. This article emphasizes President Trump’s actions on a global scale, portraying him as a disruptive force against perceived threats. Additionally, it suggests collusion between banks and globalist organizations, aligning with far-right conspiracies about corrupt elites controlling financial systems.
Furthermore, the website promotes Tucker Carlson’s
[exclusive interview](https://www.justonefocus.org/tucker-carlsons-exclusive-and-historic-interview-with-vladimir-putin/) with Vladimir Putin by praising the interview as “the most powerful and unforgettable event of our time.” The site aligns with [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tuckercarlson-com-bias/), a prominent right-wing figure. This endorsement reinforces the site’s ideological stance, emphasizing its support for conservative perspectives and figures.
In addition to its promotion of political conspiracies and support for right-wing figures like Tucker Carlson, Just One Focus also promotes weather-related conspiracies, further solidifying its far-right orientation. Podcasts published under “Weather Genocide,” such as “Chemtrails/Weather Manipulation,” propagate theories suggesting nefarious activities behind natural phenomena.
For example, the podcast
[“HAARP Microwave – The REAL Cause of Climate Change! Fires, Earthquakes, Tsunamis”](https://www.justonefocus.org/haarp-microwave-the-real-cause-of-climate-change-fires-earthquakes-tsunamis/) promotes the theory that weather events are manipulated by technologies like HAARP (High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program), attributing natural disasters to deliberate human intervention.
Similarly,
[“Chemtrails/Weather Manipulation: Lab Tests Show Horrific Levels of Toxic Heavy Metals in Water!”](https://www.justonefocus.org/chemtrails-weather-manipulation-lab-tests-show-horrific-levels-of-toxic-heavy-metals-in-water/) and [“Dramatic Increase in Chemtrails Causing Alzheimer’s, Destroying Aquatic Life”](https://www.justonefocus.org/dramatic-increase-in-chemtrails-causing-alzheimers-destroying-aquatic-life-humanity-being-attacked-on-every-front/) propagate the idea that chemicals are being intentionally sprayed into the atmosphere from airplanes, commonly referred to as “chemtrails” which suggest that these chemtrails are causing harmful effects on human health and the environment. For more information about chemtrails and what they entail, please visit the following link: [What Are Chemtrails? – HowStuffWorks](https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/modern/what-are-chemtrails.htm).
These weather-related conspiracies align with far-right narratives that distrust scientific consensus and governmental institutions, often portraying them as malevolent actors working against the interests of the general population. By promoting such theories, Just One Focus further establishes itself as a far-right conspiracy site, catering to an audience receptive to fringe beliefs and alternative explanations for natural phenomena.
In general, Just One Focus completely lacks credibility as they routinely promote far-right conspiracies and debunked pseudoscience. Essentially, this is an Australian QAnon website.
