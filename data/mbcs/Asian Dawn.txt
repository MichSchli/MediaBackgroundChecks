Analysis / Bias
Asian Dawn uses pictures as the main feature of the story, with the pages mainly covered by photographs. Asian Dawn’s reporting is generally biased towards right-wing perspectives and tends to rely on sensational headlines and use loaded language to manipulate readers’ opinions. Many stories report on crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans, like this
[Asian Woman Paralyzed After Black Man Body Slams Her During Robbery](https://www.asian-dawn.com/2023/03/13/asian-woman-paralyzed-after-black-man-body-slams-her-during-robbery/). This story relies on video and a local TV station for sourcing.
In review, Asian Dawn uses emotionally loaded sensational headlines such as
[“12-Year-Old Boy Arrested in Unprovoked Stabbing in Muni Bus.”](https://www.asian-dawn.com/2023/03/15/12-year-old-boy-arrested-in-unprovoked-stabbing-in-muni-bus/) The source for this story is a Twitter post. The article compares the Asian-American and African-American communities’ economic status and educational achievement. However, the comparison is oversimplified, and the writing appears to have a biased perspective that favors Asian Americans.
Another article,
[“Biden Backtracks On Taiwan Military Support for 3rd Time,”](https://www.asian-dawn.com/2022/05/26/biden-backtracks-on-taiwan-military-support-for-3rd-time/) portrays President Biden as flip-flopping on the issue of military support for Taiwan, using loaded language such as “backtracks,” and criticizes President Biden, which lacks a balanced perspective.
Editorially, a search for stories where they mention former President Trump is usually favorable such as this
[Trump Now Has a 70% Chance of Winning Re-Election](https://www.asian-dawn.com/2020/11/04/trump-now-has-a-70-chance-of-winning-re-election/) while framing Democrats negatively [Biden Nominee Refuses to Say Discrimination Against Asians is Wrong](https://www.asian-dawn.com/2022/09/26/biden-nominee-refuses-to-say-discrimination-against-asians-is-wrong/). In general, Asian Dawn holds a strong right-leaning bias, completely lacks transparency, and promotes sensationalized one-sided content favorable to Asian Americans.
