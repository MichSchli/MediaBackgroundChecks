History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/theflipside.io), The Flip Side is a website that produces a daily newsletter covering both left and right perspectives on news stories. According to their [about page](https://www.theflipside.io/about-us), “The Flip Side is on a mission to help bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives.” They further state, “It’s hard to convince liberals to watch [Fox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) or conservatives to watch [MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/). But if everyone takes 5 minutes a day to read The Flip Side, we’ll have a starting point when talking to our friends and neighbors.”
The current editors are Annafi Wahid and Jihan Varisco. You can view their masthead

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Flip Side produces a daily newsletter that focuses on one primary topic. They then break this news down into left and right columns that feature summaries of Op-eds from media sources or writers who fall on either side. The Flip Side uses several third-party resources to determine bias, such as Allsides,
[Pew](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/), and Media Bias Fact Check.
The Flip Side does not produce original content or commentary but rather curates news from other sources. An example of a daily newsletter is as follows. On December 9th, the news story of the day was “
[Impeachment](https://www.theflipside.io/archives/impeachment-2).” The newsletter provides snippets of the news from the least biased sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Next, they provide columns called “From the Left” and “From the Right.” Below this column, they list a general left and right-wing perspective for the topic. In this case, they indicate that the Left favors impeachment and the right are not. Finally, they publish snippets/summaries of op-eds and news reports from a wide variety of sources. For example, on the Left, they use [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and the [Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/). On the Right, they utilize [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), and [Hot Air](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hot-air/).
