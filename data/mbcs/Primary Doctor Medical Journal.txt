History
[Founded in October 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/pdmj.org), the Primary Doctor Medical Journal (PDMJ) is an anonymously run Coronavirus misinformation website. They claim to be peer-reviewed and state on their [about page](https://pdmj.org/about/), “The Journal focuses on topics primarily related to public health and preventive and natural medicine.”
The website 100% lacks transparency as they do not name owners, editors, peer-reviewers, or location. However, all supposed peer-reviewed studies are written by Colleen Huber, who is not an actual medical doctor but rather a
[Naturopath](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/cancer-quack-colleen-huber-sues-britt-hermes-over-criticism/) who takes [anti-vaccination positions](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and advocates for [natural cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), which does not have supportive evidence for effectiveness.
Funded by / Ownership
Primary Doctor Medical Journal does not disclose ownership or any names associated with the website; however, it appears that Colleen Huber is the primary publisher. Further, there does not appear to be a source of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Primary Doctor Medical Journal (PDMJ) claims to be a peer-reviewed medical journal. In fact, it is a website that publishes studies and research by Naturopath Colleen Huber, who runs a clinic that promotes natural cancer cures. The website’s focus is
[anti-mask](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) and lockdown propaganda as it relates to Covid-19. For example, one of their [research articles](https://pdmj.org/papers/masks_false_safety_and_real_dangers_part3/) promotes that wearing a mask is dangerous as it causes hypoxia and hypercapnia. [This is not true](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/wearing-face-masks-does-not-cause-hypercapnia-or-affect-the-immune-system/). All of the papers on the website promote the dangers of mask-wearing. Another study promotes that lockdowns do not decrease deaths, [which is again not true](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-lockdowns-idUSKBN2842WS). All of the six so-called research papers on the website are either misleading or false. Therefore, the Primary Doctor Medical Journal is not credible or legitimate based on promoting quackery level pseudoscience related to Coronavirus.
