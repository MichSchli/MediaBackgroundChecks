Analysis / Bias
Roll Call is a solid “just the facts” news source featuring a writing staff with an impressive set of credentials in political journalism. The articles are well-sourced, and the information is presented “as is” with very minimal bias, such as this
[Trump to skip Poland trip and monitor Hurricane Dorian as it heads toward Florida](https://www.rollcall.com/news/whitehouse/trump-skip-poland-trip-monitor-hurricane-dorian). While looking through the articles, one, in particular, caught my attention. The article addressed the much-hyped, on both sides, possibility of using National Guard troops to assist ICE in finding and deporting illegal immigrants. There is no real substance to the claim at this point, which came from an early draft of a “what if” style memo that never reached any official level. I’ve read numerous articles on the issue, and Roll Call’s article was the fairest and least biased I have seen.
The only “negative” I found was in the editorial content. For a site that is so balanced in other areas, the editorials reveal a slight left bias. While I understand that op-ed pages are just opinions, I wouldn’t mind seeing some opposing views. Still, if you stick with the articles, I have to say that Roll Call is the best site I’ve found in quite some time for fair, factual, and informative journalism.
