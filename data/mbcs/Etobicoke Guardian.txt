In review, Etobicoke Guardian uses low biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Looking to get your COVID-19 shot? Here is a list of pop-up vaccination clinics in Toronto this week](https://www.thestar.com/local-toronto-scarborough/news/2022/08/04/looking-to-get-your-covid-19-shot-here-is-a-list-of-pop-up-vaccination-clinics-in-toronto-this-week.html). The national news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
