History
[Founded in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulwark_(website)) by Charlie Sykes and William Kristol, The Bulwark is a news and opinion website featuring many staff from the now-defunct right-leaning [Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/). The Weekly Standard editor-in-chief Charlie Sykes said, “the murder of the Standard made it urgently necessary to create a home for rational, principled, fact-based center-right voices who Trumpism did not cow.” [Read our profile on USA Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Bulwark is a
[Defending Democracy Together Institute](https://www.defendingdemocracytogether.org/) project, a 501(c)(3) conservative advocacy group led in part by The Weekly Standard co-founder [William Kristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kristol). The Bulwark and its parent company Defending Democracy Together Institute, are funded through donations. [According](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/defending-democracy-together-institute/) to the right-leaning [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/), Defending Democracy Together is a right-center advocacy organization primarily funded by the left-center [Hewitt Foundation](https://www.hewittfoundation.com/) that is described as a “nonprofit dedicated to incubating and assembling pro-democracy voices. . . created by conservatives uncomfortable with the flamboyant rhetoric that can come from President Trump.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Bulwark has essentially started where the Weekly Standard left off, which is as a conservative publisher who did not support former President Trump. Please do not confuse this with a left-biased source. They are a right-leaning source and reject most progressive and mainstream democratic ideals. For example, they use moderately loaded words that denigrate Hillary Clinton:
[If Hillary Clinton Doesn’t Shut Up, She’ll Re-Elect Trump](https://thebulwark.com/if-hillary-clinton-doesnt-shut-up-shell-re-elect-trump/). Despite the loaded headline, this story is properly sourced to [Know Your Meme](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/know-your-meme/) and the [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)
Besides original reporting, the website also features a news aggregator that sources various left, least biased and right-leaning sources. In general, this is a moderate right-leaning source that does not support Trump. It might not be the Weekly Standard 2.0, but it is pretty close and a credible source for right-leaning information.
