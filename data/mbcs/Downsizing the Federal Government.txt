History
According to their
[about page](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/about): “Downsizing the Federal Government is a project of the [Cato Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/). Scholars at Cato believe that cutting the federal budget would enhance personal freedom, increase prosperity, and leave a positive fiscal legacy to the next generation. This website is designed to help policymakers and the public understand where federal spending goes and how to reform each government department.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Downsizing the Federal Government is owned and published by the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. The Cato Institute is a 501(c)(3) Non-profit think tank. According to their
[about page](https://www.cato.org/about), “Cato receives approximately 80 percent of its funding through tax-deductible contributions from individuals, many of whom are responding to informative, direct mail solicitations and program updates.” Cato offers an [annual report](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/2017-annual-report.pdf) that shows the percentages of money received and their [IRS 990 form](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/cato-irs-form-990-2017.pdf). The Cato Institute is [funded](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Cato_Institute) by various organizations, including the [Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation,](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Lynde_and_Harry_Bradley_Foundation) [Charles Koch Foundation](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Charles_Koch_Foundation), and [Sarah Scaife Foundation.](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Sarah_Scaife_Foundation) They further state, “The creation of this website was made possible by the generosity of the Opportunity Foundation, the Searle Freedom Trust, and the Woodford Family Foundation.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, Downsizing the Federal Government is a libertarian blog that heavily sources the Cato Institute. There is minimal use of loaded words in headlines and articles such as this:
[Federal Spending Rescission](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/federal-spending-rescission). Other sources used on this blog are the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) and the [Stimson Center.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stimson-center/) A [factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=downsizinggovernment.org&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals they have not failed any fact checks. Like Cato, Downsizing the Federal Government recognizes anthropogenic [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) but offers the right-wing perspective of free-market solutions.
