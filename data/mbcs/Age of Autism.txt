History
Founded in 2015, Age of Autism is an anti-vaccination website promoting pseudoscience. According to their
[Mission page](https://www.ageofautism.com/a-welcome-from-dan-olmste.html), “We are published to give voice to those who believe autism is an environmentally induced illness, that it is treatable, and that children can recover.” Based on science, autism is not environmentally induced and is not curable.

Funded by / Ownership
Age of Autism is owned by Autism Age, a nonprofit organization based in Connecticut. The website is funded through donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Age of Autism’s whole premise promotes the false premise that
[vaccines cause Autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). The evidence for this assessment comes from [one page](https://www.ageofautism.com/the-vaccine-autism-link.html) on the website that details their pseudo-hypothesis. Here are some quotes from this page: “Age of Autism embraces the belief expressed by the great Bernie Rimland that “the autism epidemic is real, and excessive vaccinations are the cause.” “ [Vaccines are causing the autism epidemic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). Exactly how that is taking place is subject to much discussion both within and without the vaccine safety community – again, vaccine injury denialists claim it never happens.” Based on the consensus of science, the evidence is that vaccines [are not linked to autism](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html).
They also frequently reference other anti-vaccination sources, such as
[Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), which routinely fails fact checks for false claims. In general, the Age of Autism often promotes false and misleading information regarding vaccines.
