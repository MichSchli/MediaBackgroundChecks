Analysis / Bias
The Tennessee Lookout publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Louisiana. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects Tennesseans. Articles and headlines promote liberal perspectives through moderate, loaded language
[Biden appoints Nashville businessman Bill Freeman to Fulbright Board](https://tennesseelookout.com/briefs/biden-appoints-nashville-businessman-bill-freeman-to-fullbright-board/).

Editorially, opinion pieces favor the left, such as this
[Few competitive races, apathy, lack of investment: the conundrum of low voter participation](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/10/27/few-competitive-races-apathy-lack-of-investment-the-conundrum-of-low-voter-participation/). On the issues, the Tennessee Lookout promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change. Finally, they frequently report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [Peddling poison: Donald Trump follows long line of demagogues](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/11/17/peddling-poison-donald-trump-follows-long-line-of-demagogues/). The Tennessee Lookout generally reports news factually; however, story selection and op-eds strongly favor a liberal perspective.
