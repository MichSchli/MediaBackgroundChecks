History
The Chicago Reporter is a monthly periodical from Chicago, Illinois, USA. Founded in 1972, it covers poverty and race issues. According to their
[about page](https://www.chicagoreporter.com/about/), “The Reporter serves a critical role in the city and nation by focusing the power of investigative reporting on issues of inequality that rarely receive a thorough and regular examination by mainstream media organizations. Our core areas of coverage are criminal justice, affordable housing and economic development, jobs, and transportation.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
