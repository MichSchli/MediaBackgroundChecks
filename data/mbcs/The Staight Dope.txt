Analysis / Bias
The Straight Dope covers a wide range of topics; we reviewed the article titled
[“Straight Dope 3/24/2023: What was neoliberalism, is it dead, and was it really so bad?”](https://boards.straightdope.com/t/straight-dope-3-24-2023-what-was-neoliberalism-is-it-dead-and-was-it-really-so-bad/981595) In this article, Cecil Adams provides an overview of neoliberalism. Based on the article’s critique of neoliberalism, the author leans towards a left-leaning perspective. The linkage of neoliberalism to the rise of Trumpism and the emphasis on issues like job losses, community disintegration, widening income inequality, and an inadequate social safety net is often highlighted by those on the left.
The phrase “We all know how that worked out…” contrasts the benefits of globalization for the educated elite with its negative impact on blue-collar workers, emphasizing the disparity. Another quote from the article reads, “Of course, neoliberalism was bad. It’s what gave us
[Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/).” This statement directly links neoliberalism to the rise of Donald Trump, suggesting a negative view of both.
Regarding sourcing, the article hyperlinks to trade.gov,
[Medium](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/medium/), [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/), and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/). Another article, [“The U.S. goes fascist. How do you escape?”](https://www.straightdope.com/21344398/the-u-s-goes-fascist-how-do-you-escape) by Cecil Adams, dated 2016, is presented in a Q&A format, addressing concerns about a potential fascist takeover of the United States. The tone is satirical. For example, the title hints at a significant U.S. political shift and uses emotionally loaded language. The content implies skepticism towards Trump’s leadership, especially with phrases like “unqualified bully as chief exec.” The article also expresses concerns about the potential persecution of Muslim Americans, emphasizing the fears of minority group mistreatment during that period.
In general, the website is fact-based; however, message boards may contain information this not factual or linked to poor sources. Politically, Straight Dope content and its users tend to favor the left.
