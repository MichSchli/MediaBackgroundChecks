In review, the primary focus of UNEP is combating climate change. Articles typically feature low biased wording such as this:
[Ten years of climate neutrality for The UN Environment Programme](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/ten-years-climate-neutrality-un-environment-programme). UNEP had faced criticism for promoting [climate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) disasters, such as in 1989 when they claimed disaster would occur within [30 years](http://archive.is/S5kU6). Recently, UNEP has followed a more pro-science objective regarding climate change.
