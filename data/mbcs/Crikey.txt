Analysis / Bias
In review, Crikey publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as “
[Dutton opens door to new surveillance of journalists via foreign orders](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/05/15/dutton-surveillance-journalist-foreign-orders/).” This article criticizes Home Affairs Minister Dutton with strong emotional wording such as “Up against such government goons, journalists need all the protection they can get.” Crikey also publishes articles that are critical of the Labor party, such as this [“Albanese will have to confront a collapse in the progressive vote.”](https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/05/24/anthony-albanese-labor-leadership/) A quote from the article reads, “Labor MPs have to settle for doing the only thing losers can do post-election — pick a new leader.” Crikey generally uses credible sources such as aph.gov.au, [weforum.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/) (World Economic Forum), and [abc.net.au.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news-australia/)
Editorially, they are anti-establishment with articles critical of corporations such as
[“Millionaires’ factory delivers the goods again as banks hit by $3.5b in bad debt”](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/05/08/banks-debt-macquarie-covid-19/). Reporting on immigration focuses on Government and employer exploitation of migrants and refugees, [“The illegal immigrants our government is all too happy to overlook.”](https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/07/23/illegal-immigrants-border-control-visas/) They also report negatively on racism and Nazism with this coverage of the Charlottesville incident: [“Know your Nazis: these are the people outing far-right extremists online.”](https://www.crikey.com.au/2017/08/15/know-your-nazis-these-are-the-people-outing-far-right-extremists-online/) Finally, they are critical of News Corp which owns numerous right-leaning media outlets in Australia: [“News Corp’s abuse of power must be exposed — and stopped](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/04/03/news-corps-abuse-of-power/).”
Although Crikey is critical of the left-leaning labor party, its criticism is often directed at their inaction or not fighting hard enough for workers: “
[Labor needs to fight for democracy and a more radical plan.](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/03/27/labor-radical-plan-coronavirus/)” They also support other left-leaning issues such as the dangers presented by [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); Vulnerable [ Australians will bear the brunt of climate change unless we act](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/02/20/vulnerable-australians-will-bear-the-brunt-of-climate-change-unless-we-act/) as well as negative reporting on Conservatives who oppress LGBTQ: [Religious freedom report is a culture war disaster](https://www.crikey.com.au/2018/12/14/religious-freedom-report/). Generally, this is a highly factual publication that leans strongly left through progressive editorial positions.
