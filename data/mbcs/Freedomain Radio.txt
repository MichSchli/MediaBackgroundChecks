Analysis / Bias
According to the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), Stefan Molyneux is aligned with the [Alt-right](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux), and a “skilled propagandist and an effective communicator within the racist “alt-right” and pro-Trump ranks, his promotion of scientific racism and eugenics to a large and growing audience is a serious concern.” They also state, “Molyneux has been delivering “race realist” propaganda, based on pseudo-scientific sources.”
According to the
[Right-Leaning Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) [YouTube Bans White Supremacists Stefan Molyneux, Richard Spencer, David Duke](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/06/29/youtube-bans-white-supremacists-stefan-molyneux-richard-spencer-david-duke/?sh=310c29205ff1). With this said, we will review the content of the website.
The Freedomain website consists of links to podcasts and videos by Mr. Molyneux and a blog of his writings. Our focus will be on his blog.
Unfortunately, the blog links to mostly videos of Mr. Molyneux or those who support his debunked racial theories. For example, this blog post-Human
[ Intelligence (IQ) – Stefan Molyneux Interviews 17 World-Renowned Experts in the Field of Human Intelligence](https://www.freedomain.com/2020/07/14/iq/), interviews people who subscribe to his racial realist theories. Racial Realism is also known as [Scientific Racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism), which is utilized by those who wish to show scientific evidence to justify white supremacy. However, it has been thoroughly debunked by the consensus of science [The Disturbing Resilience of Scientific Racism](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/disturbing-resilience-scientific-racism-180972243/).
In general, the tone of the podcasts and videos is a mix of alt-right libertarianism, racism, and misogyny coated in a veneer of Mr. Molyneux’s brand of self-help philosophy. FR has also been described as a cult as Mr. Molyneux encourages followers to sever ties with their
[family of origin](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult) and instead form new ties of their own choosing.
