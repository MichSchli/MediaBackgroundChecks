Analysis / Bias
In review, NHK World publishes stories with emotionally loaded language and appears to be critical of the Abe Government such as this
[ “Japanese government forced to walk back on attempt to pass prosecutor retirement law”](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1099/) and [“Did the state of emergency declaration come too late?”](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1029/). When it comes to sourcing, NHK World typically uses quotes and rarely hyperlinks.
Editorially, NHK World does not publish opinion pieces; however, when covering USA politics, they have an unfavorable opinion of President Trump:
[Survey suggests growing concern among Japanese at prospect of Trump re-election](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1096/). They also take left-leaning positions, such as concern for [climate change ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/)and support for [LGBTQ rights](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/385/). In general, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning bias in story selection.
