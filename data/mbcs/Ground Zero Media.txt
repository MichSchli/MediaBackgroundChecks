Analysis / Bias
Ground Zero Media, created by Clyde Lewis, frequently engages with conspiracy theories and paranormal topics. It’s known for content that often aligns with
[right-wing ideologies,](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Clyde_Lewis) including climate change denial and Deep State theories. Lewis’s approach, mixing skepticism towards mainstream narratives with extreme theories like COVID-19 denialism and microchip conspiracies, has led to criticism for spreading misinformation and fear-mongering.
In our review, we have examined several articles that reflect these themes and ideologies. These pieces cover a range of topics central to Lewis’s conspiracy-oriented approach, including discussions around global conspiracies and the implications of technological advancements such as microchipping in the context of transhumanism. This examination provides a deeper insight into the nature of the content and the underlying biases.
The article
[“12/7/23: SESONCHOSIS – CRUSHING THE SERPENTS HEAD W/ ATHEN CHIMENTI”](https://groundzeromedia.org/12-7-23-sesonchosis-crushing-the-serpents-head-w-athen-chimenti/) discusses various esoteric and astrological theories, concepts like the celestial significance of the constellation Ophiuchus, the implications of numerology and the number 13, and historical perspectives on timekeeping and calendar systems. It leans more towards speculative theories, catering to audiences interested in esoteric and speculative narratives rather than objective reporting.
Similarly,
[7/20/17: SPACE: 1969 – A NEW ANGLE HAS LANDED”](https://groundzeromedia.org/720-space-1969-a-new-angle-has-landed/) explores various conspiracy theories related to the Apollo 11 moon landing, including Masonic rituals and hidden messages, paralleling platforms like [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and [The Blaze.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/) This content generally lacks mainstream scientific backing, aligning more with pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. [“2/17/20: TRUMP AND THE QUANTUM WAGER”](https://groundzeromedia.org/2-17-20-trump-and-the-quantum-wager/) discusses speculative theories about time travel and secret societies, characteristic of conspiracy-focused content where speculation often overshadows factual accuracy.
The article
[“9/1/22: HAVE YOU CHIPPED THE CHILDREN?”](https://groundzeromedia.org/9-1-22-have-you-chipped-the-children/) discusses microchipping children in the context of augmented reality and transhumanism. It speculates future technological implications and ethical concerns and aligns with the platform’s speculative discussions. Furthermore, the [World Economic Forum (WEF)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/) reference feeds into common conspiracy theories about elite control, fitting within broader narratives of powerful groups influencing world events. These theories lack substantial evidence and are often speculative.
Lastly,
[“9/27/19: MISSION IMPEACHABLE” ](https://groundzeromedia.org/9-27-19-mission-impeachable/)offers a perspective on globalism and former President Trump’s impeachment, critiquing the process as politically motivated and part of a larger globalist agenda. This article also aligns with the platform’s focus on conspiracy theories and political manipulation.
In general, Ground Zero Media holds far-right perspectives and often blends esoteric beliefs, speculative history, and astrological theories without substantial empirical evidence. Such content typically aligns with pseudoscientific narratives and can contribute to the spread of misinformation.
