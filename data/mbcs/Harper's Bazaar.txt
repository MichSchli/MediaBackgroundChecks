Analysis / Bias
Harper’s Bazaar publishes short and long-form articles about women’s fashion, culture, and lifestyle. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded wording, such as this
[The “Great Replacement Theory” Was Never “Fringe](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40036822/the-great-replacement-theory-america/).” All the articles reviewed were properly sourced from credible media sources such as [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). While stories that pertain to fashion tend to be low-biased “ [Bergdorf Goodman Pays Homage to ’70s Fashion in a New Campaign with Denée Benton,”](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a39729485/bergdorf-goodman-campaign-the-expressionists-1970s-denee-benton-interview/) those related to politics support a progressive liberal perspective.
The website also republishes articles from other Hearst properties like
[Esquire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/esquire-magazine/) and [Cosmopolitan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cosmopolitan/).
Editorially, Harper’s Bazaar does not have a dedicated opinion section; however, they publish stories related to politics and provide commentary from a liberal perspective under the politics category. For example, many stories report negatively on the right such as this
[Ghosting the Confederacy](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a37991658/ghosting-the-confederacy/), while reporting favorably on the left, like this [Domestic Workers Deserve Rights, Too](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a39936731/domestic-workers-sexual-harassment-assault-bill-of-rights/). Further, many articles in the political category favor issues supported by the left such as [abortion rights](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a37455846/texas-passes-most-restrictive-abortion-law/), [equal pay for women](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40034235/us-womens-soccer-team-reaches-equal-pay-agreement/), and [anti-racism](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40036822/the-great-replacement-theory-america/). In general, Harper’s Bazaar reports news from a left-leaning perspective but does not appropriately label opinion content.
