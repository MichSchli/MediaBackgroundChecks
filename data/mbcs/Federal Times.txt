Analysis / Bias
Federal Times publishes news and information geared toward U.S. government managers. They rarely utilize loaded emotional wording such as this
[How the pandemic changed federal hiring](https://www.federaltimes.com/management/hr/2021/06/02/how-the-pandemic-changed-federal-hiring/). The website also publishes political news with minimal bias, such as this [Watchdogs would get subpoena power under a bipartisan bill](https://www.federaltimes.com/federal-oversight/watchdogs/2021/05/25/watchdogs-would-get-subpoena-power-under-a-bipartisan-bill/). Finally, they also republish news from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and always properly source information.
Editorially, op-eds tend to be reasonably balanced; however, some use emotive language such as this
[The delusion of postal profits](https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2021/02/23/the-delusion-of-postal-profits/). In general, news from Federal Times is factual and low-biased.
