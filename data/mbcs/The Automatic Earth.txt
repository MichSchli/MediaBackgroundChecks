Analysis / Bias
The Automatic Earth publishes original blog posts with loaded wording such as this
[Institutionalization on Steroids](https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2021/06/institutionalization-on-steroids/). This story reports negatively on [mask-wearing](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/), Anthony Fauci, and vaccines as it relates to Covid-19. In other words, it promotes pseudoscience. In fact, most recent stories promote pseudoscience and/or conspiracy theories related to anti-vaccination propaganda related to Covid-19, such as [The Ethics of Child Vaccinations](https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2021/06/the-ethics-of-child-vaccinations/).
The blog also links to external articles that read like a whoâ€™s who of conspiracy and questionable sources such as
[RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), [The National Pulse](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-national-pulse/), and the [OffGuardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/offguardian/). In general, The Automatic Earth is an unreliable site that lacks transparency and promotes anti-vaccine pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
