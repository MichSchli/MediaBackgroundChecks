Analysis / Bias
In review, the Poynter website features news related to the press and news industry. Headlines utilize mild to moderate loaded emotional language such as this:
[Across the world, politicians promote conspiracy theories to get ahead](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/across-the-world-politicians-promote-conspiracy-theories-to-get-ahead/). This story is properly sourced to scientific studies as well as the Least Biased [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Poynter also established the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which established a [code of principles](https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-fact-checkers-code-of-principles/) for fact-checking. In order to be a signatory of the IFCN, a media source must apply and adhere to its guidelines. Further, Poynter owns the fact-checker [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), which is also a part of the IFCN. In general, Poynter reports news with low bias and proper sourcing.
Failed Fact Checks
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=poynter&gsc.sort=) reveals they have not failed a fact check. However, in May of 2019, Poynter published an article called [UnNews](https://web.archive.org/web/20190501173436/https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/unreliable-news-index/), which listed 515 media sources deemed unreliable. This article was met with [criticism](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/441959-poynter-pulls-blacklist-of-unreliable-news-websites-after-backlash) due to the list containing some biased but credible sources. Within two days, Poynter [retracted the article](https://www.poynter.org/letter-from-the-editor/2019/letter-from-the-editor/) and issued an apology. Media Bias Fact Check covered this story, which you can read [here](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2019/05/04/poynter-did-the-right-thing/).
