Analysis / Bias
In review, Hot Air publishes original conservative commentary and curated news from other sources such as
[NBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and other Townhall Media properties.
Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[Prime Minister Blackface: It’s Time To Ban Assault Rifles](https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2019/09/20/prime-minister-blackface-time-ban-assault-rifles/). This story is properly sourced to the [CBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Story selection favors the right and usually denigrates the left, such as this:
[Shocker: Another Member Of Democratic Practice Squad Pulls Out Of Primary Fight](https://hotair.com/archives/ed-morrissey/2019/09/20/shocker-another-member-democratic-practice-squad-pulls-primary-fight/). Again, this story is properly sourced to the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/). Although Hot Air does not report negatively on former [President Trump](https://hotair.com/?s=trump), they also do not praise him like many other right-leaning sources. They have also reported favorably on [gay issues](https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2019/09/17/broke-bake-cake-woke-make-invitations/), and former editor Allahpundit is a proclaimed [atheist](https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2019/09/06/buttigieg-abortion-parts-bible-say-life-begins-breath-know/).
In general, Hot Air presents news with a right-leaning bias and typically sources its information properly; however, some of its curated news comes from sources that we have rated
[questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) or factually mixed.
