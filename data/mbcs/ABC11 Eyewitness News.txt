Analysis / Bias
In review, ABC11 has a left-center bias in reporting coverage and story word choices such as: “
[Artists hang Ku Klux’ Klowns’ from tree to protest white nationalism in Virginia](http://abc11.com/politics/ku-klux-klowns-hung-to-protest-white-nationalism-/2387660/)” and “ [Trump administration to review and replace Obama rules on campus sex assault](http://abc11.com/politics/trump-administration-to-end-obama-rules-on-campus-sex-assault/2387773/).” ABC11 is well-sourced as they use credible news sources such as the [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds, but reporting on politics tends to lean slightly left.
