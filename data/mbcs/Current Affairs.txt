Analysis / Bias
In review, Current Affairs reports on politics and culture with a left-leaning bias in story selection. There is the moderate use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[FREEDOM-LOVING AMERICANS SHOULD DEMAND UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE.](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/05/freedom-loving-americans-should-demand-universal-healthcare) This long-form article is well researched and perfectly sourced to highly credible information. In another article, [HOW THE LEFT SHOULD THINK ABOUT TRADE](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/05/how-the-left-should-think-about-trade), there is again excellent sourcing of information. In general, most stories on Current Affairs favor the political left by endorsing policy and Democratic politicians. However, it is highly factual through proper sourcing.
