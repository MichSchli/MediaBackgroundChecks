Analysis / Bias
In review, under the “Black Business Spotlight” section, they promote Black Entrepreneurs and businesses such as
[“This Black Entrepreneur Is Teaching Teens From Chicago How To Build Their Own Business.”](https://blackmainstreet.net/this-black-entrepreneur-is-teaching-teens-from-chicago-how-to-build-their-own-business/) Black Main Street also publishes news articles with emotionally loaded language, such as [“Trump’s 2020 Campaign Caught Using STOLEN Photos Of Black People With Photoshopped MAGA Hats”](https://blackmainstreet.net/trumps-2020-campaign-caught-using-stolen-photos-of-black-people-with-photoshopped-maga-hats/).
They also have a subsection called “Missing Person” where they exclusively publish African Americans that are missing, such as
[“UPDATED: Police Searching For Missing 3-Yr-Old Miracle Crook and 2-Yr-Old Tony Crook; Mother arrested”](https://blackmainstreet.net/police-searching-for-missing-3-yr-old-miracle-crook-and-2-yr-old-tony-crook-mother-arrested/). Finally, they frequently report on injustice, and police brutality toward African Americans [Dad Wants Cop Fired For Pointing Gun at His Toddler Son](https://blackmainstreet.net/dad-wants-cop-fired-for-pointing-gun-at-his-toddler-son/). Regarding sourcing, they generally use credible sources such as [Yahoo News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/) and factually mixed sources like [The Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-sun/).
Editorially, most stories favor the left and denigrate the right, particularly former President Donald Trump,
[“Donald Trump Says He Has A “New Deal For Black America.”](https://blackmainstreet.net/donald-trump-says-new-deal-black-america/) A quote from the article reads, “Donald Trump laid out his plan to help the Black community – in front of his usual mostly white audience. In his usual snarky demeanor, Trump painted an unrealistic picture of the entire Black community being in dire poverty and himself as the person to fix all the problems.” Generally, the news is reported mostly factually with a strong left-leaning bias in story selection and editorial positions.
