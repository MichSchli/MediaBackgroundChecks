Analysis / Bias
Newstalk ZB is a news and talk radio network in New Zealand. It is known for its conservative views on topics like climate change and utilizes moderately biased language both in headlines and articles;
[“Will this be the climate crisis event that finally spurs action?”](https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/heather-du-plessis-allan-drive/opinion/heather-du-plessis-allan-will-this-be-the-climate-crisis-event-that-finally-spurs-action/) A quote from the article reads, “Tell you what, our politicians would have a lot more support on their climate change policies if they were realistic. Quit trying to convince us to save the planet and focus on saving Auckland, the Coromandel, Gisborne, and Hawke’s Bay.” In a way, it suggests politicians should stop focusing on saving the entire planet and instead focus on saving a few regions in New Zealand. This is a viewpoint favored by the right.
Newstalk ZB’s approach to topics like immigration and minority issues utilizes strong emotional wording such as this
[“Only one immigrant applies for Government’s new investor visa,”](https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/mike-hosking-breakfast/audio/aaron-martin-immigration-lawyer-on-governments-new-investor-visa/) which can also be perceived as framing the program as unsuccessful or may lead readers to assume a lack of interest or confidence in the program.
