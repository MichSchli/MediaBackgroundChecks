History
The American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), based in Austin, Texas, presents itself as a non-profit 501(c)(3) membership organization. It claims to be dedicated to challenging racial and ethnic classifications and preferences in public policies. Their principle is rooted in the belief that an
[individual’s race](https://americanallianceforequalrights.org/about/) should neither harm nor help them in their life’s endeavors. This aligns with a civil rights perspective that emphasizes individual merit over racial or ethnic identity. The website lacks transparency as it only lists Edward Jay Blum as President, with no other information.

Analysis / Bias
Edward Blum, the President of AAER is a conservative legal strategist known for his activism
[against affirmative action](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/us/edward-blum-and-the-project-on-fair-representation-head-to-the-supreme-court-to-fight-race-based-laws.html) based on race and ethnicity. He is the director of the [Project for Fair Representation](https://projectonfairrepresentation.org/about-us/), which focuses on voting, education, contracting, employment, and racial quotas, and has been [funded by conservative trusts and foundations](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/28/donors-sffa-conservative-trusts/), including Donors Trust, the Searle Freedom Trust, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and The 85 Fund.
The American Alliance for Equal Rights advocates for the abolition of affirmative action and racial equity programs, citing them as
[discriminatory](https://www.aclu.org/news/racial-justice/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher) against whites and Asian Americans.
The website has a newsroom that currently only has two stories on it:
[Conservative activist who took down affirmative action is now going after law firms’ diversity programs](https://americanallianceforequalrights.org/conservative-activist-who-took-down-affirmative-action-is-now-going-after-law-firms-diversity-programs/), and [Republican AGs warn law firms on race-based hiring practices after Supreme Court ruling on colleges](https://americanallianceforequalrights.org/republican-ags-warn-law-firms-on-race-based-hiring-practices-after-supreme-court-ruling-on-colleges/). Both stories are properly sourced from [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), BLS.gov, and census.gov. However, the second story relies on the Questionable [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/).
AAER lists its current litigation cases on the website, such as the most recent
[American Alliance for Equal Rights Files Lawsuit Challenging Venture Capital Firm’s Race-Exclusive Policies](https://americanallianceforequalrights.org/american-alliance-for-equal-rights-files-lawsuit-challenging-venture-capital-firms-race-exclusive-policies/). The lawsuit is against the Fearless Fund, a venture capital firm focusing on women founders of color, specifically alleging discrimination in a grant program aimed at Black-women-owned small businesses. This lawsuit argues that the grant violates Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which requires private contracts to be enforced without regard to race.
The American Alliance for Equal Rights, through its lawsuit against the Fearless Fund, continues to demonstrate its opposition to affirmative action and racial equity policies. This stance, while potentially legally grounded in civil rights legislation, can be perceived as aligning with conservative viewpoints.
