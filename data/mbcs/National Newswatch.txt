Analysis / Bias
National Newswatch typically publishes news from other Canadian media outlets such as the
[Calgary Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/calgary-herald/), [CTV News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ctv-news/), and the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/). The website is balanced in left and right-leaning sources. National Newswatch also has an opinion page that publishes opinion pieces from other Canadian media outlets, and original pieces such as this [Our Sense of Patriotism Has Changed](https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2021/05/19/our-sense-of-patriotism-has-changed/#.YKmPPqhKiUk). This op-ed slightly favors the left, while many republished op-eds come from right-leaning Postmedia sources such as the [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/). In general, the bias of this website is a very slight left lean with most news reported factually.
