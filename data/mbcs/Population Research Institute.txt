History
[Founded in 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_Research_Institute), by [Paul Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Marx_(monk)), a family sociologist, a Catholic priest, and Benedictine monk, [Population Research Institute (PRI)](https://www.pop.org/simple/who-we-are/) is a “non-profit research group whose goals are to expose the myth of overpopulation as well as “human rights abuses committed in population control programs, and to make the case that people are the world’s greatest resource.” Essentially, the primary function of the group is to operate programs against the advancement of contraception, sterilization, and abortion. They further claim their “global network of pro-life groups spans over 30 countries.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Population Research Institute is a Catholic advocacy group that promotes banning abortion and contraception. The views expressed align with the Christian right and often are at odds with science. The website publishes in-depth reports such as this:
[Innocents Betrayed: A side of family planning the White House does not discuss](https://www.pop.org/innocents-betrayed-a-side-of-family-planning-the-white-house-does-not-discuss/). They also publish a weekly briefing that features loaded emotional wording such as this: [Population control policies to combat climate change prove deadly, demographer says](https://www.pop.org/population-control-policies-to-combat-climate-change-prove-deadly-demographer-says/). This story relies on the Questionable [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) as its primary source. Further, they sometimes republish news from other poor sources such as [LifeSiteNews,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/) which holds extreme right views such as this: [Transgender people are suffering, and indulging their delusions will not help them](https://www.pop.org/transgender-people-are-suffering-and-indulging-their-delusions-will-not-help-them/) as well as anti-LGBTQ messages, [How to Defeat the Enemies of Natural Marriage](https://www.pop.org/how-to-defeat-the-enemies-of-natural-marriage/).
When it comes to science, they have published unproven information such as this:
[Out of India Comes Yet More Evidence that Abortion Causes Breast Cancer](https://www.pop.org/out-of-india-comes-yet-more-evidence-that-abortion-causes-breast-cancer/). According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html) the consensus of studies indicates that “induced abortion is not linked to an increase in breast cancer risk.” Further, they frequently do not align with the consensus of science regarding human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/): [Climate Change Alarmism Results in Anti-Baby Madness](https://www.pop.org/climate-change-alarmism-results-in-anti-baby-madness/).
PRI has also faced criticism from some groups, such as the
[Ten Million Club](https://www.overpopulationawareness.org/en/about-us/the-foundation), which states they have a “religious hidden agenda (against family planning and contraception) that motivates its deceiving claims, stating that those are not backed up by any original research as PRI has never been published in a single peer-review paper in any scientific journal.” Finally, the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) has called the Population Research Institute “ [an anti-choice and anti-LGBT organization](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/09/22/hate-group-world-congress-families-co-sponsors-conference-nairobi).”
