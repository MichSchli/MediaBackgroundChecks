Analysis / Bias
In review, Liberal America utilizes strong emotional wording that favors the left in headlines like this:
[Trump Just Left The Kurds to Die. The Question is: For What? (Video).](http://liberalamerica.life/2018/12/23/tm-trump-just-left-the-kurds-to-die-the-question-is-for-what-video/) This story comes straight from Op-Ed News which we rate Left Biased and Mixed for factual reporting. Another loaded headline reads: [Trump’s Really, Really Bad Week As The Walls Close In (Video)](http://liberalamerica.life/2018/12/01/tm-trumps-really-really-bad-week-as-the-walls-close-in/). This article is very well sourced from various credible sources such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), [Chicago Sun-Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/chicago-sun-times/), and [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). Within the article, there is significant use of emotional language to sway the reader, such as this: “We now know apparently the price Trump was willing to pay to betray his country”. Some articles such as [this one,](http://liberalamerica.life/2018/03/23/rachel-maddow-koch-brothers-response-script/) is not sourced via hyperlink at all.
In general, all stories on Liberal America favor the left and denigrate the right.
