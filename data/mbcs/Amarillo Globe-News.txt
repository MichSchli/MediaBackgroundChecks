Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered through journalists with neutral wording such as this:
[Texas Tech system officials promote legislative agenda in Austin](https://www.amarillo.com/news/20190305/texas-tech-system-officials-promote-legislative-agenda-in-austin/1). National and World are derived from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). All information is appropriately sourced. The Globe News has a history of mainly endorsing [Republican candidates](https://www.amarillo.com/opinion/editorial/2018-02-19/agn-endorsement-seliger-best-amarillo-area); however, their op-ed page is mostly balanced in presenting both views.
