Analysis
The
[Joerogan.com](https://www.joerogan.com/) website publishes information about Joe Rogan and links to his Spotify podcast; therefore, this review will focus on statements he has made on the podcast as well as in interviews.
The Joe Rogan Experience interviews a wide variety of people, from entertainers to athletes to political figures. Joe Rogan is unique in his interview style as he will challenge and debate guests on some issues. He doesn’t simply ask questions and wait for an answer, which is probably why his podcast is so popular. Through these interviews, Rogan’s political views are exposed.
Joe Rogan
[describes himself](https://heavy.com/news/joe-rogan/politics-socially-liberal/) as “socially liberal.” In January 2020, he said, “I’ve been liberal my whole life.” He also indicates that he does not identify with either the right or left but holds a wide range of views. For example, [he states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdFMBSPxfMw&t=2187s&ab_channel=TheDailyWire) that he supports same-sex marriage, gay rights, women’s rights, recreational drug use, universal health care, and universal basic income. However, he also holds right-leaning positions such as gun rights and the Second Amendment, criticism of cancel culture and believing right-wing media is suppressed. Further, he advocates libertarian viewpoints such as limiting foreign military intervention.
Bias
In 2020, Joe Rogan supported Tulsi Gabbard and then endorsed and voted for
[Bernie Sanders](https://heavy.com/news/joe-rogan/politics-socially-liberal/) in the Democratic Primaries stating that he admired his consistency. However, when Sanders was eliminated in favor of Joe Biden, he threatened to vote for Trump, citing Biden’s “mental decline.” In the end, he voted for the libertarian candidate as he did in both 2012 and 2016.
Rogan had faced controversy when the progressive activist organization
[MoveOn.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/move-on/) [accused him](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/479917-moveon-calls-on-sanders-to-renounce-joe-rogan-endorsement) of being “someone known for promoting transphobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, racism, and misogyny.” He has also stated that [trans women](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/24/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-rogan-endorsement/index.html) should not be competing in MMA matches, which aligns with Tulsi Gabbard’s position. Finally, in 2020-2021 Rogan promoted misleading and false information regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. See failed fact checks below.
In general, Joe Rogan holds a wide range of political views that don’t easily align with either major political party. Although he has consistently voted libertarian, the majority of his views align more closely with the left on social issues. When it comes to factual reporting, he sometimes promotes misinformation, especially regarding covid-19 and vaccines. Finally, he has promoted unproven conspiracy theories around the
[ January 6th riots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwYIWno8EJo&ab_channel=CharlieKirk) that align with the right.
