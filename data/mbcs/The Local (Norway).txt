Analysis / Bias
In review, The Local Norway publishes news on Norway with minimal bias such as this
[Norwegian flag taken down in US town after being confused for Confederate banner](https://www.thelocal.no/20200731/norwegian-flag-taken-down-in-us-town-after-being-confused-for-confederate-banner). This story is properly sourced to the [Lansing Journal.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lansing-state-journal/) Many stories involve tourism to Norway, such as this [Foreigners in Norway plan summer ‘staycation’: Survey](https://www.thelocal.no/20200702/foreigners-in-norway-plan-summer-staycation-survey).
From an editorial perspective, there is a slight lean to the left:
[Blow to Norwegian environmentalists as lawsuit over Arctic oil defeated](https://www.thelocal.no/20200123/blow-to-norwegian-environmentalists-as-lawsuit-over-arctic-oil-defeated). In general, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias.
