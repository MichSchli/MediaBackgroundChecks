Analysis / Bias
The Financial Express covers economic, financial, and general news in review with moderately loaded language. After
[ Ashok Gehlot’s outburst is it the end of road for Sachin Pilot in Congress?](https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/after-ashok-gehlots-outburst-is-it-the-end-of-road-for-sachin-pilot-in-congress/2029987/). This story, like many, comes from the Indian News Wire Press Trust of India (PTI). Other stories are published by reporters such as this [IAF to get lethal Rafales: Laden with weapons, Air Force gets ready to receive Rafale fighters](https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/iaf-to-get-lethal-rafales-laden-with-weapons-air-force-gets-ready-to-receive-rafale-fighters/2029562/) but does not contain hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, the Financial Express favors conservative Prime Minister Modi and rarely offers criticism such as this:
[PM Modi interacts with IBM CEO Arvind Krishna; IBM says has big investment plan for India](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/pm-modi-interacts-with-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-ibm-says-has-big-investment-plan-for-india/2029893/), and this [PM Modi crosses another milestone! Goes past six crore follower-count on Twitter](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/pm-modi-crosses-another-milestone-goes-past-6-crore-follower-count-on-twitter/2028677/). They generally rely on the Associated Press and PTI when reporting on USA politics. In general, they hold a right-leaning editorial bias favoring Modi’s BJP government and do not always report factual news as evidenced by failed fact checks.
