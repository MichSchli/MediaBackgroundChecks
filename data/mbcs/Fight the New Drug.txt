Analysis / Bias
Fight the New Drug publishes articles that discuss the harmful effects of pornography, often citing scientific studies to support their claims. However, their interpretation of these studies aligns predominantly with their agenda, making the factual reporting mixed. For example, articles like
[“How Porn Can Change the Brain”](https://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-can-change-the-brain/) and [“Why Porn Can Be Difficult to Quit”](https://fightthenewdrug.org/why-porn-can-be-difficult-to-quit/) cite scientific studies but frame them in a way that supports their viewpoint without considering contradictory evidence or [perspectives.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-sex/201601/evidence-mounts-more-porn-less-sexual-assault)
In contrast, the
[American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/pornography) highlights that the scientific community is still divided on whether pornography has drug-like effects on the brain or is inherently harmful. [The APA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-psychological-association-apa/) article presents multiple perspectives and emphasizes the need for more research, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior. This multi-faceted approach is absent in Fight the New Drug’s content, which tends to portray pornography as inherently harmful without offering a balanced perspective.
The organization claims to be non-religious, but its
[financial backing](https://www.deseret.com/2011/11/13/20230657/fighting-pornography-group-warns-about-dangers-of-new-drug) includes organizations with religious affiliations, such as [The Ashton Family Foundation](https://fconline.foundationcenter.org/fdo-grantmaker-profile?key=ASHT007), [Boyer Company](https://www.boyercompany.com/jake-boyer/), and [Rucks Family Foundation](https://cspotlight.com/mission-of-hope/), which could indicate a religious bias.
