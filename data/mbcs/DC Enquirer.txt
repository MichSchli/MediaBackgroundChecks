Analysis / Bias
The DC Enquirer usually summarizes news stories from other sources and publishes them on numerous social media pages. According to the left-leaning
[Popular Info](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/popular-information/) website, within 36 days of launch, the DC Enquirer was [more popular](https://popular.info/p/a-far-right-website-created-36-days?utm_source=url) than the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) on Facebook. The article continues; within seconds, the news stories are published to Right-leaning conservative Facebook pages such as Save America, Red Wave, Impeach Joe Biden, I love America, Keep Texas Red and Conservative Americans. The article goes on to explain:
“All of this is supposed to be against the rules. Facebook prohibits “
[coordinated inauthentic behavior](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/),” which it defines as when “groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they are doing.” This appears to be exactly what the network propping up the DC Enquirer is doing.”
Articles and headlines are highly emotional that appear designed to anger conservatives to induce article sharing, such as this
[Former CIA Director Shares Off-The-Wall Tweet From Left-Wing Pundit, Suggesting TRUMP MIGHT FACE EXECUTION For Possessing Nuclear Related Docs At Mar-A-Lago](https://dcenquirer.com/trump-raid-fbi-cia-secrets-nuclear-execution/). All articles reviewed favor the right and usually denigrate the left with headlines such as this [HUNTER BIDEN’S ‘Laptop from Hell’ Repairman BLASTS CORRUPT FBI For Blatant Hypocrisy And Double Standard, After Raid On Trump’s Mar-A-Lago Home](https://dcenquirer.com/laptop-from-hell-repairman-points-out-fbi-hypocrisy-trump-raid/).
Articles rely on a mix of sources from left to the right, with most aligning with the right such as the
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), and the Questionable [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). While we could not find any instances of failed fact checks, they sometimes rely on sources with poor track records from fact-checkers. Further, the website is consistently one-sided in promoting right-wing propaganda favoring former President Trump.
