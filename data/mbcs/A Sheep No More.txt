Analysis / Bias
In review, A Sheep No More publishes completely insane conspiracy stories that seem like satire. Topics range from the
[New World Order](http://asheepnomore.net/category/new-world-order-nwo/), [Pseudoscience](http://asheepnomore.net/2018/06/16/study-fasting-for-three-days-can-regenerate-the-entire-immune-system-of-humans/) and [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/). Sourcing for information typically comes from other conspiracy websites such as [Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). This is one of those websites that has to be seen to get the full effect of the tin foil hat.
