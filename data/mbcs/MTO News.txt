Analysis / Bias
MTO News covers news about African Americans and celebrity news. Most articles originate from other sources such as
[TMZ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tmz/) and the [Hollywood Reporter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hollywood-reporter/). They also conduct original reporting that usually features celebrity gossip or rumors sourced from social media or sometimes not at all.
Editorially, more stories favor the left, such as this
[Trump Without His Wig](https://mtonews.com/entertainment-news/trump-without-his-wig); featuring a doctored video. Although more stories favor the left, MTO does not discriminate if a story is shocking or sensational. Further, MTO News routinely publishes unsubstantiated or outright false claims, as seen below in Failed Fact Checks. Finally, during the covid-19 pandemic, they frequently published misinformation such as DMX dying from a heart attack after taking the vaccine. There is [no evidence](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/12/instagram-posts/fact-checking-unproven-claims-rapper-dmx-died-afte/) that he had gotten the vaccine as statements from his family and the hospital did not mention a COVID-19 vaccine.
In general, MTO News frequently publishes unsourced gossip and makes false claims without evidence. They also hold a left-leaning political bias when covering conservatives.
