History
[Founded in October 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/thesorrentino.com), The Sorrentino is a news and opinion blog with the tagline “News, Opinion, Liberty, and Freedom”, which is founded and run by Nick Sorrentino. According to their [about page](https://www.thesorrentino.com/about) The Sorrentino covers “economics, to foreign policy, to pop culture, to domestic politics, everything is in play.” The about page further states “Born out of our work at [Against Crony Capitalism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/against-crony-capitialism/) and AC2News.com THE SORRENTINO seeks to apply the same rigor and spirit on a broader scale.”
Nick Sorrentino is the Co-Founder and editor of Against Crony Capitalism.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Sorrentino’s format is very similar to Against Crony Capitalism in that they publish a snippet of a news article, and then offer opinions based on the content. They then link to the original article. In general, they choose mainstream sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), and the [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/). Headlines and wording use moderately loaded language that favors the right such as: [The New Deal was a massive mistake for the USA. A “green” New Deal is just more cronyism](https://www.thesorrentino.com/all-news/the-new-deal-was-a-massive-mistake-for-the-usa-a-green-new-deal-is-just-more-cronyism) and [More Shutdown Awesomeness: Hundreds of TSA screeners calling out sick (The “blue flu”).](https://www.thesorrentino.com/all-news/more-shutdown-awesomeness-first-on-cnn-hundreds-of-tsa-screeners-calling-out-sick) We have also found very strong loaded words within articles such as this quote: “De Blasio may be a socialist/commie but he’s also a crony capitalist. (Which is the way it always works with socialist jefe types.)” Further, this article is linked to the Conspiracy website [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), which has a horrible track record with fact-checkers.
Editorially, they do not distinguish between opinion pieces and straight news, however, this is essentially an opinion website that favors libertarian policy and generally limited government intervention. Although The Sorrentino is strong to the right when it comes to economic issues, they are left of center on social issues, such as this:
[Kentucky GOP lawmaker, pushing for pot legalization, says he smoked a joint while battling cancer.](https://www.thesorrentino.com/all-news/kentucky-gop-lawmaker-pushing-for-marijuana-legalization-says-he-smoked-a-joint-while-battling-can) In this article, the author opines, “We are for cannabis legalization for a myriad of reasons. First, the war on pot is deeply crony. Illegal pot is good for entrenched law enforcement agencies, the drug dealers who can charge above-market prices under a prohibition regime, and Pharma which would like to keep selling Americans highly profitable pain (and other) meds. (Instead of pot.)”
In general, story selection favors free-market capitalism and limited government (Right), while promoting social liberty (Left).
