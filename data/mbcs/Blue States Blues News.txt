[Democrats got control of one city in this red state—and what happened next is truly horrifying](https://bluestatebluesnews.com/democrats-got-control-of-one-city-in-this-red-state-and-what-happened-next-is-truly-horrifying/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on the information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Abbott Press Secretary goes off after D.C.’s Mayor hit the panic button over the Lone Star State giving leftists a taste of their own medicine](https://bluestatebluesnews.com/abbott-press-secretary-goes-off-after-d-c-s-mayor-hit-the-panic-button-over-the-lone-star-state-giving-leftists-a-taste-of-their-own-medicine/), and [Gavin Newsom targeted women with this sick crusade – and what he wants them to do will turn your stomach](https://bluestatebluesnews.com/gavin-newsom-targeted-women-with-this-sick-crusade-and-what-he-wants-them-to-do-will-turn-your-stomach/).
