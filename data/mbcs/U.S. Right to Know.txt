Analysis / Bias
The U.S. Right To Know (USRTK) organization aims to expose perceived unethical practices in the food and agriculture sectors. It engages in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests targeting scientists and academics and publishes critical profiles of various trade and advocacy groups. USRTK has faced criticism for its tactics, which some view as harassment and intimidation of scientists. The group’s primary funder is the Organic Consumers Association, which is aligned with Joseph Mercola, known for promoting pseudoscience and anti-vaccine views.
[Critics](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/glp-facts/u-s-right-to-know-usrtk-organic-industry-funded-anti-bio-group-attacks-researchers/) argue that USRTK is part of a network of ‘science rejectionists’ and question the legitimacy of its campaigns.
In general, the USRTK presents information with a veneer of credibility but has associations with anti-vaccination activists such as
[Robert F. Kennedy Jr](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/)., [Joseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/), and the [Organic Consumers Association](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/organic-consumers-association/), which funds them. While there are no failed fact checks, they associate with individuals and groups who promote anti-scientific views and hence, routinely promote misinformation.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years. However, the funders and activists they support routinely fail fact-checks and promote misinformation.
