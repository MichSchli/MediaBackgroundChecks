Funded by / Ownership
[Olympic Media](https://www.olympicmedia.com/) owns and publishes American Wire News. According to [Open Secrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), Olympic Media [receives funding](https://www.opensecrets.org/campaign-expenditures/vendor?year=2022&vendor=Olympic%20Media) from prominent Republican politicians and PACS. For example, in the 2022 election cycle, they received a total of $4,831,681. Notable funders include Jim Jordan for Congress $1,293,441, [Great American Patriot Project](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/great-american-patriot-project/C00767608/expenditures/2022#vendors) $1,102,481, Cawthorn for North Carolina $488,408, and Josh Hawley for Senate $244,084.
The American Wire News website lacks transparency as they do not disclose these funders. Advertising, donations, and a store that sells conservative branded merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
American Wire publishes conservative commentary, news stories, and a daily newsletter for subscribers. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded language such as this
[Father desperately tries to stop pediatrician wife from chemically castrating 9-yr-old son, Cali law is against him](https://americanwirenews.com/father-desperately-tries-to-stop-pediatrician-wife-from-chemically-castrating-9-yr-old-son-cali-law-is-against-him/), and [Catfight! MTG delivers smackdown of dramatic AOC when the two go rounds on Twitter](https://americanwirenews.com/catfight-mtg-delivers-smackdown-of-dramatic-aoc-when-the-two-go-rounds-on-twitter/).
Regarding sourcing, American Wire typically relies on credible sources like
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). They also republish articles from the factually Mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and link to [BizPac Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bizpac-review/) articles and social media posts. We have also found evidence of them [referencing](https://americanwirenews.com/lara-logan-doubles-down-in-battle-with-auschwitz-museum-over-the-evil-of-dr-fauci/) the discredited [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Editorially, story selection and opinion pieces exclusively favor the right, such as this
[‘We’re ashamed of nothing’: Matt Gaetz breaks Dem hype to ‘expose the truth’ about Jan 6th](https://americanwirenews.com/were-ashamed-of-nothing-matt-gaetz-breaks-dem-hype-to-expose-the-truth-about-jan-6th/). Articles frequently denigrate Democrats, such as this [Pelosi mocked for botching final speech as House Speaker: ‘Happy Shwanza to all and to all a good night!’](https://americanwirenews.com/pelosi-mocked-for-botching-final-speech-as-house-speaker-happy-shwanza-to-all-and-to-all-a-good-night/) Further, articles often [promote politicians](https://americanwirenews.com/?s=hawley) who have funded Olympic Media.
When reporting on scientific issues such as Covid-19 vaccines, they generally report factually. Still, they tend to highlight the negatives of the vaccine, such as this
[Study reveals myocarditis risk up to 3 times higher with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine than with Pfizer](https://americanwirenews.com/study-reveals-myocarditis-risk-up-to-3-times-higher-with-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-than-with-pfizer/). Regarding the “stolen 2020 election” conspiracy theory, they do not directly endorse that the election was stolen; however, they report the claims of others, such as this [Trump claps back at Chris Christie for calling on GOP to move beyond 2020 election](https://americanwirenews.com/trump-claps-back-at-chris-christie-for-calling-on-gop-to-move-beyond-2020-election/). In general, American Wire News is a conservative propaganda website based on promoting paying Republican politicians and consistent one-sided reporting that favor the right.
