Funded by / Ownership
The Objectivist does not disclose ownership; however, according to
[Newsguard](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/objectivist.co?cid=04dab292-85f2-47b6-b18c-097b097f9da8), they may be owned by [Kristin Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Tate), a libertarian writer for [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/). We cannot verify whether she is involved with this website or not. Revenue is derived through advertising and sponsored content.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Objectivist publishes some original content; however, most is republished from other sources such as the strongly right-leaning
[Lifezette](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lifezette/) and the Questionable [Wayne Dupree](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/waynedupree-com/). Both Lifezette and Wayne Dupree have failed numerous fact checks. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording such as this [Bombshell:](https://www.objectivist.co/2020/04/bombshell-u-s-intel-says-obama-gave-millions-of-dollars-to-wuhan-lab-that-produced-coronavirus/) [U.S. Intel says Obama gave millions of dollars to Wuhan lab that produced coronavirus](https://www.objectivist.co/2020/04/bombshell-u-s-intel-says-obama-gave-millions-of-dollars-to-wuhan-lab-that-produced-coronavirus/). This claim is not valid, [according](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/facebook-post-repeats-flawed-claim-on-wuhan-lab-funding/) to [factcheck.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/factcheck/). In general, story selection always favors the right and is not factual.
