History
[The Washington Post](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/caseconsortium/casestudies/147/casestudy/www/layout/case_id_147_id_1014.html) (WaPo), headquartered in Washington, D.C., was founded in 1877 by [Stilson Hutchins.](https://globegazette.com/mcpress/news/local/early-osage-newspaper-pioneer-founded-washington-post/article_3ba16a32-bd72-5bda-b9f3-1fc2b9ea7bd2.html) He was a journalist, publisher, and passionate Democrat who later became a Missouri state representative for the Democratic Party and operated The Post until 1889. Republican financier Eugene Meyer bought [The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post) in 1946. After Meyer stepped down to become head of the Federal Reserve, his son-in-law, Philip Graham, became publisher.
In 1947, after Philip Graham committed suicide, his wife, Katharine Meyer Graham, took over the Washington Post Company. She was the first female publisher of a major American newspaper. Her son, Donald Graham, became a publisher in 1979. Donald Graham was the chairman of The Post before selling it to

According to a NY Magazine [article](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/political-leanings-of-silicon-valley.html), “Bezos is libertarian who has given money to anti-tax initiatives in the past” and supports gay marriage through donations. Bezos also [donated](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/the-politics-of-new-i-washington-post-i-owner-jeff-bezos/278385/) to both Democratic and Republican Senators, respectively.
Analysis
The Washington Post played a part with The
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) in publishing excerpts of the [Pentagon Papers](http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/caseconsortium/casestudies/147/casestudy/www/layout/case_id_147_id_1014.html) in 1971. The original papers can be viewed [here](https://www.archives.gov/research/pentagon-papers). The WaPo started reporting on [Watergate](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/exhibits/watergate_files/content.php?section=1&page=d) in 1972, linking the DNC break-in to Nixon’s campaign and eventually bringing down the administration of President Richard Nixon.
According to
[Pew Research](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/pj_14-10-21_mediapolarization-01/), the Washington Post is [more trusted by](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/pj_14-10-21_mediapolarization-01/) liberal readers than conservatives. However, in 2016, The Washington Post published an anti-Bernie Sanders editorial, “ [Bernie Sanders’s fiction-filled campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bernie-sanderss-fiction-filled-campaign/2016/01/27/cd1b2866-c478-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1a38866f5b69),” that the [New Republic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-republic/) called an “ [embarrassment](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/128558/washington-post-editorial-boards-attack-bernie-sanders-embarrassment).” Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) Institute survey found that 43% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-states) and 32% do not, ranking them #8 in trust of the major USA news providers.
The WaPo was involved in a scandal in 1980 when they published an article by
[Janet Cooke](http://www.dw.com/en/marking-history-the-pulitzer-prize/a-43400313) that won the Pulitzer Prize. Cooke later returned the Pulitzer Prize when it turned out the story was not true.
Bias
In review, The Washington Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Trump escalates China trade war, announces plan for tariffs on $200 billion in products”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-escalates-china-trade-war-announces-plan-for-tariffs-on-200-billion-in-products/2018/06/18/ac683f80-7355-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html?utm_term=.936e6ba72b56) and editorials [“The Trump administration created this awful border policy. It doesn’t need Congress to fix it.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-created-this-awful-border-policy-it-doesnt-need-congress-to-fix-it/2018/06/18/5ede36dc-7334-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9a02e24e7020) They typically utilize credible sources such as [Propublica.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), [Associated Press,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) [Slate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/slate/), Princeton.edu, [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [wired.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/), and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) when it comes to sourcing.
Story selection and editorials tend to favor the left, with the Washington Post only
[endorsing Democratic Presidential candidates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/patrick-pexton-the-posts-endorsements-historically-tend-democratic/2012/11/02/6890a49a-250a-11e2-ba29-238a6ac36a08_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.492494072f5e) since 1976, including Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. The Washington Post has also been accused of having an [anti-progressive bias,](https://gritpost.com/jeff-bezos-washington-post-sanders/?fbclid=IwAR3KUPZc9PxSitfjBAMnyT2xU1IBo_z2Q2WEMzRltNfrU17ZvJ-guee0fTM) with numerous op-eds negative toward Bernie Sanders.
On 3/16/2021, the Washington Post amended and corrected a story from a December 23, 2020, phone call. On this call, they claimed an anonymous source told them that former President Trump told election investigator Frances Watson to “find the fraud” and that she would be a “National Hero.” In the original article, the Washington Post used quotes to indicate these are the words of the former President.
[According](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-something-dying-in-darkness-at-the-washington-post-11615926067) to the actual recording received by the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), those words were never said. In general, the WaPo reports news mostly factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias. While still a highly credible source, there needs to be a level of caution when they utilize anonymous sources.
