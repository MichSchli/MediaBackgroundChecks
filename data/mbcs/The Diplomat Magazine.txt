Analysis / Bias
In review, Diplomat Magazine publishes news related to politics, society, and culture within the Asia-Pacific Region. Many stories are related to foreign relations and most often are low in bias, such as this
[Saudi-Pakistani Relations Enter Tough Times as Both Riyadh and Islamabad Face Challenges](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/saudi-pakistani-relations-enter-tough-times-as-both-riyadh-and-islamabad-face-challenges/). The Diplomat thoroughly sources all information through hyperlinks. For example, the previous story links to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), as well as many other credible sources.
The website does not have a dedicated area for opinion pieces. Still, they do cover politics with minimal bias, such as this
[South Koreans Flock to Study Japan Amid Ongoing Tensions](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/south-koreans-flock-to-study-japan-amid-ongoing-tension-between-two/). Regarding USA politics, they tend to report negatively on the former Trump administration, but only as it relates to Asian-Pacific affairs such as this: [Assessing Trump’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, 2 Years In](https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/assessing-trumps-indo-pacific-strategy-2-years-in/). This story does use loaded words, as exemplified by this quote: “However, by some measures, the United States has become increasingly unhinged from its Asian partners of late.” In general, news reporting is factual and low biased, while occasionally, the authors use loaded emotional language that is opposed to the Trump administration. This is rare.
