[Founded in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Civil_Beat) by [Pierre Omidyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Omidyar), the founder of eBay, Honolulu Civil Beat is an investigative news website that practices watchdog journalism related to the U.S. state of Hawaii. The current executive editor is Patti Epler.
According to their

Analysis / Bias
In review, Honolulu Civil Beat publishes original watchdog investigative journalism covering education, politics, and environmental issues. They also
[provide a database](https://www.civilbeat.org/data/) of information related to Police Misconduct, Public Employee Salaries, and Financial disclosures. Original content typically uses minimal to moderate loaded language such as this: [Most UH Students Are People Of Color But Their Teachers Are Mainly White](https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/10/most-uh-students-are-people-of-color-but-their-teachers-are-mainly-white/). This story is appropriately sourced to [Brookings Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/) and the University of Hawaii. Many original articles focus on the environment, such as this: [Maui’s Water Fight Has Become A Major Power Struggle](https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/10/mauis-water-fight-has-become-a-major-power-struggle/) and climate change [Hawaii 2040: Climate Change Is Already Here. And We’re Running Out Of Time](https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/01/hawaii-2040-climate-change-is-already-here-and-were-running-out-of-time/). Again, both of these reports are properly sourced.
Politically and editorially, most commentary leans progressive with support for fighting
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), protecting the environment, [education](https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/06/aclu-says-hawaii-schools-are-suspending-too-many-students/), and [gun control](https://www.civilbeat.org/2017/10/congress-must-get-off-its-ass-and-move-to-stop-gun-violence/). Further, there is frequent negative reporting on the Trump Administration: [There’s A Wider Scandal Suggested By The Trump Investigations](https://www.civilbeat.org/2019/01/theres-a-wider-scandal-suggested-by-the-trump-investigations/).
The Honolulu Civil Beat also republishes news from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Generally, news reporting is in-depth and factual, with moderate left-leaning bias in story selection and editorial commentaries.
