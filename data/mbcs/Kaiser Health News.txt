Analysis / Bias
Kaiser Health News covers news and information related to the healthcare system and health policy. Articles and headlines often contain moderately loaded language that favors the left, such as this,
[Rural Communities Left Hurting Without a Hospital, Ambulance, or Doctors Nearby](https://khn.org/news/article/rural-communities-left-hurting-without-a-hospital-ambulance-or-doctors-nearby/). Although the wording is sometimes biased, they rely on credible sources such as [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/), [Scientific American](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/scientific-american/), and peer-reviewed journals. Further, they work with the IFCN fact-checker [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/) to provide healthcare-related fact checks. Finally, during the Covid-19 pandemic, they have provided dedicated sections to coronavirus and vaccines from a pro-science evidence-based perspective.
Editorially, they moderately align with the left by promoting universal healthcare, and a focus on health equity such as this
[Data Science Proved What Pittsburgh’s Black Leaders Knew: Racial Disparities Compound Covid Risk](https://khn.org/news/article/data-science-proved-what-pittsburghs-black-leaders-knew-racial-disparities-compound-covid-risk/). Kaiser Health News is a reliable source for factual healthcare information but leans left in story selection and editorial direction.
