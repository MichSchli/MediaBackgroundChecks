Funded by / Ownership
The Ottawa Sun is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc. which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc. joined the Postmedia board, and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018, due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a
[downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod, as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016, while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Ottawa Sun covers local news through the use of journalists and with minimal bias, such as this:
[Ottawa man, 20, charged in Mar. 9 Dynes Road stabbing](https://ottawasun.com/news/local-news/ottawa-man-20-charged-in-dynes-road-stabbing/wcm/4a38e334-002d-4754-b717-8deaadc8b178). National and World news is usually republished from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and occasionally the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), among other credible sources. Editorially, the Ottawa Sun [favors conservatives](https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/prentice-enough-with-the-left-wing-bias-ottawa-citizen) with articles negative toward Justin Trudeau such as this: [KINSELLA: Trudeau has made a bad situation even worse](https://ottawasun.com/opinion/columnists/kinsella-trudeau-has-made-a-bad-situation-even-worse/wcm/0727040b-5a12-4589-ad21-25b81285eea8). In general, straight news reporting is low biased with a slight rightward lean in story selection; however, editorially, there is a moderate right-wing bias.
