Analysis / Bias
Arirang programming focuses more on news, current affairs, documentaries, and cultural programming and mainly caters to overseas audiences.
When reporting national news, Arirang tends to report different angles and generally uses neutral wording in their headlines. For example, when reporting covid-19 news, they report
[The President’s announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5PaB7aNTg&ab_channel=ArirangNews) “The announcement from President Moon Jae-in yesterday also pointed out that the country should be able to achieve herd immunity earlier than anticipated.“ They also report announcements from experts [“Infectious disease expert casts doubt on S. Korea’s goal of 70% herd immunity by November.“](http://www.arirang.com/news/News_View.asp?nseq=276390) Further, Arirang covers political national news with neutral wording. For example, regarding the new mayor of Seoul (The new mayor of Seoul is from the conservative opposition People Power Party (PPP). See the mayoral election details [here](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/08/985268005/south-koreas-opposition-wins-in-local-races-spelling-trouble-for-presidents-part)), they use neutral headlines such as [”New Seoul mayor Oh Se-hoon starts his first day in office,”](https://www.arirang.com/News/News_View.asp?nseq=275103) and [“S. Korea’s main opposition PPP defeats ruling DP in Seoul, Busan mayoral races.”](http://www.arirang.com/News/News_View.asp?nSeq=275076)
When reporting stories about the USA, there is neutral wording such as this:
[ “Moon, Biden agree to cooperate on N. Korea issue.”](http://www.arirang.com/news/News_View.asp?nseq=271919) A quote from the article reads, “The fact that Biden agrees on the need for cooperation raises expectations that talks could gain fresh momentum under the new U.S. administration.”
Arirang rarely provides links to their sources as they are directly reported by journalists, making it difficult to verify the context and accuracy of stories. However, since they have never failed a fact check, we rate them High for factual reporting.
