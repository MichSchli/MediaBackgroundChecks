Analysis / Bias
In review, Bustatroll.org clearly displays they are a satire website in their logo, which is displayed on every page. In general, this is a satire website that pokes fun at conservatives who believe these stories. Further, the website again displays on their
[about page](https://bustatroll.org/about-us/) that they are satire: “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie, and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental, and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you’re still having an issue with that satire thing.” In general, stories are designed to trick conservatives into sharing on social media such as this: [Kamala Harris:’After We Impeach, We Round Up The Trump Supporters’](https://bustatroll.org/2019/08/07/kamala-harrisafter-we-impeach-we-round-up-the-trump-supporters/).
Although this site and all of Christopher Blair’s properties disclaim they are satire, they are still frequently fact-checked by fact-checkers.
