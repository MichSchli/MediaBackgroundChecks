Funded by / Ownership
Al Jazeera is owned and funded by the state of Qatar. The founder and Chairman of the Board is
[Sheikh Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani,](https://network.aljazeera.com/about-us/leadership) a member of Qatar’s ruling family, the House of Thani. According to a [Fortune ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fortune-magazine/) [article,](http://fortune.com/2016/03/27/al-jazeera/) in 2016, state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera laid off 500 workers due to Qatar’s financial troubles resulting from low global prices for oil and natural gas. Al Jazeera generates revenue through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Al Jazeera reports news with minimally loaded wording in their headlines and articles such as this:
[UN approves team to monitor ceasefire in Yemen’s port city](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/approves-team-monitor-ceasefire-yemen-port-city-181221194529536.html), and [Erdogan delays Syria operation, welcomes US troop withdrawal](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/erdogan-delays-syria-operation-welcomes-troop-withdrawal-181221141412573.html). Both of these articles are properly sourced from credible news agencies. When reporting USA news, there is minimal bias in reporting such as this: [Pentagon chief Mattis quits, cites policy differences with Trump](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/defense-secretary-mattis-retire-trump-181220222749926.html). In general, straight news reporting has a minimal bias; however, as a state-funded news agency, Al Jazeera is typically [not critical of Qatar.](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/30/al-jazeera-independence-questioned-qatar)
Al Jazeera also has an opinion page that exhibits significant bias against Israel. In this
[article](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/proven-israel-thriving-war-business-europe-181219131852124.html), the author uses highly negative emotional words as evidenced by this quote: “Europe is increasingly sharing Israel’s racist approach to border security and adopting its deadly technologies.” This article, however, is properly sourced from credible media outlets. Another article, “ [How many more ways can Israel sentence Palestinians to death?”](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/ways-israel-sentence-palestinians-death-181217105304720.html) also uses loaded language that is negative toward Israel. Further, the opinion page does not favor US President Donald Trump through this article: [‘Barbed wire-plus‘: Borders know no love](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/wire-borders-love-181217135258848.html). In general, opinion pieces are routinely biased against Israel and right-wing ideologies.
In 2017, Al Jazeera aired an investigative report of Britain’s Israel lobby. Following the airing, Ofcom (the UK government-approved regulatory and competition authority) received complaints from many pro-Israeli British activists, including one former Israeli embassy employee. They were accused of anti-Semitism, bias, unfair editing, and infringement of privacy, which was later cleared by
[Ofcom](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/09/ofcom-clears-al-jazeera-ntisemitism-expose-israeli-embassy-official), who said the piece was not anti-semitic and was, in fact, investigative journalism. Later, a US version of the documentary called “Lobby” was not aired due to pressure from [US Legislators](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/05/al-jazeera-press-foreign-agent-437072) pushing for Al Jazeera to register as a foreign entity and therefore labeling its journalists as [‘spies](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/al-jazeera-investigation-us-israel-lobbying-not-published-why-qatar-a8257191.html).’ Further, [Saudi Arabia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-un-idUSKBN19L18Z) and three other Arab nations demanded Qatar to shut down Al-Jazeera. Al Jazeera rebuts the accusations [here. ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/al-jazeera-pushes-foreign-agent-accusations-180308203736149.html)
