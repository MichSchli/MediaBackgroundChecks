History
Human Progress is a part of the
[Cato Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/), which is an interactive data web project that catalogs increases in prosperity driven by the free market. Human Progress attempts to show how capitalism and free markets have led to progress for humanity. According to their [about page](https://humanprogress.org/about), they state, “Whereas we think that policies and institutions compatible with freedom and openness are important factors in promoting human well-being, we let the evidence speak for itself.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Human Progress collects data and evidence intending to show how much progress humanity has made through capitalism. The website features news stories related to progress in such fields as science, economics, and quality of life. These news stories are curated from other sources such as
[CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/), [Sky News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news/), and [The Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/). They also feature original stories such as this: [How Much Should We Worry about Deep Fakes?](https://humanprogress.org/article.php?p=2107) This story is properly sourced to [TechDirt](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/techdirt/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and MIT.
Editorially, Human Progress favors the right through reporting on the positive benefits of capitalism. When it comes to science, they are generally pro-science, such as with
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), where they present [data without opinion](https://humanprogress.org/search?q=climate%20change). However, they also produce opinion-oriented articles that though factually accurate, mislead as to the other negative effects of climate change, such as this: [Ridley: Rejoice, the Earth Is Becoming Greener.](https://humanprogress.org/article.php?p=2018)
