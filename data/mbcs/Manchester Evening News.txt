History
[Manchestereveningnews.co.uk](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/about-us/) is the Manchester Evening News online edition, a daily newspaper covering Greater Manchester in North West England, UK. In 2010, the [Guardian Media Group](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) (GMG) [sold](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/09/guardian-media-group-trinity-mirror) Manchester Evening News (M.E.N.) and associated papers to Reach P.L.C. (then called Trinity Mirror) for £44.8 million. The sale ended GMG’s long-standing association with M.E.N., dating back to 1924.

Analysis / Bias
The Manchester Evening News reports the news using emotionally loaded language in their headlines, as seen in their article titled
[“Inflation shoots up again with food at highest prices for 45 years – what it means for you.”](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/inflation-shoots-up-again-food-26528659) Another example is the article titled “ [Transphobic material left inside gender identity books at Trafford Centre Waterstones,”](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/homophobic-material-left-inside-gender-26427813) “homophobic material,” and “Offensive material,” which suggests a negative view towards discriminatory behavior.
Regarding sourcing, they mostly use quotes and their sister organizations, such as the
[Daily Mirror](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mirror/).
Editorially, the article “
[UKIP on tour: Nige comes to town”](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/news-opinion/nigel-farage-comes-to-town-7028817) covers Nigel Farage’s visit to Manchester; UKIP is a right-wing populist political party in the U.K. The article’s use of the term “spin doctor” to describe Patrick O’Flynn and the suggestion that the event aimed to “go back to basics” could be seen as a negative portrayal of Farage and his party. In contrast, the newspaper’s coverage of Conservative PM Rishi Sunak, as seen in the article [Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visits Greater Manchester,”](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/pm-rishi-sunak-quizzed-in-26225011) where Sunak is quoted responding to questions, is factual and relatively neutral throughout.
