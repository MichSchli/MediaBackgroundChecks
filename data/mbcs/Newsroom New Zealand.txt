Analysis / Bias
Newsroom publishes news with emotionally loaded language, such as
[“An empty school and a policy half full.”](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/politics/an-empty-school-and-a-policy-half-full) A quote from the article reads: “Hipkins was momentarily energized facing a table of bright insects in the art room. I can see some familiar shapes in there, plastic bottles and coffee cups being used to create art, so that’s quite cool. No one interrupted the silence that followed..” The words are emotionally loaded and convey a negative perspective on the events described.
The article
[“Why it’s so hard to consent a wind farm”](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/sustainable-future/why-its-so-hard-to-consent-a-wind-farm) presents a balanced perspective by reporting on all sides of the issue, as evidenced by this quote from the article: “It’s possible that both have a point – a quicker pathway to consents and a wider land area that can be consented sounds like a compromise that would boost the construction of new wind and solar farms.” In this article, Newsroom uses quotes to provide sourcing from government officials, such as Environment Minister David Parker. Newsroom usually utilizes credible sources such as [here](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/podcast-the-detail/the-tigray-conflict), where they sourced the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/).
Editorially,
[Radio New Zealand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rnz-radio-new-zealand-bias/) criticizes Newsroom for publicizing anti-vaccination protesters during the pandemic in this article: [Newsroom accused of publicising anti-vax PR pitch](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/mediawatch/audio/2018832928/newsroom-accused-of-publicising-anti-vax-pr-pitch). The group responsible for the protests has a history of making false claims and promoting conspiracy theories regarding vaccines. While Newsroom did not openly endorse these conspiracy theories, giving equal time and a voice to such a group indicates a right-leaning bias.
