Further, they have a section called big gay news, which reports on political news and gay rights from around the world, such as this: [Malaysiaâ€™s Top Court To Hear Challenge To Law Which Punishes Gay Sex With Prison And Whipping](https://www.lavendermagazine.com/big-gay-news/malaysias-top-court-to-hear-challenge-to-law-which-punishes-gay-sex-with-prison-and-whipping/).

Editorially, they support liberal positions and frequently report negatively on the Trump administration:
[HIV-Positive Service Members Targeted By Trump Win Partial Victory](https://www.lavendermagazine.com/big-gay-news/hiv-positive-service-members-targeted-by-trump-win-partial-victory/). Generally, news reporting is factual, with a strong left bias in story selection and editorial positions.
