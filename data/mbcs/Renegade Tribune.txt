Analysis / Bias
The Renegade Tribune publishes news, commentary, and video from an extreme right-wing white supremacist perspective. Articles and headlines contain loaded hateful language such as
[The Satanic Temple Antics – Just Another Jewish Divide And Conquer Organization](http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-satanic-temple-antics-just-another-jewish-divide-and-conquer-organization/) and this [How jews Are Transfering Their Sins to “White Chicks.”](http://www.renegadetribune.com/how-jews-are-transfering-their-sins-to-white-chicks/)
Besides peddling hate, they also promote conspiracy theories such as
[false flags](http://www.renegadetribune.com/israeli-mossad-would-be-false-flag-terrorist-attack-at-the-mexican-congress/), [Israel responsible for 9-11](http://www.renegadetribune.com/truth-hertz-israel-did-9-11/), [white genocide,](http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-worldwide-food-shortage-is-a-plot-for-more-white-genocide/) and articles like this [Mandatory Anti-White CRT Trainings](http://www.renegadetribune.com/mandatory-anti-white-crt-trainings/).
The Renegade Tribune also promotes pseudoscience, such as the Covid-19 vaccine being dangerous and the old debunked claim that vaccines cause autism
[Yes, Vaccines Cause Autism](http://www.renegadetribune.com/yes-vaccines-cause-autism/). Vaccines [do not cause autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8207024/). Other topics include Chemtrails, [We Are Sprayed Like Bugs – Arizona Speaks Out Against Chemtrails](http://www.renegadetribune.com/we-are-sprayed-like-bugs-arizona-speaks-out-against-chemtrails/), and HIV not being the probable cause of AIDS [Nobel Prize Winner Challenges the Myth About AIDS](http://www.renegadetribune.com/nobel-prize-winner-challenges-the-myth-about-aids/). HIV is the [primary cause of AIDS](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/aids-and-hiv#:~:text=Human%20immunodeficiency%20virus%20(HIV)%20is,life%2Dthreatening%20infections%20and%20cancers.).
In general, the Renegade Tribune is a hate group that is rarely factual.
