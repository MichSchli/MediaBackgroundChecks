History
Launched in 2013, LibertyTalk.FM is a website that broadcasts live radio programming 24 hours per day. According to their
[about page](https://libertytalk.fm/about/) “LibertyTalk FM broadcasts 24 hours per day, seven days per week and features continuous live content Monday through Friday and a mix of the best-syndicated podcasts and shows during the weekend. Our current line up of hosts includes the best and brightest voices fervently advocating for Liberty, such as Ernest Hancock, [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), Todd “Bubba” Horwitz, Ian Freeman, The Freedom Feens.”
The website lists an address to a
[Virtual Office in Chicago](https://liquidspace.com/us/il/chicago/chicago-virtual-office) and a [mailing address](https://libertytalk.fm/contact/) to a [mailbox rental company](https://www.bbb.org/us/in/indianapolis/profile/mail-box-rental/signius-communications-inc-0382-14000095) in Indiana. Other than these, there is a lack of transparency in regard to ownership and business model.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features live internet radio broadcasts, on-demand podcasts, and news stories. The most notable radio broadcast is the
[Alex Jones Show](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/). Alex Jones is a well known extreme right conspiracy theorist and promoter of pseudoscience who makes [false claims](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/alex-jones/). The website also features news stories and opinion pieces that often use loaded emotional wording such as this: [President Trump: Please Pardon Edward Snowden to Defeat DEEP STATE Coup](https://libertytalk.fm/president-trump-pardon-edward-snowden-defeat-deep-state-coup/). A quote from the article reads, “their anger unmasked & laid bare: it was wholly obvious that you shook the DEEP STATE to their rotten core and they were already scheming to double-down on seeking revenge.”
Editorially, LibertyTalk.fm leans strongly right with advocacy for small government,
[free-market capitalism](https://libertytalk.fm/free-markets-dont-need-artificial-stimulation/), and skepticism regarding human influence on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as this: [Climate Change Fear Mongers’ Horrible Track Record](https://libertytalk.fm/climate-change-predictions-inaccurate-earth-day/). The [consensus of climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) is that the earth is currently warming at an accelerated pace due to human’s use of fossil fuels. From a story selection standpoint, virtually all stories favor the Libertarian Right.
Failed Fact Checks
- A factual search reveals that LibertyTalk.fm has not been fact-checked by an IFCN fact checker; however, the radio broadcasts of the Alex Jones show have made several false claims such as this:
[Infowars’ Alex Jones wrong about Alabama Senate recount](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/dec/14/alex-jones/infowars-jones-wrong-about-alabama-recount/)and [No, Hillary Clinton did not meet with Broward elections supervisor Brenda Snipes](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/31/roger-stone/no-roger-stone-hillary-clinton-did-not-meet-browar/).
