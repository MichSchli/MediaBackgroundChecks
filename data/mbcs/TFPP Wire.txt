History
On February 8, 2024, TFPP Wire began publishing content that was usually found on the Federalists Papers Project.
[Founded in 2011](http://whois.domaintools.com/thefederalistpapers.org), The Federalist Papers Project was a far-right news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://tfppwire.com/about-us/), the mission of the [Federalist Papers Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist-papers-project/) “is to get people the power that knowledge gives to motivate them to push back at the erosion of our liberties and restore the constitutionally limited small government.” The founder and director of FPP is [Steve Straub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sstraub?trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1).
As of this date thefederalistpapers.org domain redirects to tfppwire.com.

Funded by / Ownership
The former website was owned by
[Integrated Marketing Group](http://www.buzzfile.com/business/Integrated-Marketing-Group,-Inc.-916-790-8121), which Steve Straub owns. The TFPP website lacks transparency as it does not disclose ownership; however, it is assumed to be owned by the same company/person. At this time, there is no advertising on the website, and it is unclear how they are funded or generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The TFPP Wire does not produce original reporting but rather summarizes and republishes news stories that derive from other outlets. Articles and headlines sometimes contain emotionally loaded language like this
[Soros Set to Take Huge Stake in 220 Radio Stations Right Before Elections, ‘This is Scary’](https://tfppwire.com/soros-stake-220-radio-stations/) and [San Francisco Banned Algebra Being Taught in 8th Grade Over ‘Equity,’ It Backfired Big Time](https://tfppwire.com/san-francisco-banned-algebra-being-taught-in-8th-grade-over-equity-it-backfired-big-time/).
When it comes to sourcing, they rely on a mix of low-biased, highly factual sources like the
[San Francisco Chronicle](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/san-francisco-chronicle/) and questionable sources like the [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/).
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion pieces, which routinely favor a conservative perspective, such as this
[Biological Male Wins Girls High Jump Competition, ‘Country is Full of Failing, Gutless Mothers and Fathers’](https://tfppwire.com/biological-male-wins-girls-high-jump-competition-country-is-full-of-failing-gutless-mothers-and-fathers/). Essentially, TFPP Wire produces the same content that was found on the Federalist Papers Project website. At this time the articles that were housed on the Federalist Papers Project are no longer available, which means their failed fact checks are also gone.
In general, TFPP Wire strongly promotes a right-leaning bias and sometimes relies on poor sources. Since TFPP Wire is a new website and has not failed any fact-checks to date, we will upgrade them from Questionable to Right Biased and factually mixed based on a lack of transparency and sometimes relying on poor sources.
