Analysis / Bias
In review, Mediaite reports news with a left-leaning bias through both story selection and wording such as this,
[Trump Fumes After Watching MSNBC, Takes Aim at Parent Company: ‘Such Lies’](https://www.mediaite.com/trump/trump-fumes-after-watching-msnbc-takes-aim-at-parent-company-such-lies/) and [Trump’s Bizarre Statement About the Moon and Mars Rockets Across Twitter](https://www.mediaite.com/trump/trumps-bizarre-statement-about-the-moon-and-mars-rockets-across-twitter/). This latter story is sourced from just tweets. Sourcing, in general, seems to come from social media and Youtube videos frequently.
Story selection almost always favors the left and utilizes sensational headlines. Generally, this is a strongly left-leaning source that selects stories that favor the left and does not always source properly.
