Funded by / Ownership
Ukrinform is a
[state-controlled news agency](https://www.ukrinform.net/info/services.html) established as the legal successor to the former Ukrainian National News Agency. It is governed by a government decree and led by a board whose members are appointed by the General Director, who in turn is appointed by the government. A supervisory board at Ukrinform is approved by the government. The agency’s funding primarily comes from the state, with over 80% of its budget comprised of state subsidies, supplemented by commercial revenues mainly from content sales.
Analysis / Bias
Ukrinform is controlled by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. This state control implies a potential government influence in its reporting. Articles from Ukrinform, such as those about the crash death of
[Wagner boss Prigozhin’s plane](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3736110-putin-intends-to-maintain-wagner-group-but-without-prigozhin-isw.html), suggest a focus on significant political and social events.
News headlines are usually minimally biased. For example,
[Lithuania allocates EUR 1M to Ukraine through CEB’s fund](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/3795692-lithuania-allocates-eur-1m-to-ukraine-through-cebs-fund.html). However, when covering the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there is significant use of emotionally charged language against Russia, such as this [Enemy continues infantry-led attacks, suffers heavy losses in Maryinka, Avdiivka sectors](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3795772-enemy-continues-infantryled-attacks-suffers-heavy-losses-in-maryinka-avdiivka-sectors.html), and [Putin stepping up his invasion of Ukraine, sending more Russians to die](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3792522-putin-stepping-up-his-invasion-of-ukraine-sending-more-russians-to-die-uk-defense-minister.html).
While most content is fact-based, the government ownership structure leads to the promotion of pro-government and pro-Ukrainian propaganda, especially as it relates to the conflict with Russia. Therefore, we assign Ukrinform a right-leaning bias reflective of the government and mixed factual reporting due to the promotion of propaganda.
