Analysis / Bias
The articles on America Insider often focus on conservative viewpoints and are critical of liberal policies and figures. For example, an article titled
[“Impeachment Inquiry Demanded Over Biden’s 5K Alias Emails”](https://www.americainsider.org/2023/08/30/impeachment-inquiry-demanded-over-bidens-5k-alias-emails/) uses phrases like “Demanded Over Biden’s” to suggest a sense of urgency and scandal. In addition, in the article, the hyperlink labeled “discovered” leads back to the same website, creating a circular reference. This practice raises questions about the article’s credibility as it doesn’t allow for independent verification of the information. The article relies heavily on statements from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a known conservative figure, without providing counter-arguments or perspectives from other parties, making it unbalanced reporting.
Another article,
[“Biden Sets All-Time Presidential Record,”](https://www.americainsider.org/2023/08/07/biden-sets-all-time-presidential-record-2/?_gl=1*19r1632*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU3Njk2NjM0Ny4xNjkzNjU4MTA1*_ga_GEK4P3X8QM*MTY5MzY1ODEwNC4xLjEuMTY5MzY1OTUyOC4wLjAuMA..) uses emotionally charged language. The tone of the article is critical and seems to push a narrative against [Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/): “Biden has been on vacation for roughly 40% of his time in office” and “Critics have pointed out that Biden has been on vacation for an entire year, even though his vacation days are not consecutive.” indicate a biased perspective.
The article does not provide a balanced view and leans heavily on presenting Biden in a negative light. The article cites the
[Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) and social media posts as its source. They also cite various polls like [Gallup Poll](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gallup/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/)/Ipsos Poll, and [CNN’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/) “Poll of Polls” to support their claims. However, it does not provide hyperlinks to these sources for verification.
In general, americaInsider.org leans toward the right in its political orientation. The website uses biased wording and sometimes sensationalist framing to present news stories. While the articles are based on factual events, the way they are presented could be seen as aiming to provoke a specific emotional or political response from the reader.
