Analysis / Bias
The DV Journal utilizes strong loaded words in headlines and articles, such as
[Despite Ties to China, Both PA U.S. Senators Use TikTok](https://delawarevalleyjournal.com/despite-ties-to-china-both-pa-u-s-senators-use-tiktok/). However, they typically present both sides of political news, such as [Industry Execs Praise Biden’s Call for Congress to Prevent Rail Strike](https://delawarevalleyjournal.com/industry-execs-praise-bidens-call-for-congress-to-prevent-rail-strike/). DV Journal usually uses credible sources to support their information, such as [Reason](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/), bls.gov, and [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/).
In opinion pieces regarding economics and climate change, DV Journal has a right-leaning bias and utilizes sources such as the corporately funded
[National Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-center-public-policy-research-ncppr/), which does not always support the consensus of science regarding climate change. Some authors downplay [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and its impacts, such as this [Hypocrisy Abounds at Climate Summit.](https://delawarevalleyjournal.com/lomborg-hypocrisy-abounds-at-climate-summit/) This story is written by Bjorn Lomborg, the author of the book “False Alarm — How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.” Lomborg believes that climate change is [occurring](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/30/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-profile) and humans are responsible but disputes that the effects and economic impacts will be negative. Finally, Lomborg has made [false and unsupported claims](https://climatefeedback.org/claimreview/global-warming-contributes-to-increased-heat-related-mortality-contrary-to-bjorn-lomborgs-unsupported-claims-that-climate-change-is-saving-hundreds-of-thousands-of-lives-each-year/) regarding climate change.
