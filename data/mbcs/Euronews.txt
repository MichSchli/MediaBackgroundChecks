Analysis / Bias
In review, Euronews publishes European and International news, often paring text and video from the TV station. News stories use minimal loaded biased language such as this:
[Drone attacks cause fires and explosions at Saudi oil refineries](https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/14/drone-attacks-on-saudi-aramco-facilities-saudi-media). This story is appropriately sourced through video, tweets, and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). The website also publishes news from [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/).
