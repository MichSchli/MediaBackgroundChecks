Analysis / Bias
Meditech Today publishes news and information related to the Medical Technology industry. Articles and headlines are minimally biased in word choices, such as
[Air Ai Unleashes the Customer Service Renaissance: Redefining Excellence in the Digital Era](https://meditechtoday.com/air-ai-unleashes-customer-service-renaissance/). Although not labeled promotional, it primarily emphasizes the product’s benefits and lacks critical balance.
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they do report on political issues related to the industry, like
[Don’t Wait for the Latest Gadget to Improve Your Mental Health](https://meditechtoday.com/improve-your-mental-health/). In reviewing dozens, a slight majority of politically related pieces lean slightly left in favoring a liberal perspective. In general, they are fact-based, but the content sometimes blurs the lines by not indicating which stories are promotional.
