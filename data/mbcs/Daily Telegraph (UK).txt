The Telegraph was
[founded](https://corporate.telegraph.co.uk/about-us/) by Colonel Arthur B. Sleigh, in June 1855, as The Daily Telegraph and Courier. [Joseph Moses Levy](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Moses-Levy), the owner of the Sunday Times, was the first publisher of the newspaper. Later, Levy became the owner of the paper. In 1937, after merging with the Morning Post, it became the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, and in 1969, it became [The Daily Telegraph](https://corporate.telegraph.co.uk/about-us/), sometimes referred to as The Telegraph.

Analysis / Bias
According to
[The Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/), in 2015, The Telegraph urged its readers to [vote Conservative](https://www.ft.com/content/f4914cac-a7ce-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879) via email from its editor Chris Evans. As a result, the paper was fined £30,000 by the data regulator, [the independent office](https://www.businessinsider.com/telegraph-fined-for-telling-their-readers-to-vote-tory-2015-12) that regulates the organization’s data use. Further, The Telegraph is strongly biased in favor of the Conservative party, earning the nickname [“Daily Torygraph.”](https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/apr/01/telegraph-is-the-torygraph-again-with-this-conservative-propaganda)
During the 2017 elections, The Telegraph backed
[Theresa May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May) ( Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party since [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_2016)): [“Vote Conservative for an independent, prosperous Britain.”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2017/06/03/vote-conservative-independent-prosperous-britain/) Here is a quote from the article demonstrating conservative bias “Only Theresa May has the attitude and the experience necessary to get the job done – and to get it done in the cleanest, most comprehensive way. Jeremy Corbyn is not only incompetent and wrongheaded but dangerous.” They also publish articles strongly biased against the Labor party such as this: [“A Corbyn government would be a calamity – everything else is just noise](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2017/06/06/corbyn-government-would-calamity-everything-else-just-noise/).”
The Telegraph also republishes stories from credible news media such as
[Reuters](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/reuters/) and the [Associated Press](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/associated-press/).
The Telegraph regularly utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines and sources poorly through
[quotations](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/11/stratford-upon-avon-residents-object-eyesore-chinese-pavilion/) or self-referral sourcing. They also routinely publish clickbait tabloid-style news such as “ [Is this workout the secret to Jennifer Aniston’s youthful physique at 50?”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/secret-jennifer-anistons-youthful-physique-50/) and crime stories in their News section: “ [Libby Squire suspect charged with stealing sex toys and knickers from other women months before the disappearance of student.”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/10/libby-squire-suspect-remains-investigation-police-charge-unrelated/)
In the past, The Telegraph issued an
[apology letter](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/26/melania-trump-apology/) to Melania Trump for publishing false statements regarding her family and her modeling career and also agreed to pay substantial damages’ over the article they published about the First Lady. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 43% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 22% do not, ranking them #9 in trust of the major UK news providers.
