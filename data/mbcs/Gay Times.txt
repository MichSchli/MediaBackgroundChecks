Analysis / Bias
Gay Times publishes news and information for the LGBTQ community. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[“Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has delayed the conversion therapy ban,”](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/equalities-minister-kemi-badenoch-has-delayed-the-conversion-therapy-ban/) and [“Josh Cavallo says he “lost respect” for FIFA after OneLove armband ban.”](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/josh-cavallo-says-he-lost-respect-for-fifa-after-onelove-armband-ban/) A quote from the second article reads: “I love my identity, seeing you have banned all teams to wear the One Love armband to actively support LGBTQ+ at the World cup. You have lost my respect.” The article is sourced from Instagram.
Regarding sourcing, they rely on credible sources such as
[Vice News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vice-news/) and [Channel 4 news](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/channel-4-news-uk/). They also cover [Drag Race](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/originals/drag-race-uk-stars-black-peppa-and-cheddar-gorgeous-reflect-on-super-competitive-season-4/), life & culture, fashion, and entertainment news. Further, they have a section called amplify, which reports on the news worldwide, such as this: [ “Bilal Baig is the South Asian star making queer Canadian TV history.”](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/amplify/bilal-baig-is-the-south-asian-star-making-queer-canadian-tv-history/)
Editorially, they support liberal positions; for example, in this article, they positively cover progressive US politician Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
[“AOC slams anti-LGBTQ+ legislator Lauren Boebert for Colorado shooting response.“](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/aoc-slams-anti-lgbtq-legislator-lauren-boebert-for-colorado-shooting-response/) They also report negatively on former President Trump: [”Donald Trump launches presidential bid with anti-trans speech.”](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/donald-trump-launches-presidential-bid-with-anti-trans-speech/) Although these articles are biased, they again rely on credible sources such as [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [GLAAD](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/glaad/), [Military Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-times/), and [The Advocate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/advocate/). Generally, news reporting is factual, with a strong left bias in story selection and editorial positions.
