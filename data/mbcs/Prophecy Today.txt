Analysis / Bias
In review, the website generally promotes pseudoscience related to the bible and creationism. It is difficult to analyze this site based on its age and lack of search capabilities. For the most part, they serve as a pro-Israel newsfeed using credible sources such as the
[Jerusalem Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-jerusalem-post/) and [ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/), as well as anti-Islamic sites such as [Front Page Magazine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontpage-magazine/). Most stories favor the right such as this [Why the Left Hates Religion](http://prophecytoday.com/). In general, Prophecy Today is a right-leaning pseudoscience website.
