Analysis / Bias
Action Network is a platform that supports progressive causes and movements. It provides tools and resources that have been used by various organizations, including the Women’s March,
[Black Lives Matter](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/black-lives-matter/), Common Cause, United We Dream, AFL-CIO, and the Poor People’s Campaign. The network’s digital platform helps these organizations mobilize and organize their supporters, meeting a need for the progressive movement. Additionally, Action Network claims that its tools helped the [Democratic National Committee (DNC)](https://actionnetwork.org/about-us/) raise millions of dollars for candidates and organizations.
The organization’s primary focus is on progressive issues, indicating a left-leaning bias. However, the exact degree of bias may vary depending on the specific campaigns and initiatives supported through the platform. For example, the
[petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/add-your-name-for-new-leadership-at-the-dnc?nowrapper=true&referrer=&source=fb) hosted on Action Network, sponsored by Citizen Action of New York, calls for new leadership at the Democratic National Committee (DNC). It advocates for Rep. Keith Ellison, co-chair of the Progressive Caucus in Congress, to lead the DNC, arguing that the Democratic party should represent working families over corporations and big donors. The petition implies dissatisfaction with the current DNC leadership under Jaime Harrison without directly criticizing him. The petition described Rep. Keith Ellison as “one of just a few Congress members to back Bernie Sanders in the primary.”
Another blog post titled “
[Action Network & Action Builder partner with Trader Joe’s United to build a national movement”](https://actionnetwork.blog/action-network-action-builder-partner-with-trader-joes-united-to-build-a-national-movement/) discusses their partnership with Trader Joe’s United, a union aiming to create a national movement of unionized stores. The language used is positive, emphasizing the success and impact of the unionization efforts. However, the article lacks opposing viewpoints, which could indicate a bias toward the unionization movement, which reflects the organization’s perspective and advocacy for progressive causes.
