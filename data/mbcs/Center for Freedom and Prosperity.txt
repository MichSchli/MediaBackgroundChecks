Analysis / Bias
In review, the CF&P advocates for low taxes, limited government, and the preservation of territorial tax shelters. The website consists of a blog, news, opinion, and foundation studies. The blog consists of original articles written by CF&P staff that utilizes moderately loaded words such as this:
[BANGING THE DRUM FOR TAX INCREASES AT THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.](http://freedomandprosperity.org/2019/blog/banging-the-drum-for-tax-increases-at-the-international-monetary-fund/) Blog posts are typically properly sourced.
The news section publishes press releases by CF&P, and the opinion section uses strongly loaded words that favor the right such as this:
[DEMOCRATS’ GREEN ENERGY CRUSADES ARE ALWAYS CATASTROPHIC](http://freedomandprosperity.org/2019/opinion-and-commentary/democrats-green-energy-crusades-are-always-catastrophic/). This particular piece comes from the strongly right biased and questionable [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/). Other articles are republished from right-leaning sources such as the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) and [Inside Sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/insidesources/).

In general, all stories favor the right, and there is a rejection of the scientific consensus regarding climate change.
