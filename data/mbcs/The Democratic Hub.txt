Analysis / Bias
In review, the Democratic Hub publishes a blog and republishes news stories from other sources; however, the primary purpose is to serve as a forum for discussion. This source uses strong loaded words that favor Democrats and discredits Republicans, such as this
[Trump’s Twitter Account Permanently Suspended, Finally](https://www.democratichub.com/blogs/409/trumps-twitter-account-permanently-suspended-finally). All content is written by member bloggers and is highly opinionated, which matches their appropriate description. At least they are honest in who they are. In general, there is plenty of credible information here, but because anyone can publish information, it may not always be factual.
