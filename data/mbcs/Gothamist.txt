Analysis / Bias
In review, the Gothamist publishes news about New York City, Arts & Entertainment, and Food. For this review, we will focus on news reporting. News reporting features two styles, some are straightforward and low biased such as this:
[Is This The Beginning Of The End For Free Parking In NYC?](https://gothamist.com/news/beginning-end-free-parking-nyc) and others are snarky in tone and often favor the left, such as this: [Donald Trump Ditches New York, Declares Palm Beach His ‘Primary Residence](https://gothamist.com/news/donald-trump-ditches-new-york-declares-palm-beach-his-primary-residence).’ Both of these stories are properly sourced from mainstream outlets such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [New York Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/)
Editorially, the story selection leans moderately left, such as this:
