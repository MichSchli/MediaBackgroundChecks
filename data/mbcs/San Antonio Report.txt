As a reader-supported nonprofit newsroom, our coverage is never behind a paywall, and we are able to publish without any obligation to outside owners or interests.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The website reports on San Antonio and the surrounding area, providing comprehensive coverage of local elections, educational challenges, business developments, and health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic. It also features special reports and offers content in both English and Spanish. Additionally, it publishes news from
[The Texas Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/texas-tribune/), another nonprofit news site.
San Antonio Report generally relies on original reporting, including interviews with local officials and experts. News articles and reports typically do not use loaded emotional language like this
[Immigrant rights groups sue Texas to halt new law allowing arrests of migrants](https://sanantonioreport.org/texas-lawsuit-immigration-law/).
Editorially, they properly label opinion content. An analysis of opinion pieces reveals that more favor the left, such as this
[A nation founded by immigrants needs to safeguard its values](https://sanantonioreport.org/a-nation-founded-by-immigrants-needs-to-safeguard-its-values/), and this in support of Ron Nirenberg, a progressive independent Mayor of San Antonio: [Nirenberg legacy to be shaped by proposed charter changes](https://sanantonioreport.org/san-antonio-city-charter-election-nirenberg-legacy/). In general, the reporting is fact-based and holds left-leaning editorial biases.
