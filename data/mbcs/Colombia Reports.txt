Analysis / Bias
According to
[Reporters Without Borders (RSF)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/), “Colombia continues to be one of the western hemisphere’s most dangerous countries for the media.”
Colombia Reports provides national news and analysis regarding issues in Latin America. They utilize minimally loaded words in their articles and occasionally use credible sources such as
[narconews.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narco_News) (editorially left-leaning) or [derechos.org ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derechos_Human_Rights) (an international human rights organization with their primary focus being on Latin America). Typically, Colombia Reports sources either by heavily quoting or linking to their own site, which has a left-center bias. For example, [this article](https://colombiareports.com/approval-rating-colombias-santos-sinks-lowest-point-since-election/) mentions a lot of statistics without a single link for verification. Colombia Reports has a least biased tone regarding [US news](https://colombiareports.com/us-will-again-give-391m-in-aid-to-colombia-despite-trump-effort-at-cuts/).
