History
Founded in 2015 by an anonymous Biologist who goes under the pseudonym Fallacy Man, The Logic of Science is a blog that aims to teach how to think critically with logic and reason. According to their
[about page](https://thelogicofscience.com/about/), they state their mission as to “Teach critical thinking, explain how science works and why it is reliable, and use critical thinking to defend science against the numerous logically flawed attacks that are hurled at it.”
Fallacy Man
[states](https://thelogicofscience.com/about/) that “because of the vitriol and ad hominem assaults that tend to get hurled at people who take a public stand on these issues, I am disinclined to post much in the way of personal details. So I will simply summarize by stating that I have a B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in biology and am currently a post-doctoral researcher at a university.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Logic of Science (Fallacy Man) researches and debunks false and misleading information related to science. For example, his most recent post debunks 30 myths/falsehoods regarding Covid-19 and the vaccines
[Debunking 30 bad arguments about COVID/vaccines](https://thelogicofscience.com/2022/01/19/debunking-30-bad-arguments-about-covid-vaccines/). In this article, he lists 30 different falsehoods that can be found spreading around social media or in poor quality publications such as “Bad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA.” Fallacy Man explains why this is not true, citing evidence.
The Logic of Science covers the scientific issues that create the most controversy and hence false information. They heavily cover climate change and those who deny the human influence or minimize the effects of global warming. In the article
[The overwhelming consensus on climate change](https://thelogicofscience.com/2020/01/20/the-overwhelming-consensus-on-climate-change/), the author accurately points out that scientific consensus is nearly universal on human-influenced climate change. He demonstrates with evidence that despite attempts to prove that there is not a strong consensus, the evidence is [overwhelming](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0270467617707079).
The website also covers the consensus on the safety and benefits of GMOs, Vaccines and debunks the efficacy of alternative health/medicines. Finally, The Logic of Science provides educational articles on creating and detecting valid arguments
[The importance of logical fallacies](https://thelogicofscience.com/2017/03/14/the-importance-of-logical-fallacies/). Generally, Fallacy Man teaches people how to think critically and apply the basics learned in a college-level philosophy class. From a political bias perspective, it is now considered liberal/progressive/left to hold pro-science views, which quite frankly is sad.
