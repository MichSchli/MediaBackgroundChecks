Analysis / Bias
In review, News Blaze has an extreme right-wing bias in reporting, such as: “
[George Soros The Terrorist Financier”](http://newsblaze.com/usnews/politics/george-soros-is-a-terrorist_84660/). Most of their political news favors the right and is anti-left. They also frequently use emotion invoking rhetoric in their headlines and articles. Sometimes they refer to Questionable propaganda sources such as [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/) and other times they don’t source at all and promote conspiracies, such as this: “ [As The Deep State Unravels](http://newsblaze.com/thoughts/cartoons/as-the-deep-state-unravels_83108/).”
Article headlines are frequently emotional such as this
[Renewable Energy Risks Destroying The Environment and Economy](https://newsblaze.com/business/finance/renewable-energy-risks-destroying-environment_166337/). This story is sourced to organizations that deny or minimize human-influenced [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) such as the [Heartland Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/) and [Watts Up with That](https://newsblaze.com/business/finance/renewable-energy-risks-destroying-environment_166337/). Another story with over-the-top denigrating wording and a complete lack of sourcing is this [Colin Powell Endorsed Sleepy Creepy Joe Biden Over Trump](https://newsblaze.com/thoughts/cartoons/colin-powell-endorsed-sleepy-creepy-joe-biden-over-trump_165728/). Finally, they also publish misleading or false news regarding Covid-19 such as this [COVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure](https://newsblaze.com/usnews/health/covid-19-no-vaccine-needed-there-is-already-a-cure_166305/?fbclid=IwAR2MMYdmkrdu_hrvceRZ1XLXc8lZhdmaSxwAh3hiE6T7MkoNGvnRB0s8DDE). There currently is not a cure for Covid-19.
