Analysis / Bias
In review, Great American Daily does not produce original news reporting but rather uses existing news stories and offers biased commentary around the content. Headlines are often sensationalized to favor the right such as this:
[Jeanine Pirro Destroyed Adam Schiff’s Star Impeachment Witness With Two Words](https://greatamericandaily.com/jeanine-pirro-destroyed-adam-schiffs-star-impeachment-witness-with-two-words/), and this [Devin Nunes Sent Schiff Into a Fit of Rage With a Fact About Imlastent](https://greatamericandaily.com/devin-nunes-sent-schiff-into-a-fit-of-rage-with-a-fact-about-impeachment/). This last story is sourced from the Questionable [Black Eye Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/black-eye-politics-bias-credibility-rating/). Some stories do not offer sourcing at all, while others use poor sources such as Conservative Revival and Rush Limbaugh (deceased), who had a t [errible track record with facts](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/).
Editorially, virtually every story denigrates liberals while glorifying conservatives and, in particular, former President Trump. They also have a section dedicated to
[Deep State](https://greatamericandaily.com/category/deep-state/) conspiracy theories as well as a [section](https://greatamericandaily.com/category/bill-and-hillary-clinton/) to report negatively on the Clintons. In this section, they promote far right-wing conspiracies about the [Clintons’ ties to pedophilia](https://greatamericandaily.com/this-video-shows-one-disturbing-link-between-bill-clinton-and-a-child-sex-scandal/) and the [Clintons’ murdering people](https://greatamericandaily.com/new-evidence-in-a-suspicious-death-has-thrown-bill-clinton-into-a-panic/). In general, this is a right-wing propaganda website that is low on facts.
Since 2020, they have published misinformation regarding
[election fraud](https://greatamericandaily.com/?s=election+fraud) and promoted the Stolen Election narrative.
