Analysis / Bias
Belltower.News covers far-right movements and activities, including the Alt-Right, racism, Islamophobia, and antisemitism, and publishes articles on symbols and language codes used by the German right-wing and current debates on the right-wing scene.
With a left-leaning perspective, it often features stories critical of far-right policies and covers social justice issues such as LGBTQ+ and racial justice. One such critical article, titled
[“TERFS – TRANSPHOBIA AND FAR-RIGHT FEMINISM,”](https://www.belltower.news/kolumne-michaela-dudley-terfs-transfeindlichkeit-und-rechtsradikaler-feminismus-148977/) explains the definition of trans-exclusionary radical feminists who advocate for excluding trans people.
Belltower.News is critical of TERFs and their alliances with far-right groups. The article also reports on an incident where
[Australia’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/australia-media-profile/) first Indigenous Senator and a trans community supporter, Lidia Thorpe, was pushed to the ground by security forces at an anti-trans rally. However, the accuracy of the information provided in the article cannot be verified without hyperlinks to another source. [The Sydney Morning Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-sydney-morning-herald/) reported the same event under the title [“Senator Lidia Thorpe clashes with police at anti-trans rally,”](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/senator-lidia-thorpe-clashes-with-police-at-anti-trans-rally-20230323-p5cunr.html) confirming the factual accuracy of the Belltower.News report.
In a parallel to the cooperation between feminist and far-right groups targeting trans people, Belltower.News’ report identifies a partnership between progressive or left-wing groups and far-right groups who overlook their ideological differences and unite against anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism, as seen in this article:
[“Anti-Americanism HATE OBJECT: USA.”](https://www.belltower.news/anti-americanism-hate-object-usa-145341/) In general, the article presents a one-sided perspective that lacks objectivity and engages in oversimplification and poor sourcing; therefore, we rate Belltower.News as left-leaning editorially and Mostly Factual rather than High based on poor sourcing and one-sided reporting.
