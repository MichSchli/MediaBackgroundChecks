Analysis / Bias
Kronen Zeitung’s coverage of national politics, particularly regarding Karl Nehammer, the current Chancellor and the acting chairman of the Populist right-wing The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), is critical in tone and wording. For example, in this article,
[“What is behind Chancellor Nehammer’s visit to Kyiv,”](https://www.krone.at/2675611) the columnist states his opinion regarding Nehammer’s visit to Ukraine as a distraction from corruption and scandals within his party.
A quote from the article reads, “When Nehammer travels as chancellor, he spares himself a few days of discussions about issues that overtake him as ÖVP leader: for example, dubious money flows from his party; in Vorarlberg and elsewhere and criticism of National Council President Wolfgang Sobotka.” He ends his analysis by stating, “Curiously enough, a real theater of war becomes a distraction from the party-political war in Austria.”
On the other hand, Kronen Zeitung’s coverage of Far-Right party leader Herbert Kickl is positive, as in this article where the columnist compares the leader of the Far-Right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) Herbert Kickl with center-left SPÖ leader Rendi-Wagner and concludes he is very good at everything he does
[“Kickl can do almost everything better.”](https://www.krone.at/2442831)
A quote from the article reads, “Kickl can speak more pointedly than SPÖ leader Rendi-Wagner. Kickl can drive the turquoise-green government better than NEOS boss Meinl-Reisinger, Kickl can make more noise in parliament than Parliament President Sobotka, Kickl can scare “foreigners” better than Minister Raab, Kickl can be a lot funnier than Interior Minister Nehammer, Kickl can provoke Brussels better than Foreign Minister Schallenberg.”
