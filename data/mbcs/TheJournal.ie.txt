Analysis / Bias
In review, TheJournal.ie publishes editorials with emotionally loaded language such as this “’
[Trump should have no place in your remarks about Irish media, Taoiseach’”](https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/leo-varadkar-trump-media-opinion-4109097-Jul2018/) and loaded headlines in an interview with Allan Kelly leader of Irish Labor Party (Center-Left) [“It’s like Jesus, they’re back’: Alan Kelly on FF’s return, Coveney’s garda car ‘shame’, and advice for the Greens”](https://www.thejournal.ie/alan-kelly-2-5146070-Jul2020/). Politically, op-eds mostly align with the left on the issues. For example, in this op-ed: [Malcolm Byrne: I worry we are entering a Trumpian era of divided politics in Ireland](https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/us-election-5264110-Nov2020/) and this [To tackle income poverty and inequality, we need to fully understand the complexities of the data](https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/seamus-coffey-poverty-5250352-Nov2020/).
TheJournal.ie is also an
[IFCN fact checker](https://www.ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/profile/thejournalie-factcheck) with fact checks such as this [ “FactCheck: Does abortion increase the risk of a woman developing breast cancer?”](https://www.thejournal.ie/does-abortion-increase-risk-of-breast-cancer-3994788-May2018/) They utilize credible sources such as [rte. ie](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rte-radio-television-ireland/) and the britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk. Local news is covered through journalists with minimal loaded words such as this [“Coronavirus: Four deaths and 344 new cases confirmed in Ireland.”](https://www.thejournal.ie/covid-cases-ireland-3-5274522-Nov2020/) International news occasionally uses loaded words, sometimes directed at former President Donald Trump [“Trump throws transition into turmoil while refusing to concede. ”](https://www.thejournal.ie/trump-throws-transition-into-turmoil-while-refusing-to-concede-5261768-Nov2020/) In general, TheJournal.ie holds a left-leaning editorial bias and is factual in reporting.
