Analysis / Bias
Futurity is a science and technology news website that publishes articles on research from universities worldwide. When the site launched in 2009,
[Scientific American](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/scientific-american/) published an article titled [“Futurity” service launches to promote university research as traditional science journalism declines.”](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/futurity-service-launches-to-promot-2009-09-18/) The article mentions criticisms from journalists and media critics about the lack of transparency surrounding Futurity’s funding and ownership. A quote from the article reads,” Futurity and its consumers would benefit from complete transparency on its site as to who is managing and editing the site and how it is funded.” This information is still not available as of 2023.
The articles are well-written, concise, and usually based on reputable universities’ published studies. An example is
[“Target Could Lead to More Effective Glaucoma Treatment”](https://www.futurity.org/glaucoma-vision-eyes-2888482-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=glaucoma-vision-eyes-2888482-2) and [“There’s More to Honesty than not Lying.”](https://www.futurity.org/honesty-lying-communication-2888082/) The articles are well-sourced using credible sources such as Indiana University, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, Wake Forest University, Carnegie Mellon, and [journals.aom.org](https://journals.aom.org/). At the bottom of the page, it also mentions who funded the study, such as “The John Templeton Foundation funded the work.” Generally, articles do not contain any overt political bias.
Futurity generally publishes factual articles that present research clearly and objectively and are well-sourced, but they lack transparency and have failed a fact check.
