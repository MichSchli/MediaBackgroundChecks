Analysis / Bias
In review, Women are Human primarily publishes news stories that negatively portray transgender men who identify as female. Most stories focus on crimes committed, such as this
[Prominent Transgender-Identifying Figure Arrested for Terroristic Threats Against Female Bar Manager.](https://www.womenarehuman.com/prominent-transgender-identifying-figure-arrested-for-terroristic-threats-against-female-bar-manager/) This story is properly sourced to local Pittsburgh media. The website also frequently opposes political correctness in identifying transgender persons, such as this [To Avoid Being “Hurtful” to Trans Community, Police Fail to Provide Description of Wanted Sexual Assailant.](https://www.womenarehuman.com/to-avoid-being-hurtful-to-trans-community-police-fail-to-provide-description-of-wanted-sexual-assailant/) This story is also properly sourced.
When not reporting crimes and perceived atrocities by Transgender men, they provide opinion articles that utilize highly charged emotional language, such as this
[Dystopian Toronto: Trans Activist Mob Fights to Crush Women’s Voices.](https://www.womenarehuman.com/dystopian-toronto-trans-activist-mob-fights-to-crush-womens-voices/) Politically, Women are Human and closely align with the right based on advocating for [limited rights](https://www.womenarehuman.com/hungarys-parliament-votes-to-define-sex-as-biological-ending-legal-recognition-of-transgender-identities/) for Transgender persons. In general, Women are Human properly source information and report factually. However, the story selection and consistent anti-transgender advocacy render them Questionable as the perspective is 100% one-sided, which amounts to propaganda.
