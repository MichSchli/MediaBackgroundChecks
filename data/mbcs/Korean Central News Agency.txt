Analysis / Bias
Reporters Without Borders ranks
[North Korea ](https://rsf.org/en/north-korea)180 out of 180 in the 2022 World Press Freedom Index (last place), and according to a [Mic article](https://mic.com/articles/131947/5-of-the-boldest-claims-made-by-north-korea-s-state-media-kcna#.0LmcpftbF): “The KCNA has reported that North Korea’s former leader, Kim Jong Il, was beloved worldwide and that North Korea is the envy of the world.” Further, they report that “North Koreans are also told that Kim is a style icon and that he invented the hamburger” and “The KNCA reported that North Korea won the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Spain won that year.”
In review, most of The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) content is dedicated to the activities of
[Kim Jong-un](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un), such as [“Kim Jong Un Praised in Nepal”](http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this) and typically, they use emotionally loaded language and publish poorly sourced articles such as this one: [“U.S. Aegis Destroyer Deployed around Korean Peninsula.”](http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this) In this article, they source their claim with a vague statement without a link or a source’s name: “Foreign press says that the U.S. deployment of the destroyer is aimed to intensify military pressure upon the DPRK.”
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) employs negative language toward the nations that are seen as critical of North Korea, such as in this quote: “The article, authored by the notorious reptile journalist, is run through with lies told by the scum of society, and it was carried by the Tokyo head office of the newspaper.”
Failed Fact Checks
- The media of North Korea only reports favorably on the state. Period.
