History
[Founded in 2018](https://whois.domaintools.com/deepstatejournal.com), Deep State Journal is a strong right-leaning news and opinion website. The website lacks transparency as there isn’t an about page, authors listed on news stories, and no mention of an owner. There aren’t any names associated with the website.

Funded by / Ownership

Analysis / Bias
In review, Deep State Journal publishes news and opinions with an extreme right-wing bias. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left by using loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Dr. Fauci Was Left Grinning Ear to Ear After Joe Biden Made One Sick Prediction](https://deepstatejournal.com/2022/06/24/dr-fauci-was-left-grinning-ear-to-ear-after-joe-biden-made-one-sick-prediction/). The article itself also contains significant loaded quotes such as this: “And Fauci’s fanatics relish the thought of more government crackdowns to come.” Another example of highly loaded wording is [AOC Calls for Shocking ‘Consequences’ for Supreme Court After Roe Overturned](https://deepstatejournal.com/2022/06/28/aoc-calls-for-shocking-consequences-for-supreme-court-after-roe-overturned/). Like most on the website, this story either does not provide hyperlinked sourcing or is linked to the Questionable [Great American Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/great-american-daily/).
Finally, Deep State Journal promotes conspiracy theories such as those from
[Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/), who claims the [FBI was responsible for inciting the Capital Riots](https://deepstatejournal.com/2021/06/18/tucker-carlson-just-said-the-one-thing-that-could-end-him/). In general, this is an extremely right-biased propaganda website.
