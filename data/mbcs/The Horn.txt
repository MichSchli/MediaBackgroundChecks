History
[Founded in 2015](http://whois.domaintools.com/thehornnews.com), The Horn News is a news and opinion blog with a strong conservative bias. According to their [about page](https://thehornnews.com/about-us/) “The Horn News is direct, honest, conservative — and often outspoken. But we’re never dull, and we’re not afraid to take on the mainstream media’s “fake news” spin.” They list their associate publisher as “Stephen Dietrich, an outspoken conservative and decorated veteran of the war in Iraq.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the blog does not publish original news but rather utilizes other sources of news and offers opinions that generally favor the right. Most stories serve as propaganda for the former Trump administration, such as this
[Trump announces his greatest accomplishment](https://thehornnews.com/trump-announces-his-greatest-accomplishment/). In fact, it is not possible to find criticism of Trump on this blog.
However, there is the frequent denigration of liberals, such as this
[Hillary Clinton emerges from hiding, report says](https://thehornnews.com/hillary-clinton-emerges-from-hiding-report-says/). This story is sourced to tweets only. Regarding sourcing, The Horn News occasionally sources credible outlets such as [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), but more frequently sources poor far-right sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). In general, The Horn News is an extreme right-wing biased source that does not always publish factual news.
