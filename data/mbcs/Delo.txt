Analysis / Bias
The current prime minister of Slovenia is
[Janez Janša](https://apnews.com/f128a2a9413d24cd2f550f8ea129face); he is also the nationalist, right-wing populist Slovenian Democratic Party (SDP) leader. Janez Janša is known to use social media to attack critics, such as Slovenian public broadcaster [Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTVS)](https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/detail-alert?p_p_id=sojdashboard_WAR_coesojportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-3&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=11&_sojdashboard_WAR_coesojportlet_alertPK=62377374&_sojdashboard_WAR_coesojportlet_displayLink=SojPortlet.getDashboardPortletId%28%29), and calling critical journalists [“Presstitutes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/janez-jansa-new-pm-slovenia-in-mould-of-orban).”
DW
[reports](https://www.dw.com/en/slovenian-press-freedom-is-suffering-journalists-say/a-3085350) a Delo journalist critical of the Janez Janša Government was “fired shortly after he wrote commentary critical of his government’s foreign policy.” Further, OSCE [reports](https://www.osce.org/fom/125386) an investigative journalist from Delo, Anuška Delič, was prosecuted for publishing classified information, which poses a threat to free media.
When reporting on politics Delo generally presents news with balance, such as
[”Janša confirmed the introduction of free transport for pensioners from 1 July”](https://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/varda-meje-mediji-poslanci-zacenjajo-junijsko-sejo-z-vprasanji-jansi-in-vladi-319856.html). They also use moderately loaded language such as this: [“The government report on the purchase of protective equipment directly attacks Marjan Šarc](https://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/vlada-le-objavila-porocilo-o-nabavi-zascitne-opreme-kaj-razkriva-306317.html).” On issues such as immigration, they publish articles with a neutral tone, [“A set of measures to manage migration”.](https://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/nabor-ukrepov-za-upravljanje-migracij-200090.html)
When it comes to sourcing, they rarely use hyperlinks, but when they do, they source government sites such as
[gov.si](https://www.gov.si/) and offer quotations from credible sources such as [Die Welt.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/die-welt/) World news coverage about the USA is critical of former President Donald Trump: [“Because of Trump, they had to destroy part of the cotton swabs produced.”](https://www.delo.si/novice/svet/zaradi-trumpa-so-morali-uniciti-del-proizvedenih-vatnih-palck-317383.html)
Editorially, they cover a variety of perspectives; however, more stories favor the left, such as this supporting racial justice:
[In a circle of violence](https://www.delo.si/mnenja/kolumne/v-krogu-nasilja-318576.html) and this proclaiming the need for social justice for the elderly who are victims of violence: [Family old hatred](https://www.delo.si/mnenja/komentarji/druzinsko-staromrznistvo-319497.html). Finally, when reporting on political issues, they promote [LGBTQ rights](https://www.delo.si/novice/svet/hrvasko-ustavno-sodisce-istospolnim-parom-prisodilo-pravico-do-rejnistva-277380.html) and concern for [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). In general, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
