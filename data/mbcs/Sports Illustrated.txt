Analysis / Bias
Sports Illustrated’s primary focus is sports news and analysis, with occasional sports-related political stories.
In review, SI publishes articles with neutral language, such as “
[NFL Power Rankings: Jets in Top Five After Free Agency With Aaron Rodgers Coming Soon,”](https://www.si.com/nfl/2023/03/20/nfl-power-rankings-free-agency-jets-aaron-rodgers) and expresses left-leaning opinions within the context of sports, such as [“Trump’s Agenda Isn’t the NFL or NBA. It’s Trump, As Always](https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/09/25/colin-kaepernick-donald-trump-nfl-anthem-protests-teresa-kaepernick),” [“Is the NFL Ready for Donald Trump’s Return?”](https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/07/28/is-the-nfl-ready-for-donald-trumps-return-daily-cover) The article cites Governor Ron DeSantis’s “battle” with Disney over Florida’s controversial education bill, seen as a culture war issue and linked to Trumpian-style politics.
The article states, “Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is battling the Disney corporation (firmly in bed with the NFL as a content partner and owner of
[ESPN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/espn/)) over its opposition to the state’s Parental Rights In Education—or ‘Don’t Say Gay’—bill, in what is largely a culture war meant to appease voters in a Trumpian style.”
Another article, “
[What Do You Think of Colin Kaepernick Now?](https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/06/01/colin-kaepernick-and-george-floyd-protests)” highlights the athletes speaking out against racial injustice. The quote reads, “All Kaepernick wanted was justice and his job. The first is hard to achieve. The second, he never should have lost.”
SI utilizes credible sources such as
[Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), [ESPN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/espn/), and flsenate.gov. In general, Sports Illustrated is fact-based and holds left-leaning editorial positions.
