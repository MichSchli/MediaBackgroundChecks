Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, Florida Phoenix is part of
[States Newsroom](https://statesnewsroom.com/about/), a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit [supported by grants and a coalition of donors and readers](https://statesnewsroom.com/support/). States Newsroom publishes 28 other [publications](https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/). The Florida Phoenix is transparent as they link to the States Newsroom donors page. Initially, when they launched, they got fiscal sponsorship from the Hopewell Foundation; however, once the IRS approved their application for 501(c)(3) charity certification, they severed their ties with Hopewell Foundation. There has been criticism of their involvement with [the Hopewell Foundation,](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/mysterious-funders-behind-new-arizona-media-outlet-10870282) and they have responded to the criticism [here](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/a-few-friday-thoughts-on-what-the-arizona-mirror-is-and-isnt/).
Analysis / Bias
The Florida Phoenix publishes original news reporting on politics and policy from Florida. Coverage focuses on the legislature, the environment, and how national policy affects Floridians. Articles and headlines promote liberal perspectives through moderate, loaded language
[Voters this year will decide whether Florida Supreme Court justices stay or go](https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/10/31/voters-this-year-will-decide-whether-florida-supreme-court-justices-stay-or-go/)
They properly source, linking to the Florida Legislature and credible sources such as
[whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Center for Responsive Politics (Open Secrets)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), and bls.gov (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Editorially, opinion pieces favor the left, such as this
[The AR-15 is for mass killing — ban it | Opinion](https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/06/01/the-ar-15-is-for-mass-killing-ban-it-opinion/) On the issues, Florida Phoenix promotes LGBT equality and has concerns about climate change. Finally, they frequently report negatively on Republican politicians, such as this [FL Dems denounce leaked abortion opinion; GOP denounces the leak itself](https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/05/03/fl-dems-denounce-leaked-abortion-opinion-gop-denounces-the-leak-itself/). In general, the Florida Phoenix reports news factually; however, story selection and op-eds strongly favor a liberal perspective.
