Analysis / Bias
In review, One Angry Gamer publishes news, reviews, and opinions on video games and the associated culture. The website features a tagline, “Delivering Gaming News Without Remorse.” Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded language such as this
[CLIFFY B REGRETS MAKING LAWBREAKERS GET WOKE AND GO BROKE](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2020/02/cliffy-b-regrets-making-lawbreakers-get-woke-and-go-broke/102439/), and this [TWITTER SUSPENDS USER FOR USING “THOT” BECAUSE IT’S “HATEFUL CONDUCT](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2020/02/twitter-suspends-user-for-using-thot-because-its-hateful-conduct/102349/).” The website also covers political news typically concerned with censorship and harshly criticizes Social Justice Warriors (i.e., left). For example, in the article [SLEEPING GIANTS CONTINUES QUEST TO DEPLATFORM ONE ANGRY GAMER, GATEWAY PUNDIT](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2020/02/sleeping-giants-continues-quest-to-deplatform-one-angry-gamer-gateway-pundit/102492/), they state, “Basically, if you don’t kowtow to the Regressive Left’s ideology, then they make sure that you won’t have a platform to share any opinions they don’t like.” Further, [searching](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/?s=sjw) for the term SJW (Social Justice Warrior), you find numerous stories railing against what they perceive as SJWs, such as this: [CRAZY SJWS TARGET HERO HEI FOR CRITICIZING TEMTEM’S PRONOUNS](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2020/01/crazy-sjws-false-flag-hero-heis-video-for-criticizing-temtems-pronouns/101999/).
Editorially, One Angry Gamer can only be described as far-right or alt-right, with numerous examples of derogatory wording toward the left. As stated above, there is an intense preoccupation with so-called Social Justice Warriors. For instance, they have criticized video game creators for strong feminist characters and LGBTQ characters, such as this:
