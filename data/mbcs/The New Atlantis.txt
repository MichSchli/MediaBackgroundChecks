Analysis / Bias
The primary focus of The New Atlantis is Bioethics, concerning such issues as Stem Cell Research, Cloning, Assisted Suicide, among many others. They also report libertarian views about human enhancement and
[transhumanism](http://futurisms.thenewatlantis.com/2010/06/why-transhumanism-wont-work.html); its contributors generally tend to question whether technologies like artificial intelligence, “friendly” artificial intelligence, and genetic enhancement are positive.
Rather than this being a Pro-Science source, it is more opinion-based, although it is extremely well-sourced to mostly credible scientific information. The articles are very well written and present both sides of viewpoints; however, the general political affiliation of the publisher and the content is strongly right-center.
