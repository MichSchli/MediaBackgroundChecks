Analysis / Bias
In review, AFP has
[advocated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_for_Prosperity#cite_note-6) for opposition to Obama administration initiatives such as global warming regulation, the Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act, the expansion of Medicaid, and economic stimulus. It helped turn back cap and trade, the major environmental proposal of Obama’s first term. AFP advocated for limits on the collective bargaining rights of public-sector trade unions and right-to-work laws, and it opposed raising the federal minimum wage.
The Americans for Prosperity website features sections such as “Latest Actions,” highlighting their advocacy. There is also a section called “Our Focus,” which highlights news by AFP such as this:
[NEW REPORT: The Right Way to Stop Government Shutdowns and Budgeting by Crisis](https://americansforprosperity.org/new-report-the-right-way-to-stop-government-shutdowns-and-budgeting-by-crisis/). Finally, they offer a section called “Newsroom,” which publishes right-leaning news stories such as this: [Congress, stop budgeting by crisis](https://americansforprosperity.org/congress-stop-budgeting-by-crisis/). This story is properly sourced to [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/).
Editorially, AFP supports a Libertarian/Conservative Republican perspective. For example, with climate change, they support a free-market approach while not denying that
[global warming](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is human-influenced, [Five Myths About the Latest Carbon Tax Proposal](https://americansforprosperity.org/five-myths-about-the-latest-carbon-tax-proposal/). When covering President Trump, they often agree with his policies; however, they also criticize the President when they disagree: [AFP Urges Trump Administration to Stop Escalating Trade War](https://americansforprosperity.org/afp-urges-trump-administration-to-stop-escalating-trade-war/). In general, AFP supports free-market Libertarian principles but often fails fact checks due to their political ads.
