History
The Tax Policy Center (TPC) is a
[nonpartisan think tank based](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/about) in Washington, D.C. A joint venture of the [Urban Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/urban-institute/) and the [Brookings Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/), it aims to provide independent analyses of current and longer-term tax issues and communicate its analyses to the public and policymakers. TPC combines national specialists in tax, expenditure, budget policy, and microsimulation modeling to concentrate on five overarching areas of tax policy: fair, simple, and efficient taxation, social policy in the tax code, business tax reform, long-term implications of tax and budget choices, and state tax issues.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Tax Policy Center uses minimal loaded emotional wording in their research and is minimally biased. All analysis is factually sourced to credible sources of information. The TPC also has a blog that has a left-leaning bias in story selection and wording. The blog is also properly sourced, and there isn’t evidence of any failed fact checks. When reporting on Tax issues, it is generally supportive of Democratic measures such as this
[What Is Biden’s Minimum Book Income Tax on Corporations?](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/what-bidens-minimum-book-income-tax-corporations)
When reporting on Republican tax plans, they tend to have a more negative tone, such as this
[A Big Error in the Senate Republicans’ Balanced Budget Amendment](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/big-error-senate-republicans-balanced-budget-amendment). This story is properly sourced, as are most on the website. In general, all information presented is factual and rooted in fact; however, there is a clear left-leaning economic bias with what they view as positive and negative.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years. The Tax Policy Center is used as a resource by left-leaning IFCN fact-checkers.
