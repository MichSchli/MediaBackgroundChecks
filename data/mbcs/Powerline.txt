Analysis / Bias
Power Line often vigorously criticizes Democrats and liberals for dishonesty, lack of morals, bad judgment, and disloyalty to the United States. Headlines and articles often contain strongly loaded language that favors the right, such as this:
[THE DEMS’ APOCALYPSE PRIMARY](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/03/the-dems-apocalypse-primary.php) and [END OF THE MUELLER AFFAIR](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/03/end-of-the-mueller-affair.php). Both of these stories are properly sourced. When it comes to science, Power Line takes a denialist’s view on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), with articles such as this: [CLIMATE CHANGE ALARMISM IS FOUNDED ON DISHONESTY](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/11/climate-change-alarmism-is-founded-on-dishonesty.php). This article is sourced to the [No Tricks Zone](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/notrickszone/), which is a human-influenced climate science denial website.
On the sidebar of the website, Power Line lists their favorite sources, which consists of all right-leaning sources and several we have rated as questionable, such as the
[American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/) and Michelle Malkin. Further, after the 2020 election, this source advanced conspiracy theories regarding a “stolen election” and Covid-19 misinformation. In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left.
