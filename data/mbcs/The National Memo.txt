Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Memo publishes news and opinion geared toward a progressive liberal audience. There is often use of moderately loaded emotional language in headlines and articles such as this:
[Mitch McConnell Piously Urges ‘Civility’ In Politics](https://www.nationalmemo.com/mitch-mcconnell-piously-urges-civility-in-politics/). This article is republished from the [American Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-independent-institute/) Institute, which we have rated left-biased. In another article that demonstrates loaded emotional language, [Sean Spicer Is Still Defending The Indefensible](https://www.nationalmemo.com/sean-spicer-is-still-defending-the-indefensible/); there is a complete lack of sourcing. Therefore, National Memo sometimes sources information properly, but not in every article.
Editorially, all stories favor the left and often denigrate the right such as this:
[Conservatives May Soon Run Out Of Values To Defile](https://www.nationalmemo.com/conservatives-may-soon-run-out-of-values-to-defile/). Generally, stories are fact-based and mostly sourced properly; however, not always, while editorial positions always favor the left.
