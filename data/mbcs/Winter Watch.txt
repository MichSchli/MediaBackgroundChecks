Analysis / Bias
Winterwatch is a right-wing blog that posts conspiracy theories about
[Joe Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/facts-and-bias-joe-biden/), such as claiming this video of Biden is a deep fake or uses a body double. [Is Biden in Deepfake Mode?](https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/08/is-biden-in-deepfake-mode/) [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) has written a thorough [debunking](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2NC1U8) of these claims.
Some articles are anti-Semitic as the site has a tag section on Jewish power and influence found here
[https://www.winterwatch.net/tag/jewish-power-influence/](https://www.winterwatch.net/tag/jewish-power-influence/).
The Pizzagate theory gets several articles like
[The DC Pizzagate Unfolds: Pedophile Scandal Brewing](https://www.winterwatch.net/2016/11/election-day-wrap-up/). This theory was found to be [false](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/09/fact-check-pizzagate-is-not-real.html).
For sourcing, most links are internal and merely link back to the article being read rather than linking to external evidence. In general, Winter Watch is a far-right biased blog that consistently promotes false information and conspiracy theories.
