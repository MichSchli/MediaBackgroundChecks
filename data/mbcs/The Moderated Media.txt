Analysis / Bias
In review, The Moderated Media breaks down news into the columns Left and Right. Each column presents news stories that opens to the source from which they came. Some sources found in the left column are the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [The New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/) and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). In the right column you will find [The Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) and [Town Hall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/). While the Moderated Media is clearly trying to cover both sides, some of the sources used have Mixed Factual ratings such as [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) and [Newsmax,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax/) as well some that are on our Questionable list such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and the [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/). The Moderated Media also has a category for [fact checking](https://www.themoderatedmedia.com/fact-checks/) that does not exclusively use [IFCN fact checkers](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/).
