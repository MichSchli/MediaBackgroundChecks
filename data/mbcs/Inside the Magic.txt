History
[Inside the Magic (ITM)](https://insidethemagic.net/about/) was a Disney fan site launched by [Ricky Brigante](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/arts/longtime-local-theme-park-observer-ricky-brigante-sells-his-pioneering-inside-the-magic-website-11650551) in 2005. In 2018, it was acquired by Kurt Schmidt and features content from its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@InsideTheMagic/videos) covering theme parks, movies, TV, video games, conventions, and special events. Inside the Magic (ITM) is headquartered in Bay Lake, Florida. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

While Inside the Magic (ITM) lists
[JAK Schmidt, Inc.](https://insidethemagic.net/privacy-policy/) as the copyright holder at the bottom of their website, detailed information about this entity is not readily available. Previously, [Kurt Schmidt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtisschmidt/) was known to be associated with ITM, as indicated on his LinkedIn profile. However, the current specifics of the ownership structure remain unclear. The site’s revenue primarily comes from advertising, partnerships, sponsorships, YouTube channel ads, and a shop that sells branded merchandise.
Analysis / Bias
Inside the Magic publishes tabloid-style articles, such as “
[Kylie Jenner Gets Major Backlash From Fans for Disney Stunt,](https://insidethemagic.net/2021/11/kylie-jenner-backlash-disney-stunt-mc1/)” which focuses on high-profile celebrities involved in controversial incidents at Disney. This aligns with the type of content often seen in tabloids.
Another article, “
[Florida GOP Shoots Down Plans To Return DeSantis District to Disney,”](https://insidethemagic.net/2024/01/florida-gop-shoots-down-plans-return-desantis-district-disney-nk1/) covers a political issue involving [Florida Governor Ron DeSantis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-political-bias-profile/) and the Disney corporation. It cites the composition of the Florida House and includes statements from political figures. While the article provides specific legislative details, its tone and framing lean towards sensationalism, further evidenced by its use of imagery (e.g., ‘Ron DeSantis laughing at Disney World’).
Regarding sourcing, ITM often uses circular referencing by citing other articles from their site and a mix of sources such as
[Justia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/justia-bias/), [flsenate.gov](https://www.flsenate.gov/), TikTok, and [Vanity Fair](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vanity-fair/).
In addition, we analyzed headlines for
[President Joe Biden](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and [Former President Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). Both contained sensationalism and clickbait elements. This approach attracts readers’ attention and encourages clicks, regardless of the political figure involved. For instance, some headlines about Joe Biden read as follows: [“Joe Biden Calls Republicans “Crazy” Over Disney Attacks, “They’re Going to Storm Cinderella’s Castle,”](https://insidethemagic.net/2022/05/disney-conservatives-joe-biden-reedy-creek-battle-mocks-ld1/) and [“Biden Mocks DeSantis Over Ongoing Disney Feud.”](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/04/biden-mocks-desantis-over-ongoing-disney-feud-cj1/) These headlines use sensational language like “Crazy,” and “Mocks” to exaggerate Biden’s interactions or comments concerning Disney and political opponents.
Here are a few examples of headlines about Donald Trump:
[“Move Over, DeSantis: Trump Takes “Woke” Potshots at Disney”](https://insidethemagic.net/2023/11/trump-desantis-attacks-woke-disney-nk1/) and [“Trump Causes Havoc at Disney, Guest Shares “Cringeworthy” Experience.”](https://insidethemagic.net/2022/11/disney-world-trump-issue-cringeworthy-experience-ld1/) Here, the use of terms like “Woke Potshots” and “Causes Havoc” creates a dramatic and sensational narrative around Trump’s actions and statements.
In both cases, Inside the Magic employs a style that leans towards sensationalism and clickbait, using emotionally loaded or provocative language to draw in readers, a common tactic in tabloid journalism to boost engagement and traffic. This editorial choice focuses on the attention-grabbing aspects of news reporting rather than a straightforward presentation of information. Generally, Inside the Magic produces more sensational or click-worthy content to attract views, often prioritizing traffic over factual accuracy, as evidenced by numerous failed fact checks.
