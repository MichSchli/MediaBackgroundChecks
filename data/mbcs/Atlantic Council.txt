History
The Atlantic Council is a think tank in the field of international affairs. Founded in 1961, it provides a forum for international political, business, and intellectual leaders. It manages ten regional centers and functional programs related to international security and global economic prosperity. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.
The Atlantic Council was founded with the stated mission to encourage the continuation of cooperation between North America and Europe that began after World War II (Atlanticism). The current President and CEO is

This was produced in response to a perceived movement toward more authoritarianism by western democracies; the declaration was signed by scores of former government officials and other experts.
