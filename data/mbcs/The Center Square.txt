History
The Center Square, formerly watchdog.org, is a network of American news websites that features reporting on state and local government from a conservative perspective. It is a project of the
[Franklin News Foundation](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/franklin-center-for-government-and-public-integrity/), an online news organization. According to their [about page](https://www.thecentersquare.com/site/about/about.html), “The focus of our work is state- and local-level government and economic reporting. A taxpayer sensibility distinguishes our work from other coverage of state and local issues. As a result of this approach, our readers are better informed about the focus of state and local government and its cost to the citizens whose tax dollars fund governmental decisions.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Center Square is owned and published by the Franklin News Foundation, a nonprofit funded through donations. In the past, funding came from
[Donor’s Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donors_Trust) and [Donors Capital Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donors_Capital_Fund). However, at present, they lack transparency and do not clearly list how they are funded.
