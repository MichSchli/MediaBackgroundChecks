The Co-Founders of the website are Ty and Charlene Bollinger, neither of which have a degree, expertise, or work experience related to cancer and its treatment. According to their
[mission statement](https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/), they “wish to end cancer.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Truth About Cancer is a website that promotes al
[ternative cures for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) as well as prevention, all of which are considered pseudoscience. They also promote false information on Covid-19, such as this: [8 “Facts” About Coronavirus That Are Actually Lies](https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/8-facts-actually-lies/). Most of these facts have been debunked, and further, the sources primarily come from those who support former President Trump.
When it comes to cancer, they promote unproven and dangerous remedies such as Gerson Therapy, which is essentially a coffee enema. Yes, you read that correctly. See here:
[How to Use Coffee Enemas to Detoxify & Heal from Cancer](https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/coffee-enemas-detoxify-heal-cancer/). Finally, they routinely [promote](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/no-bill-gates-is-not-funding-covid-19-vaccines-as-a-way-to-conduct-global-surveillance-or-to-depopulate-the-world/) right-leaning conspiracies such as those related to [vaccinations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and Bill Gates. There are too many ineffective and dangerous remedies to list here. Be assured they will neither work nor, in some cases, be safe!
