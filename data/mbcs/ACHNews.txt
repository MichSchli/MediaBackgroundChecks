Analysis / Bias
In review, ACHNews is the personal blog of Annie from North Carolina, that primarily publishes news on environmental and wildlife issues. Headlines are not sensationalized and reflect the content of the story such as this:
[Congress overturns bill and makes the hunting of hibernating bears and denned wolves legal](https://achnews.org/2019/11/30/congress-overturns-bill-and-makes-the-hunting-of-hibernating-bears-and-denned-wolves-legal/). This story is appropriately sourced to the Humane Society, [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) and the [Huff Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/).
Editorially, story selection favors the left through the promotion of environmental awareness such as this:
[Taylor Energy has Been Leaking up to 30,000 Gallons of Oil a Day for 15 Years and Now Wants to Walk Away](https://achnews.org/2019/10/04/taylor-energy-has-been-leaking-up-to-30000-gallons-of-oil-a-day-for-15-years-and-now-wants-to-walk-away/). This story, like all others reviewed, is properly sourced. Politically, ACHNews frequently reports negatively on the Trump Administration’s environmental positions: [Top USDA Scientist Quits, Claiming that the Trump Administration Tried to Bury His Climate Change Study](https://achnews.org/2019/08/08/top-usda-scientist-quits-claiming-that-the-trump-administration-tried-to-bury-his-climate-change-study/). In general, ACHNews publishes factual information with proper sourcing and a left-leaning editorial bias.
