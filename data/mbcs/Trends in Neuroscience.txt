[Predatory journals](https://predatoryjournals.com/about/) often lack peer review and are generally considered not credible. The Trends in Neurosciences is considered a [legitimate, open-access publisher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017830/) that is frequently indexed in [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/). However, Cell Press has been criticized for [retracting some studies.](https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-journal/cell/)
Although Cell Press has retracted some studies in other publications, Trends in Neurosciences publishes credible scientific studies that are factual and appropriately peer-reviewed.
