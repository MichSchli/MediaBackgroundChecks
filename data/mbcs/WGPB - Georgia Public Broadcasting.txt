Analysis / Bias
In review, the WGPB – Georgia Public Broadcasting website reports news and radio programming information with a slight liberal bias. News on the website is derived from
[NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) and often utilizes minimally loaded language, such as this [Judge rules against environmental group’s attempt to stop construction of police training facility](https://www.gpb.org/news/2024/01/19/judge-rules-against-environmental-groups-attempt-stop-construction-of-police). This story is fact-based and, like all others reviewed, relies on credible sources of information. The website also publishes content from [American Public Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-public-media/) and the [Corporation for Public Broadcasting](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs-news-hour/).
In general, story selection tends to lean slightly left, as does editorial content, such as this:
[Celebrating Transgender Awareness Week In Georgia](https://www.gpb.org/news/2018/11/19/celebrating-transgender-awareness-week-in-georgia). Finally, news reporting is fact-based and leans left from an editorial perspective.
