History
Founded in 2009, The European Union Times is a far-right conspiracy website that does not always publish factual news. According to their
[about page](https://www.eutimes.net/about/) the “European Union Times is an international newspaper based in Europe with operational branches in the Netherlands, Poland, Italy, Russia, the United States of America and Canada.”
They also proclaim their
[ideology](https://www.eutimes.net/about/), which can best be described as some hybrid form of Nazism “To make things clear, we DO endorse [communism in its original Soviet Union form](https://www.eutimes.net/2018/11/are-antifa-anarchists-really-communists-or-just-satanists/), we disavow Antifa as not real communists but as a bunch of Satanist schizophrenics who should all be sent to the Siberian gulags. We also support nationalism! We are both socialists and nationalists. Had the Axis and the USSR got along back in the 40s as they should have, the world would have been a totally different place now (for the good).”
The EU Times lacks transparency as they do not list names associated with the website, nor authors or owners.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The EU Times publishes news and opinions from a far-right nationalist perspective. They often use loaded language that frequently denigrates minorities, immigrants, and liberals, such as this:
[Somali migrant brutally rapes Hungarian girl in a Budapest park, saved by American](https://www.eutimes.net/2020/01/somali-migrant-brutally-rapes-hungarian-girl-in-a-budapest-park-saved-by-american/). When not promoting hate they often publish right-wing conspiracy theories such as this about George Soros: [Swedish-Palestinian Journalist Dies Just Before He Exposes Soros And Aschberg](https://www.eutimes.net/2020/01/swedish-palestinian-journalist-dies-just-before-he-exposes-soros-and-aschberg/). This story is sourced to the Questionable Russian propaganda site [Russia Insider.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-insider/)
Further, they published a fake news story regarding the Corona Virus:
[Romania develops Coronavirus Vaccine able to Cure White People only](https://www.eutimes.net/2020/01/romania-develops-coronavirus-vaccine-able-to-cure-white-people-only/). Needless to say, this is [not true](https://hoax--alert-leadstories-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/hoax-alert.leadstories.com/amp-3471563-fake-news-romania-has-not-developed-coronavirus-vaccine-able-to-cure-white-people-only.html?amp_js_v=0.1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D). In general, The EU Times is a far-right biased website that promotes conspiracy theories and hate.
