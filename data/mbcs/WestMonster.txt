Analysis / Bias
In review, WestMonster is a strongly right learning news website that favors Brexit and has connections to both the Conservative Party and the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Articles typically contain loaded emotional headlines such as this:
[Jailed Peterborough MP ‘could leave prison today under early release scheme’](https://www.westmonster.com/jailed-peterborough-mp-could-leave-prison-today-under-early-release-scheme/). This article sources to the Questionable [Daily Mail,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) which has a terrible track record with fact-checking and sensationalism. WestMonster holds [anti-immigration](https://www.westmonster.com/category/immigration/) positions as well as [anti-EU](https://www.westmonster.com/eurosceptics-on-course-to-win-more-than-a-third-of-seats-in-eu-parliament/) sentiments. WestMonster also holds a [favorable opinion](https://www.westmonster.com/trump-mays-deal-sounds-great-for-eu/) of Donald Trump. In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the Labor Party (Left). Although they primarily link to credible known sources, they sometimes use sources that are strongly right biased, or Questionable.
