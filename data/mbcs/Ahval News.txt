Analysis / Bias
[Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan) is the president of Turkey. He is the Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader, which is the ruling conservative political party in Turkey.
According to
[freedomhouse.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/freedom-house/), Ahval news has been [blocked](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/turkey) in Turkey by The Turkish Telecommunications Authority (BTK) (Turkey’s Internet watchdog). Ahval news has also been [criticized](https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2017/12/06/uaes-unending-turkey-war-now-the-zarrab-case-and-ahval-news) as being close to or linked to U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen by the pro-government Turkish daily [Sabah.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-sabah/)
In review, Ahval News publishes articles critical of the Erdogan government with emotionally loaded language such as
[“Erdoğan’s dictatorship driving Turkey toward dead end”](https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-local-elections/erdogans-dictatorship-driving-turkey-toward-dead-end-editorial) and [“A dangerous vortex in Turkey.”](https://ahvalnews.com/erdogan/dangerous-vortex-turkey) When it comes to sourcing, Ahval News often hyperlinks to itself and credible sources such as [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Portland Press Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/portland-press-herald/), [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/), and factually mixed sources such as [Newsweek.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone, such as in this article [“Trump’s Turkey ties show broader pattern of abuses of power – senator](https://ahvalnews.com/trump-erdogan/trumps-turkey-ties-show-broader-pattern-abuses-power-senator).” In general, their reports are rooted in fact; however, they have a very strong anti-Erdogan bias that has been described as [counter-propaganda](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/12/turkey-uae-conflit-may-spillover-into-gulf.html).
