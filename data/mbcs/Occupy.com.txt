Analysis / Bias
In review, Occupy.com publishes news related to economic, environmental, and social justice. Occupy.com both republishes articles from left-leaning media sources such as
[Salon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/) and [Common Dreams,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/common-dreams/) as well as producing original content. In reviewing the original content, there is the moderate use of loaded language in the headlines such as this: [UN POVERTY REPORT HIGHLIGHTS BRITISH GOVERNMENT’S ROLE FUELLING INEQUALITY.](https://www.occupy.com/article/un-poverty-report-highlights-british-government-s-role-fuelling-inequality#sthash.ETTere1o.dpbs) This story is properly sourced to credible media outlets. In fact, all of the original articles reviewed were properly sourced to left-leaning sources or .org’s.
In general, story selection favors the left with a focus on the issues of
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), the police state, the corporate state, and social injustice.
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=occupy.com&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals that Occupy.com has not failed a fact check. Do not confuse this website with [Occupy Democrats](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/occupy-democrats/), which is a [questionable source](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/) that has failed numerous fact-checks.
