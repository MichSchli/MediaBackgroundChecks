[Tony Robbins](https://www.seekr.com/press-center). The mission of Seekr is to “combat misinformation, clickbait, and increase media literacy.” Ironically, Tony Robbins, a life and business strategist, has made [false claims](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/tony-robbins-covid-19-death-toll-claims-are-fatally-flawed/), promoted misinformation, and has been involved in [controversies](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tony-robbins-accused-sexual-misconduct-berating-abuse-victims-n1007041). The current CEO is [Pat Condo](https://www.seekr.com/about), who was CEO and Chairman of NTENT and the founder and CEO of NASDAQ-listed search companies, Excalibur Technologies and Convera Corporation.

Analysis / Bias
Seekr.com aggregates news stories from other sources and rates them using AI on a bias scale nearly identical to Media Bias Fact Check: Left, Left-Center, Center, Right-Center and Right. They also rate reliability with a similar scale as MBFC: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High. The reader can select which bias and credibility level to filter news on the website.
Seekr
[claims](https://www.seekr.com/seekr-score) to use AI’s natural language processing to rate individual news stories with their unique Seekr Score. They further state, “We use data scientists and a diverse range of expert journalists who train models to recognize specific Score Factors: Subjectivity, Personal Attack, Clickbait, Title Exaggeration, and the Presence/Absence of a Byline.”
A review of news stories and scoring shows that sometimes it is accurate. For example, this story from the
[ New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/) [Russian missile attack on Dnipro, Ukraine kills 2-year-old girl, injures 22](https://nypost.com/2023/06/04/russian-missile-attack-on-dnipro-kills-2-year-old-injures-22/) is accurately assigned a Very High Seekr reliability score. This is evidenced as the event did happen, and several news agencies reported it. However, another story by the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) is inaccurate as they claim it has low reliability: [3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Rare Attack on Egyptian ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/03/world/middleeast/israel-egypt-border-shootings.html)Border. This is false, as the event did occur and was reported by [numerous outlets](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/two-wounded-security-incident-along-israel-egypt-border-israeli-media-2023-06-03/) such as [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/two-wounded-security-incident-along-israel-egypt-border-israeli-media-2023-06-03/).
Because many ratings were found to be inaccurate, it is difficult to determine bias on this website. There are instances of left-leaning articles being rated right and vice-versa. We assign this site a least biased rating but rate them as Questionable due to a lack of transparency with funding and evidence of mislabeled news stories.
