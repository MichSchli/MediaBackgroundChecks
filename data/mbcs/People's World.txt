Analysis / Bias
Upon review, People’s World uses emotionally loaded language, such as in the article titled
[‘Carbon capture pipelines: Climate solution or catastrophe waiting to happen?’](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/carbon-capture-pipelines-climate-solution-or-catastrophe-waiting-to-happen/) In the article, the author critiques carbon capture technology, emphasizing its potential risks and impacts on marginalized communities. It cites an incident in Satartia, Mississippi, Food and Water Watch data, and quotes from social action groups. However, the article lacks direct hyperlinks to its sources, making it harder for readers to verify the information. The author utilizes emotionally loaded language within the article, as in statements like “Technology like CCUS exemplifies the ‘climate plan’ greenwashing tactics used by the capitalist class.”
Another article titled
[‘Billionaires plan more efficient world rule via new international golf monopoly”](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/billionaires-plan-more-efficient-world-rule-via-new-international-golf-monopoly/) analyzes the influence of billionaires on global governance through the context of a recent golf industry merger. The author strongly disapproves of the merger, using strong, emotionally loaded language to describe it as an “astounding display of corporate greed” and a “bloodstained monopoly.”
The article exhibits a negative bias towards the merger and the entities involved, as reflected in the author’s choice of words and overall tone. The article does not provide direct links or citations to specific sources, but independent research can be conducted to verify the mentioned entities and events. Reliable news sources offer information on the merger involving the PGA, LIV Golf, and DP World Golf, as well as insights into Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s background and actions. However, there is a lack of hyperlinks to verify information. In general, People’s World holds far-left political viewpoints and is reasonably fact-based; however, the lack of hyperlinks makes it difficult to verify the information.
