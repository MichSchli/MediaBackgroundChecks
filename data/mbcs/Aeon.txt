Analysis / Bias
In review, Aeon provides long and short-form journalism focused on science, philosophy, and culture. They also provide video documentaries. Articles and headlines often are not political and do not use loaded language such as this
[There was nothing quick about how we arrived at the standardized second](https://aeon.co/videos/there-was-nothing-quick-about-how-we-arrived-at-the-standardised-second).
Editorially, Aeon does not directly report on politics; however, they do have opinion pieces that deal with political issues, such as this one focusing on
[income inequality and mutual respect for others](https://aeon.co/essays/restoring-respect-is-the-first-step-towards-a-better-society). They also express concern for [climate change](https://aeon.co/ideas/is-there-a-limit-to-optimism-when-it-comes-to-climate-change) as well as support for [LGBTQ](https://aeon.co/essays/does-anyone-have-the-right-to-speak-on-the-behalf-of). Overall, the reporting is factual with a left-leaning editorial bias.
