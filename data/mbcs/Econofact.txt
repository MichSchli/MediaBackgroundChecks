Analysis / Bias
In review, the website has a link to the
[Econofact Network](https://econofact.org/about#network), which displays a list of economists and their writings. They also provide a search feature that allows you search economic topics such as “Carbon Tax” and see all articles related to Carbon Tax. Articles are written in a short and easy to read format that addresses an economic question with factual sourcing. There is minimal use of loaded words in most articles such as this: [Carbon Taxes: What Can We Learn From International Experience?](https://econofact.org/carbon-taxes-what-can-we-learn-from-international-experience). This article is properly sourced to credible outlets such as the [Brookings Institution](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/) and the [CBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbc-news-canadian-broadcasting/).
Editorially, Econofact does not utilize loaded words, however they do not report favorably on
[President Trump’s policy](https://econofact.org/the-mexican-border-and-u-s-trade-what-would-be-the-impact-of-a-border-closure) and its impact on the economy. This source also [supports](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) the consensus of science regarding [climate change](https://econofact.org/can-u-s-and-u-k-forest-bioenergy-subsidies-have-adverse-climate-consequences).
Failed Fact Checks
- A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#?fns.type=fact-checking&gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=econofact&gsc.sort=)reveals they have not failed a fact check but, in fact, are used as a resource by some IFCN fact-checkers.
