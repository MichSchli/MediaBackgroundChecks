History
Launched in 2015, Politico Europe is the European counterpart to the USA-based Politico.
[Politico USA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico-europe-bias/) was founded in 2007 by two former [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) Journalists, John F. Harris, and Jim VandeHei; Politico is a news and opinion website based in Virginia, USA.
In 2016,
[Jim VandeHei](https://www.wsj.com/articles/politico-ceo-reins-in-predecessors-projects-1490002200) left Politico and is now the co-founder and CEO of [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/). They describe their [vision](https://www.politico.com/about-us): “Politico strives to be the dominant source for politics and policy in power centers across every continent where access to reliable information, non-partisan journalism, and real-time tools creates, informs, and engages a global citizenry.” [Read our profile on the German government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/germany-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Politico Europe covers European Politics and policies such as climate change, economics, technology, and foreign affairs. Articles and headlines sometimes contain emotional wording, such as this
[UK Tory civil war deepens as Michael Gove blasts Liz Truss budget](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-tory-civil-war-deepens-as-michael-gove-blasts-liz-truss-profoundly-concerning-budget/). This story, like all reviewed, relies on credible sources such as the [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [the Sunday Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/), and other Springer publications like [Bild](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bild/). Story selection is generally balanced, covering both sides.
Editorially, they provide a reasonable balance of opinions; however, slightly more op-eds favor the left through story selection and wording, such as this
[8 things to know about the environmental impact of ‘unprecedented’ Nord Stream leaks](https://www.politico.eu/article/8-thing-know-environmental-impact-unprecedented-nord-stream-leak/), and this [What Washington thinks about the next Queen Liz](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/18/what-washington-thinks-liz-truss-boris-johnson-00052667). They generally report news factually and with a more left-leaning bias in both story selection and editorial positions.
