Analysis / Bias
In review, Inc. Magazine publishes original content on investing, business and marketing. Articles and headlines do not use loaded emotional language like this:
[How 1099 Workers Should Apply for Stimulus Loans](https://www.inc.com/kevin-j-ryan/small-business-loans-1099-independent-contractor-treasury-guidance.html?icid=hmsub2). Like all others reviewed, this story is correctly sourced to credible information.

[10 Things to Say Instead of Good Job](https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/10-things-to-say-instead-of-good-job.html?cid=search). When reporting on politics, Inc. Magazine generally reports directly and factually. However, some articles are slightly negative toward the former Trump administration, such as this: [President Trump Tried to Take Credit for Apple’s Mac Pro Manufacturing Plant. Here’s Why He Shouldn’t](https://www.inc.com/don-reisinger/president-trump-tried-to-take-credit-for-apples-mac-pro-manufacturing-plant-heres-why-he-shouldnt.html?cid=search).
