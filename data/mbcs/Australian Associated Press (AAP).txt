History
Founded in 1935, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) provides news for Australia and internationally. The AAP was initially founded by Keith Murdoch, whose son Rupert Murdoch is the owner of the right-leaning News Corp. Starting in 2014, AAP began closing down international branches and currently only publishes from Australia, New Zealand, and London.
In 2020, AAP became a

Analysis / Bias
The AAPâ€™s primary focus is on breaking news, court reporting, sport, political coverage, feature stories, fact-checking, and photographs. The news agency provides news stories to several media outlets across Australia, including
[The Daily Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-telegraph-australia/) and [The Age](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-age-australia/). Articles and headlines are often low biased and accurately reflect the content such as this [Police continue search for camper remains](https://www.aap.com.au/news/police-continue-search-for-camper-remains/). AAP does not provide hyperlinked sourcing in their news stories as they are the primary source.
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they report on politics with minimal bias, such as this
[Faith law referred to human rights inquiry](https://www.aap.com.au/news/pressure-to-protect-gay-students-teachers/). The APP provides fact-checking on both Australian and international claims such as this [Claim the unvaccinated pose no greater COVID-19 risk needs a check-up](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/claim-the-unvaccinated-pose-no-greater-covid-19-risk-needs-a-check-up/). The Australian Associated Press is a certified [signatory](https://ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories) of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) that requires strict standards and accountability in fact-checking. In general, the AAP is a credible, low-biased news agency that provides certified fact-checking.
