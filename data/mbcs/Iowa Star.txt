History
The Iowa Star is a news and opinion website with a right-leaning bias in reporting. According to their
[about page](https://theconnecticutstar.com/about-us/), “The Iowa Star – launched in February 2023 – is the newest member of the Star News Digital Media family.” According to an investigation by [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/03/04/activists-setup-local-news-sites/), The Iowa Star is not a local newspaper but rather a front for “Tea Party-connected conservative activists: Michael Patrick Leahy and Christina Botteri.” Snopes details connections to conservative donors and PACS as well.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Iowa Star presents news with a conservative bias through story selection that usually favors the right. All articles are properly sourced and generally use credible mainstream sources. There is some use of loaded words within news stories, but not excessive.
Editorially, the Iowa Star has a strong right-leaning bias with frequent use of strong, emotionally loaded words that favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this

Although The Iowa Star is right-biased and generally factual, we cannot rate them High for factual reporting due to the source being exposed as a political activism website attempting to look like a local paper. For this reason, we rate them factually Mixed based on a lack of transparency and the promotion of propaganda.
