Analysis / Bias
Knowable Magazine gathers its content from various review journals published by Annual Reviews. The magazine’s articles are designed to make complex topics understandable to a broad audience. One example of this is the article
[“All about cholesterol: The latest science on how blood levels of HDL, LDL and more relate to cardiovascular health.”](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/cholesterol-and-heart-disease-explained) This article discusses the complex roles that different types of cholesterol play in cardiovascular health, challenging the simplistic view of good versus bad cholesterol. Citing sources like scientific articles from the [Journal of Lipid Research,](https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(20)34568-5/fulltext) the Journal of the American Heart Association, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of the United States of America [(PNAS)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-of-the-united-states-of-america-pnas/) using scientific research, expert opinions, and patient experiences, the article emphasizes the importance of moving beyond a binary understanding of cholesterol and taking a detailed approach that considers the individual roles and interactions of different cholesterol types in cardiovascular health.
Moving on to a different topic, climate change has become an increasingly important subject of discussion and concern in recent years. It’s worth noting that Knowable Magazine also publishes articles on this critical topic. For instance, an article titled
[“A Lifetime of Climate Change”](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/food-environment/2022/lifetime-climate-change) explores how researcher Arun Agrawal’s personal and academic journey connects with significant milestones in climate policy and science, providing a contextual view of the shifts in climate change discourse over several decades. This narrative strategy offers a perspective that integrates individual experiences with global environmental developments, aiming to present the complexities of climate change in an accessible manner and cites sources such as [NASA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nasa/), [World Resources Institute (WRI)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-resources-institute-wri/), and un.org. In summary, Knowable Magazine provides comprehensive and thoroughly researched scientific information to a diverse readership.
