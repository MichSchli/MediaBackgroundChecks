History
Founded in 2004 by Ezra Levant, the Western Standard is an online conservative news and commentary website based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Ezra Levant later sold the publication and founded the Questionable
[Rebel News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-rebel/), known for publishing conservative viewpoints.
According to their
[about page,](https://www.westernstandard.news/site/about.html) “The original Western Standard ceased operations in 2007 but returned to publication as an online news and opinion platform in October 2019 under the ownership of the Western Standard New Media Corporation. Since that time, the Western Standard has become one of the most-read news platforms in Western Canada and has become the largest independent media platforms in Canada based on publicly available data.” [Read our profile on Canadian media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canada-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Western Standard publishes local and national news and opinion from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines frequently favor the right with loaded emotional language, such as this
[Justice Centre warns Canadian government for denying EI benefits over vaccine status](https://www.westernstandard.news/news/justice-centre-warns-canadian-government-for-denying-ei-benefits-over-vaccine-status/article_81de019e-ec16-11ec-ba6a-2b1ae288bc52.html). This story, like most, does not provide a hyperlink to the original source of information. The website also publishes straight news, such as this [State of emergency declared for Kelowna area due to flood risk](https://www.westernstandard.news/bc/state-of-emergency-declared-for-kelowna-area-due-to-flood-risk/article_c7be8642-ec30-11ec-9b3a-633216cf705a.html).
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion pieces. Under the editorial category, all stories favor the right and often denigrate progressives/liberals, such as this
[KRAYDEN: Trudeau lifts some vaccine travel restrictions – but not because of “the science”](https://www.westernstandard.news/opinion/krayden-trudeau-lifts-some-vaccine-travel-restrictions-but-not-because-of-the-science/article_64dc5d4c-ebfe-11ec-9049-57ea3f3d6185.html) and [EDITORIAL: NDP platform a free-spending socialist dream](https://www.westernstandard.news/opinion/editorial-ndp-platform-a-free-spending-socialist-dream/article_c6a0a805-240a-558b-8e5f-af5d3ced3f79.html).
When it comes to scientific issues, they do not deny the existence of human-influenced climate change but generally oppose government solutions and often refer to those who express concern as extremists
[SLOBODIAN: Changes in the name of climate will decimate society](https://www.westernstandard.news/opinion/slobodian-changes-in-the-name-of-climate-will-decimate-society/article_30d1eca2-da42-58a0-be47-45a375d821c4.html). Similarly, the Western Standard takes the same stance regarding Covid-19 [Triggered: COVID-zero policies are more dangerous than COVID-19 itself.](https://www.westernstandard.news/watch/triggered/triggered-covid-zero-policies-are-more-dangerous-than-covid-19-itself/article_d13ae45a-cb65-531f-b73b-ed76658c5654.html) Further, they have promoted misinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. See failed fact checks. Generally, the Western Standard holds a strong right/conservative bias and does not always report news factually.
