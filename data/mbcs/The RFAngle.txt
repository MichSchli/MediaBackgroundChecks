History
The RFAngle is a conservative website founded by Ryan Fournier, who also co-founded
[Students for Trump](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article104522526.html) with John Lambert. In 2019, Lambert was arrested in Tennessee on charges of [wire fraud](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/09/trump-john-lambert-students-lawsuit-jail-226802). [Students for Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/charlie-kirk-calls-students-trump-members-launch-peaceful/story?id=70227444) is currently the college campus arm of [Turning Point USA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/turning-point-usa/), founded by Charlie Kirk.

Funded by / Ownership
The RFAngle completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page or clearly disclose ownership. The staff page lists Ryan Fournier and Peter Van Voorhis as
[executive staff](https://rfangle.com/our-team/); however, it is unclear who owns the site. The online bio of [Fournier](https://rfangle.com/author/ryan-fournier/) states that “Ryan is the founder and co-chairman of Students for Trump, a national effort seeking to win the youth vote for President Trump. [Fournier](https://www.tpusa.com/ryanfournier) is also a member of Turning Point USA, where he serves as President of xStrategies Political Consulting and President of OpenPoll. Further, many staff writers are also affiliated with Turning Point USA, leading us to believe that TPUSA is the true publisher/owner of this website. Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The RFAngle publishes summarized news stories from other sources and conservative commentary. Articles and headlines feature-loaded emotional wording such as this
[Mitch McConnell’s Home Vandalized by Leftists Demanding Money](https://rfangle.com/politics/mitch-mcconnells-home-vandalized-by-leftists-demanding-money/). This story is properly sourced to the local newspaper [Courier-Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-courier-journal/). Story selection always favors the right, particularly former President Donald Trump, such as this [Trump Is 2020’s Most Admired Man, Ends Obama’s 12-Year Streak](https://rfangle.com/news/trump-is-2020s-most-admired-mank/). They usually provide hyperlinks to credible media outlets; however, they often utilize poor sources with numerous failed fact checks, such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
During and after the 2020 Presidential election, RFAngle published misinformation related to election fraud such as
[MI Dominion Voting Systems Have “Systemic Fraud,” Independent Audit Alleges](https://rfangle.com/politics/dominion-mi/), and this [EXCLUSIVE: Sidney Powell stands by fraud allegations – willing to risk personal career](https://rfangle.com/politics/exclusive-sidney-powell-stands-by-fraud-allegations-willing-to-stake-personal-career/). Thus far, there has not been proven evidence of substantial [voter fraud](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d). Further, they frequently report negatively on the left, such as this [ANTIFA is not an idea, it’s a domestic terrorist organization](https://rfangle.com/politics/antifa-is-not-an-idea-its-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/). According to the [FBI director](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-archive-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e), Antifa is an ideology, not an organization. In general, RFAngle reports news with a far-right bias that sometimes is misleading or not factual.
