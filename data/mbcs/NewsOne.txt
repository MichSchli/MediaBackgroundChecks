Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsone publishes news related to African-American issues such as racism, police brutality and highlighting prominent black figures such as Barack Obama and Kamala Harris. News reporting is often a combination of facts and opinions interjected by the author. They do not always separate opinion pieces from straight news content. Headlines and content often contain emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[How Trump’s ‘Go Back,’ Racist Attacks Could Backfire At The Polls](https://newsone.com/3883227/trump-racist-attacks-backfire-election-2020/). This story is reasonably sourced to left-leaning outlets like [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, there is a strong left-leaning bias in story selection and near 100% negative reporting on the Trump administration, such as this:
[This Is The Donald Trump Black People Warned You About.](https://newsone.com/3882879/donald-trump-racist-black-people-warned-about/) This Op-Ed is properly sourced and utilizes loaded language throughout, for example, this quote: “The only thing surprising to me is the fact that Trump’s racism is surprising to anyone. Because this is the Donald Trump that Black people have known about for ages.” In general, story selection and editorial positions consistently favor liberal positions.
