Analysis / Bias
In review, Truthdig states openly in its
[mission statement](https://www.truthdig.com/about-us/) that they are progressive: “The website’s mission is to dig beneath the headlines, provide expert reporting and commentary from a progressive point of view and offer an outlet for original work by exceptional journalists.”
Truthdig writes original content that uses moderately loaded language such as this:
[The Real Russian Menace Is Just Hypercapitalism](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-real-russian-meance-is-just-hypercapitalism/). This story is properly sourced to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) and clearly labels it as an opinion piece. In another story with loaded language, [The GOP’s White Supremacy Now Has a Smoking Gun](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-gops-white-supremacy-now-has-a-smoking-gun/), there is again proper labeling as an opinion piece and proper sourcing from [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/).
Straight news mostly comes from other sources, such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), and the Independent Media Institute. News is broken down into categories such as education, environment, health, and politics, to name a few. In general, straight news favors the left, and editorially there is a strong left-leaning bias through the issues they advocate.
