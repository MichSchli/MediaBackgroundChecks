Analysis / Bias
Americans United for Separation of Church and State or AU advocate for religion to be separate from government. They achieve this by publishing news and press releases such as this
[Americans United Urges Supreme Court To Protect Taxpayers From Being Forced To Pay For Private Religious Education](https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/Supreme-Court-Carson-Vouchers). They also publish a blog that leans left in its editorial positions, such as this [Public Schools Serve The Public Good — That’s Why They Alone Deserve Taxpayer Support](https://www.au.org/blogs/public-schools-public-good).
The AU consistently fought against former President Trump’s expansion of religion in government
[AU Continues The Legal Fight Against President Trump’s Unconstitutional Muslim Ban](https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-of-separation/au-continues-the-legal-fight-against-president-trump-s-unconstitutional) and continues to advocate for [LGBTQ rights](https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/in-landmark-decision-for-lgbtq-equality-supreme-court-affirms-employment). Generally, they report news factually and with a strong left-leaning bias, as they tend to be pro-science on all issues.
