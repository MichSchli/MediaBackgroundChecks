History
[Founded in 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monthly), the Washington Monthly is a bimonthly liberal-leaning nonprofit magazine and website of politics and government. According to their [about page](https://washingtonmonthly.com/about), their primary focus is on Government reform: “We don’t chase news cycles, or obsess over the endless political horse race. We care about how the government can be improved and why it hasn’t; who’s a fraud and who isn’t; which ideas ought to be banished from the nation’s capital and which ones deserve to be championed.”
The Washington Monthly lists a Masthead, which indicates the Editor-in-Chief is

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Washington Monthly publishes news and commentary regarding Washington, DC, politics. Story selection often favors the left and utilizes moderately emotional language such as this:
[Trump Won’t Buck His Base to Address Gun Violence](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/09/06/trump-wont-buck-his-base-to-address-gun-violence/). This story is appropriately sourced to the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). In another article, [The Electoral College Is Not What Its Defenders Say It Is](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/09/07/the-electoral-college-is-not-what-its-defenders-say-it-is/), they advocate for the left-leaning position of replacing the electoral college with a popular vote. This article is properly sourced as well to numerous credible media and information outlets.
Editorially, the Washington Monthly clearly favors Democratic party positions; however, they tend to report with caution when covering the more progressive wing of the party:
[What Sanders and Warren Get Wrong on Free College](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/july-august-2019/what-elizabeth-warrens-free-college-plan-gets-wrong/). In general, they generally hold mostly left-center positions and report information factually and backed with evidence.
