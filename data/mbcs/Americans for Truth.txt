History
Launched in 1996, Americans For Truth About Homosexuality (AFTAH) describes itself on their
[About Page](https://americansfortruth.com/about/) as an “educational group” with a goal of “exposing the homosexual-bisexual-transgender activist agendas.” [Peter LaBarbera](https://americansfortruth.com/about/) is the [founder](https://twitter.com/PeterLaBarbera?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and the President. The about page further explains their mission as “AFTAH seeks to apply the same single-minded determination to opposing the radical homosexual agenda and standing for God-ordained sexuality and the natural family as countless homosexual groups do in promoting their harmful agenda.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Peter LaBarbera states
[his views](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/children-exposed-to-homosexual-makeouts-on-kiss-cam-at-dodgers-baseball-gam) in a blog post, in which he states, “As America and the West rapidly de-Christianize, the physical, spiritual, and moral threats to our children rise, seemingly in inverse proportion to the expanding godless chaos. The LGBTQ movement, essentially a powerful, well-marketed sin movement, is right up there with radical feminists in tearing down centuries-old norms and our children’s innocence in the process.”
In review, the website features a link to
[Pro-Truth resources](https://americansfortruth.com/pro-truth-resources/), which essentially links to far-right Christian organizations and other hate groups such as the [Family Research Council](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/family-research-council/). AFTAH also features a blog presumably written by Peter LaBarbera, though there isn’t much information to make that determination. The blog features loaded emotional wording such as this: [Legal “Gay Marriage” Ruling Was Built on a Lie](https://americansfortruth.com/2019/06/13/legal-gay-marriage-was-built-on-a-lie-ex-gays-pro-family-leaders-to-rally-against-fake-same-sex-marriage-and-radical-lgbtq-equality-act-at-supreme-court-on-obergefell-v-hodges-ann/). In another story, they demonstrate support for President Trump: [Trump Flushes Obama’s Transgender Bathroom School Order – HRC in a Tizzy](https://americansfortruth.com/2017/02/13/trump-flushes-obamas-transgender-bathroom-school-order-hrc-in-a-tizzy/). In general, the sole purpose of this website is to promote far-right Christian propaganda against the LGBTQ through the use of poor sources such as [LifeSiteNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Further, according to
[The Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), Americans For Truth About Homosexuality (AFTAH) is a [hate group.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/18-anti-gay-groups-and-their-propaganda)
