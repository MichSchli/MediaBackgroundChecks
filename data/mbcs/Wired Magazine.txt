History
Based in San Francisco, California, Wired Magazine was launched in 1993 by
[avid libertarian](https://www.adweek.com/digital/how-wired-magazine-changed-way-we-talk-about-technology-148425/) Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, his partner in business and life. Wired covers the tech industry, such as the internet and digital culture, science, and security. In 1998, Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe [sold ](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/11/business/digital-culture-pioneer-sold-to-conde-nast.html)Wired Magazine to Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications Inc., for about $80 million. Former editor of the [New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/), [Nicholas Thompson](https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2017/02/emerging-tech-council-bios/), was named editor in chief of Wired in 2017. Thompson is also a contributor for [CBS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) and regularly appears on CBS This Morning and [CBSN](https://www.cbsnews.com/cbsn/). He is a co-founder of [The Atavist](https://magazine.atavist.com/).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Wired publishes magazine stories, news analysis, and web stories focusing on
[technology](https://www.wired.com/story/how-nato-defends-against-the-dark-side-of-the-web/). In doing so, they utilize emotive language both in their headlines and body of articles such as [“Here’s how Facebook actually won Trump the presidency.”](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/) Wired also reports on political issues that are related to the tech industry. For example, editor in chief Nicholas Thompson [mentions in an interview](https://wwd.com/business-news/media/media-people-wired-editor-in-chief-nicholas-thompson-11133787/), Wired’s position on [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) and why they report on it. We examined one of those articles, [“Kavanaugh On The Supreme Court Could Spell Trouble For Tech](https://www.wired.com/story/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-could-spell-trouble-for-tech/#comments),” which favors a left-leaning viewpoint on the subject.
When it comes to sourcing, Wired typically utilizes credible sources such as cadc.uscourts.gov,
[Associated Press,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) [Military.com,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-com/) [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/), and [US News and World Report.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/us-news-world-report/) Wired also publishes pro-science articles such as [“The Complexity of Simply Searching For Medical Advice”](https://www.wired.com/story/the-complexity-of-simply-searching-for-medical-advice/) and utilizes pro-science sources such as [PubMed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/) and the [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/).
