Analysis / Bias
Sayfie Review serves as a news curator/aggregator with a lack of original content. While the website owner may lean right throughout their political history, the website draws from both left and right sources such as
[Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Sun-Sentinel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-florida-sun-sentinel/), [Tallahassee Democrat](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tallahassee-democrat/), [Tampa Bay Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tampa-bay-times/), and international media the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Based on these sources ranging from left-center to right-center, we rate their aggregated content as least biased due to covering both sides. Sayfie Review also has its own columnist who writes political analysis. These articles display minimal bias and are very well-sourced.
