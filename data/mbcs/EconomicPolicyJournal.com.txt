History
EconomicPolicyJournal.com (EPJ) is an economics and politics blog that does not have an about page; however, it lists Robert Wenzel as the editor/publisher.
[Robert Wenzel](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2018/08/are-americans-already-socialists.html) is an author who “considers the writings of Ludwig von Mises, F.A Hayek, Murray Rothbard, Henry Hazlitt, and Harry Browne as the most important influences on his thinking.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, EconomicPolicyJournal.com primarily covers economics from a Libertarian/Austrian Economics perspective. Article headlines use moderately loaded headlines such as this:
[Jordan Peterson Destroys the Notion That the Norwegian Social Engineering Requirement, That 40% of Board Members Be Female, is Successful.](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2018/08/jordan-peterson-destroys-notion-that.html) In general, information is well sourced to credible media outlets.
EconomicPolicyJournal.com strongly promotes Austrian Economics (Anarcho-Capitalism), in which there is almost zero government intervention and regulation of markets. Based on this, EPJ does not have a favorable view of the Trump administration’s
[economic approach](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2018/08/how-will-trump-react-to-economic.html).
