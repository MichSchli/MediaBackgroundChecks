Analysis / Bias
In review, Stratfor attempts to interpret the significance of today’s global events to provide a way to navigate an “ever-changing and complex global environment.” The website provides news through their Worldview with low bias such as this
[The Cost of Egypt’s Continued Economic Growth](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/cost-egypt-s-continued-economic-growth). They also report on political moves such as those by the Trump administration with minimal bias such as this [Somalia: Trump Orders Plan for Troop Withdrawal From Somalia](https://worldview.stratfor.com/situation-report/somalia-trump-orders-plan-troop-withdrawal-somalia). In general, the news is factual and not editorialized.
