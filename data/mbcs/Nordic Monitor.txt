In review, the Nordic Monitor publishes articles critical of the Erdogan government with emotionally loaded language such as
[“Turkey has a plan for the invasion of Greece, secret documents reveal”](https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2020/06/turkey-planned-to-invade-greece-secret-document-reveals/) and [“Turkish Embassy in Washington spied on critical journalist, collected intel on him.”](https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2020/06/turkish-embassy-in-washington-spied-on-critical-journalist-collected-intel-on-him/) The Turkish journalist mentioned in the article is exiled journalist [Emre Uslu](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-seeks-arrest-of-fethullah-gulen-over-russian-ambassador-karlovs-murder-129684) who is accused of having close ties with the [Gulen Movement](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36855846).
When it comes to sourcing, they often hyperlink to themselves or use large quotes referring to “documents” they allegedly obtained. Almost every article
[mentions](https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2019/11/turkey-planned-to-extract-8-turkish-officers-from-greece-secret-document-reveals/) “confidential documents obtained by Nordic Monitor.” Further, they also utilize other Fethullah Gulen-linked websites such as [The Stockholm Center for Freedom (SCF)](https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2020/05/turkey-worlds-largest-prison-for-journalists-will-host-oic-media-organization/) or their other anti-Turkey [projects](https://turkey-isis.org/).
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they rarely cover the Trump administration; however, when they do, it is always related to Turkey, such as
[“Former US envoy claims 40,000 ISIS fighters traveled to Syria via Turkey”](https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2019/10/former-us-envoy-claims-40000-isis-fighters-came-via-turkey/). The Nordic Monitor generally has a very strong anti-Erdogan bias and promotes propaganda.
