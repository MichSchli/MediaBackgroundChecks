In review, Novinky.cz predominantly delivers tabloid-style news and crime stories that typically rely on heavily image-focused articles with sensational headlines such as “
[Aren’t you in the mood for sex? Try these six sexy activities.”](https://www.novinky.cz/zena/vztahy-a-sex/clanek/nemate-naladu-na-sex-vyzkousejte-techto-sest-sexy-aktivit-40344544#seq_no=1&dop_ab_variant=0&dop_source_zone_name=novinky.web.nexttoart&dop_req_id=0REAZHlXdPN-202012082011&source=article-detail) When covering national news, the headlines use moderately loaded language such as [”Babiš expelled Prymula from the government and apologized for him.” ](https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/babis-vyhodil-prymulu-z-vlady-a-omluvil-se-za-nej-40340194)and more neutral wording such as [“Zeman wants to veto the tax package.”](https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/zeman-chce-vetovat-danovy-balicek-40343868) When it comes to sourcing, they use The Czech News Agency (ČTK); however, they rarely use hyperlinks but offer quotations and frequently hyperlink to themselves, such as here [“Zeman: Sometimes businesses that would normally go bankrupt reach out.”](https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/clanek/zeman-nekdy-natahuji-ruku-i-podniky-ktere-by-normalne-zkrachovaly-40338832) When covering world news about the USA, they use sources such as [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/) and [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/) while covering the Trump administration with a critical tone such as this [“Trump is planning big meetings, he intends to brand obituaries of allegedly dead voters.” ](https://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/amerika/clanek/trump-planuje-velke-mitinky-hodla-se-ohanet-nekrology-udajnych-mrtvych-volicu-40341681) Further, they also report negatively on right-wing populism such as that found in [Poland](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poland-media-profile/): [With the victory, Biden cruelly disappointed Warsaw](https://www.novinky.cz/volby/usa/clanek/vitezstvim-biden-krute-zklamal-varsavu-40344086#utm_content=ribbonnews&utm_term=biden&utm_medium=hint&utm_source=search.seznam.cz).
