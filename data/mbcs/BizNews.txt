Analysis / Bias
Biznews.com primarily focuses on business and financial news, emphasizing South African and international markets. Their
[“Investment”](https://www.biznews.com/energy/2023/05/04/diamonds-gold-oil-west-coast-karoo) section includes subsections on Asset Management, Global Citizen, Global Investing, SA Investing, and Wealth Advisors, offering insights on asset management, global investment opportunities, investing in South Africa, and wealth advisory services.
Biznews also publishes national news and information. For example, a recent article titled
[“Race incident at Cape Town pub catches attention of EFF”](https://www.biznews.com/africa/2022/12/07/race-incident-cape-town-pub-catches-attention-eff) highlights the response of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a Pan-African [socialist](https://jacobin.com/2021/07/economic-freedom-fighters-eff-julius-malema-identity-class-south-african-politics) and leftist political party. The article demonstrates bias in favor of the EFF and portrays the pub in question negatively. Emotionally loaded language such as “blatant racism,” “criminalization,” and “racial profiling” is used in the article. The article primarily sources statements from the EFF and video footage circling on social media.
Another article published on Biznews criticizes Cyril Ramaphosa:
[“How world sees SA: Ramaphosa’s ICC gaffe underscores Putin quandary – FT”.](https://www.biznews.com/premium-signup?mepr-unauth-page=1006832&redirect_to=%2Fpremium%2F2023%2F04%2F28%2Framaphosa-icc-putin) In this article, the primary source of information is from the [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/), which is critical of Ramaphosa.
While the website covers many topics, it tends to lean right in its editorial perspective and has published unproven and misleading claims related to climate change and Covid-19.
