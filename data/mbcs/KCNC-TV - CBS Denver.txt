Analysis / Bias
In review, the CBS Denver website publishes sports, entertainment, lifestyle, and local news for the greater Denver region through
[CBSN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/). Local news articles and headlines use minimal emotionally loaded wording such as this: [Officer Eric Talley Among 10 Killed In Boulder King Soopers Shooting](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/03/22/king-soopers-shooting-boulder-police-officer-killed/). Most stories are accompanied by a video from the TV station. National news stories are published from other [CBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/) affiliates as well as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, CBS Denver does not publish op-eds, however, they do report on politics with slightly more stories favoring the left such as this
[Media Literacy Bill Passes State House, Moves Onto State Senate](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/03/22/media-literacy-fake-news-state-capitol/), and this [Colorado Supporters of Joe Biden Excited By National Performance](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/03/03/colorado-joe-biden-super-tuesday-primary/). In general, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning bias when covering politics.
