History
Founded in 2009 by conservative radio hosts Amy Jo Clark and Miriam Weaver, Chicksontheright.com is a news and opinion website featuring their commentary and others. According to their
[about page](https://www.chicksonright.com/about-us/), “We’re chicks who developed an interest in politics around the time of the 2008 presidential campaign, which is pretty much when we realized that this country is being taken in a completely wack direction by liberal Democrats. And so we’ve decided to talk about it in an open forum.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Chicks on the Right publishes news and commentary from a conservative perspective. They do not produce original news reporting but publish existing news stories with added conservative commentary. Articles and headlines often contain moderately loaded emotional language that favors the Right such as this
[Biden Is ALL OVER THE PLACE On Taking A Cognitive Test](https://www.chicksonright.com/blog/2020/08/07/biden-is-all-over-the-place-on-taking-a-cognitive-test/). This story is sourced to the factually Mixed [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/) and Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Editorially, Chicks on the Right do not hide the fact that they are conservative, and opinions always reflect that. For example, they are fans of former President Trump, such as this
[Trump Bombshell, Biden Mental State, And KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN](https://www.chicksonright.com/blog/2020/08/06/trump-bombshell-biden-mental-state-and-keep-the-schools-open/). While they are certainly right-biased, they do not overtly publish false news but utilize poor sources and have failed a fact check.
