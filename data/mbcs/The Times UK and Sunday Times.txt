Analysis
The
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) [reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_politics/8282189.stm) The Times supported the Labour Party (left) in 2001 and 2005; however, it backed the Conservative Party (right) during European elections in June, and in 2008 they endorsed Boris Johnson for London mayor. During the 2017 general elections, the [Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) reports The Times [endorsement](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/03/which-parties-are-the-uk-press-backing-in-the-general-election) was not final; however, it supported the election of Theresa May. On the other hand, The Sunday Times endorsed The Conservatives: [“Wake up, smell the coffee, and vote Conservative.”](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2017-06-04/comment/wake-up-smell-the-coffee-and-vote-conservative-k8c9gq7h0)
The Times was
[pro-remain](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/the-papers-on-brexit-betrayal-pragmatism-or-a-leap-of-faith) during the Brexit referendum, but they were backing Theresa May’s exit deal after the referendum.
Bias
In review, The Times utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“Tory leadership race: Bust-up with Carrie Symonds raises new doubts over Boris Johnson’s fitness to lead”](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/tory-leadership-race-bust-up-with-carrie-symonds-raises-new-doubts-over-boris-johnson-s-fitness-to-lead-7n060x53t) and [“Johnson takes a leading role in age of buffoonery.”](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-is-heading-for-an-age-of-buffoonery-under-boris-johnson-7mtdwjh6v) A quote from the article reads, “The buffoon-in-chief will soon run Britain. Otherwise known as mini-Trump.” When it comes to the US and Trump administration, the tone is negative towards President Trump, such as [“Trump sold nuclear tech to Saudis in secret after Khashoggi killing](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/trump-sold-nuclear-tech-to-saudis-in-secret-after-khashoggi-killing-9q39glhwc).” When it comes to sourcing, they often source back to themselves rather than hyperlinking to external sources.
The Sunday Times slightly differs from The Times in that they have stronger
[conservative editorial positions](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2017-06-04/comment/wake-up-smell-the-coffee-and-vote-conservative-k8c9gq7h0). They also produce more investigative journalism through their I [nsight Investigative Team](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/). Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 52% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 17% do not, ranking them #6 in trust of the major UK news providers.
