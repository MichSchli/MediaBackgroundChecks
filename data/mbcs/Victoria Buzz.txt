Analysis / Bias
The Victoria Buzz covers news and events in and around the greater Victoria, BC area. Stories are usually written by staff reporters and use minimal bias in wording, such as this
[RCMP release photo of suspect wanted in north Nanaimo targeted shooting](https://www.victoriabuzz.com/2022/07/rcmp-release-photo-of-suspect-wanted-in-north-nanaimo-shooting/). The reports reference credible sources such as [CTV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ctv-news/) and [Global News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-news/).
Editorially, they appropriately label opinion content. A review of op-eds demonstrates reasonable balance with slightly more favoring the left, such as this
[: How Pride movements in Victoria are often not inclusive spaces](https://www.victoriabuzz.com/2020/12/opinion-how-pride-movements-in-victoria-are-often-not-inclusive-spaces/). Generally, the news is reported factually and with a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
