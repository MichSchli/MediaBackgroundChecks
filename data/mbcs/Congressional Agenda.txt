Analysis / Bias
The article
[“HUGE! Gen. Milley Confirms Trump Never Issued An ‘Illegal Order’ Following 2020 Election”](https://congressionalagenda.com/huge-gen-milley-confirms-trump-never-issued-an-illegal-order-following-2020-election/) focuses on Gen. Mark Milley’s statements about [former President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). The narrative defends Trump and criticizes the mainstream media, citing the questionable [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/) as its source. The article also quotes from an [ABC News interview](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fine-top-us-military-officer-confident-jan-6/story?id=103253206) with Gen. Milley.
After examining the article, The Congressional Agenda article takes a more partisan approach, interpreting Gen. Milley’s statements as a defense of Trump and accusing “radical progressives” of painting Trump as a “dangerous dictator.” In contrast, the
[ABC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) article maintains a more neutral tone, presenting Gen. Milley’s statements in a straightforward manner.
Further, the article includes a hyperlink to The Western Journal but not to the original ABC News interview, raising concerns about transparency and sourcing practices.
Transitioning to another piece,
[“House Republicans Set Date For First Biden Impeachment Inquiry Hearing,”](https://congressionalagenda.com/house-republicans-set-date-for-first-biden-impeachment-inquiry-hearing/) the report highlights [President Joe Biden’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) scheduled impeachment inquiry hearing. The emphasis is on potential corruption allegations linked to Biden. The article leans on [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/) as its primary source and adopts a critical stance toward the current administration and strong emotional wording. A quote from the article reads, “Let’s hope the efforts of House Republicans are successful in holding Biden accountable for the corruption he has engaged in.”
In general, the Congressional Agenda holds conservative editorial biases and is not always fact-based due to relying on poor sources, a lack of transparency, and one-sided reporting.
