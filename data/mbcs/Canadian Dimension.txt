Analysis / Bias
In review, Canadian Dimension publishes news from an anti-capitalist, pro-socialist perspective:
[Red Flags: Reflections on racism and radicalism](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/red-flags-reflections-on-racism-and-radicalism). A quote from the article reads, “Capitalism lives and breathes racism. It can’t survive without it. It picks it up, cultivates it, and injects it into everything.” CD focuses on topics associated with the political left, such as [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), [Feminism](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/metoo-fighting-sexism-through-labour-activism), [Labour](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/from-1919-to-the-fight-for-15-working-class-organizing-in-winnipeg-today), and [LGBTQ](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/queer-liberation-the-social-organization-of-forgetting-and-the-resistance-o) rights. However, many stories do not contain hyperlinked sourcing.
When it comes to science, Canadian Dimension typically aligns with the consensus, though they offer more negative reporting when it comes to
[GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). Editorially, the CD is far left in support of socialism as they often criticize liberal politicians such as Justin Trudeau for their pro-corporate policies.
