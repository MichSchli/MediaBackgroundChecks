Analysis / Bias
In review, FBNewsCycle is a news and opinion site that frequently uses loaded language such as this:
[Liberal Narrative Crushed, Mueller Witness Destroys Prosecutor During Courtroom Throwdownâ€¦](http://fbnewscycle.com/podik/) This story links to the strongly right biased and mixed factual [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/). Most stories on this website come from discredited right biased sources or completely lack proper sourcing. In general, this is an extreme right wing biased site that does not source well and lacks transparency.
