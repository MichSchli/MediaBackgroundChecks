Analysis / Bias
RealClearDefense reports and links to news from other outlets and also produces its own original stories.
In review, RealClearDefense occasionally uses emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[Is H. R. McMaster the New Mr. X?](https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/is-h-r-mcmaster-the-new-mr-x/) and [Why Retribution Against China for COVID-19 Harms U.S. Interests](https://youtu.be/WbJV400FN2g).
Generally, story selection moderately favors the Right, and RealClearDefense takes a Pro-Trump stance. RealClearDefense typically sources their information to credible sources such as
[Military.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-com/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/); however, they also source factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). In general, the news is reported factually from other sources with a slight right-leaning bias in story selection; however, some of the sources have failed fact checks.
