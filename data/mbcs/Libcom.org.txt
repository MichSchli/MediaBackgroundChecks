Analysis / Bias
Libcom is the abbreviation for Libertarian Communism, also known as Anarcho-Communism. The definition is as follows: a theory of
[anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism) which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labor, and private property (while retaining respect for personal property) and in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of workers’ councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: “ [From each according to his ability, to each according to his need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need).”
In review, Libcom.org uses minimally loaded language, and most articles/information is sourced properly. News stories are contributed to the site through their users, such as this support
[ striking university workers and build worker-student solidarity](http://libcom.org/news/support-striking-university-workers-build-worker-student-solidarity-24112021)! The website also features a blog, [a library](http://libcom.org/library), and a history section with over 20K articles.
Editorially, there is a strong left-wing bias in story selection based on political philosophy. News is generally factual and adequately sourced.
