Editorially, The Manual does not publish op-eds; however, they occasionally report on politics related to their genre. Political reporting is also low biased such as this
[Elon Musk exposed his plans for Twitter in text messages](https://www.themanual.com/culture/elon-musks-plans-for-twitter/). When reporting on national politics, they rely on credible sources and cover both sides of the story, such as this [U.S. Import Ban on Chinese Region Could Lead to Resource Scarcity](https://www.themanual.com/culture/biden-nixes-chinas-xinjiang/).
