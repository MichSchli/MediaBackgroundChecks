Analysis / Bias
In review, Good publishes news and commentary from a liberal/progressive perspective. Articles and headlines often use emotionally loaded wording that denigrates the right such as this
[Fox News uses the word ‘hate’ far more often than MSNBC or CNN](https://www.good.is/fox-news-uses-the-word-hate-far-more-than-competitors). When reporting on conservatives, they often present a negative tone, such as this [Trump denounced for falsely claiming presidential election victory](https://www.good.is/trump-claims-victory-election-victory).
Editorially, Good frequently reports in the environment with concern for climate change
[416 PPM: Carbon in atmosphere hits new record high and no one is talking about it](https://www.good.is/416-ppm-carbon-in-atmosphere-hits-new-record-high-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it). Other positions held are pro-human rights, pro-choice and pro-science positions on Covid-19. Generally, the news is reported factually and with a strong left-leaning bias.
