Analysis / Bias
The Manhattan is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate local newspaper. All of the websites use the same design template using an old newspaper font for their logos.
The website publishes local news related to Connecticut that routinely favors the right, such as this:
[China, Globalists, And Democrats Exploit The First Amendment To Launch An Invasion Into The U.S.](https://themanhattan.press/2023/10/03/china-globalists-and-democrats-exploit-the-first-amendment-to-launch-an-invasion-into-the-u-s/). This article is properly sourced.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [BREAKING EXPLOSIVE: SHOCKING ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE TRUTH UNCOVERED!

While denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [President Biden’s War On Women.](https://themanhattan.press/2022/09/04/president-bidens-war-on-women/)
The The Manhattan also promotes
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://themanhattan.press/2023/01/08/livestream-1230pm-est-the-globalists-in-plain-sight-with-sasha-latypova-katherine-watt/). In general, this is an imposter website that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
