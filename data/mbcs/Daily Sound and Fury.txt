According to their [about page](https://dailysoundandfury.com/about/), “Sometimes people in Washington get it plain wrong! If conservatives support police that killing citizens without justification, climate denial, fact denial, science denial, racist and misogynistic behavior, or a litany of other absurd points of view about numerous important issues, we call them out.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Sound and Fury primarily publishes curated news stories from other left-leaning sources and claims to produce original content. However, after a lengthy search, we could not find original content. Perhaps we did not go back far enough? The primary sources used for republishing news are the
[Daily Kos](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-kos/) (left-mixed), [Common Dreams](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/common-dreams/) (left-high), and [Politizoom](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politizoom/) (left-mixed). Story selection consistently favors the left and denigrates the right. Further, the primary target for the Daily Sound and Fury is former President Trump and his administration. In general, this is a strong left-leaning, progressive website that utilizes some factually mixed sources.
Failed Fact Checks
- None, however, they reference sources who consistently fail fact checks.
