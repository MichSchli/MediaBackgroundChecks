Analysis / Bias
In review, Healio publishes news about the health care industry and research from Slack’s peer-reviewed journals. News is broken down into specialty categories such as Cardiology, Dermatology, and Orthopedics, to name a few. Under their “news” section, headlines are free from bias, such as this
[FDA approves Sevenfact for certain adults, adolescents with hemophilia](https://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/hematology/news/online/%7B9d90c062-d2f3-4f61-a624-5f5f53e04496%7D/fda-approves-sevenfact-for-certain-adults-adolescents-with-hemophilia). This article, like all others, is strongly sourced. Under the “journals” tag, they offer links to Slacks peer-reviewed journals.
Editorially, Healio does not take sides in politics but instead reports on how it relates to health. As of this writing, we are dealing with the Covid-19 crisis; however, in 2017, Dr. Fauci, who was frequently seen with former President Trump and serves as an infectious disease expert, said this in 2017:
[Fauci: ‘No doubt’ Trump will face surprise infectious disease outbreak](https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7B85a3f9c0-ed0a-4be8-9ca2-8854b2be7d13%7D/fauci-no-doubt-trump-will-face-surprise-infectious-disease-outbreak). I am only posting that because I was surprised to find it. How cool? In general, this is a low-biased scientific website.
