Analysis / Bias
In review, The Austin Chronicle primarily covers entertainment news within the Austin area. They do occasionally cover politics with a left-wing bias in story selection and wording. An example article reads:
[The Hightower Report: Who’s Left for Trump to Tweet-bomb?](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2017-08-25/the-hightower-report-whos-left-for-trump-to-tweet-bomb/) Throughout the article, there is significant use of loaded words to portray Trump in a negative light, such as this quote from the article: ‘Then came “The Great Donald Debacle” – his bumbling, shameful response to the racist, anti-Semitic rampage in Charlottesville by a menagerie of neo-Nazis, KKK thugs, and swastika-clad white supremacists. His empathy with these far-right extremists was so appalling that even his multimillionaire allies in Fortune 500 corporations gagged.’
News stories are well-sourced with credible information, with op-eds sometimes lacking sourcing to back opinions. In 2024, the Austin Chronicle
