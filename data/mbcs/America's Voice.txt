Analysis / Bias

[The Memo: Trump’s immigration hawks grapple with new court blow](https://thehill.com/homenews/the-memo/417754-the-memo-trumps-immigration-hawks-grapple-with-new-court-blow). When reporting on the Trump Administration, there is loaded wording such as this: [Trump’s Normalizing of Corruption and Lawlessness Continues at the Border](https://americasvoice.org/press_releases/trumps-normalizing-of-corruption-and-lawlessness-continues-at-the-border/). This story is properly sourced to both the left-leaning [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and the right-leaning [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). A thorough overview of dozens of articles indicates that story selection almost always favors the left. In general, America’s Voice is factual and well-sourced with a left-leaning mission of easier immigration and protection for refugees.
