History
Founded in 1938 by Joyce Porter Arneill and
[Marion Martin](https://www.jofreeman.com/polhistory/martin.htm), the National Federation of Republican Women (NFRW) is a grassroots Republican women’s organization whose [objectives](https://www.nfrw.org/about-nfrw) are to empower women, recruit and elect Republican candidates, and promote the principles of the Republican Party. Currently, the president of NFRW is [Ann Schockett](https://www.nfrw.org/schockett), and it is based in Alexandria, Virginia. The National Federation of Republican Women is [organized at the local, state, and regional levels.](https://www.nfrw.org/directory) For example, they set up Republican women’s clubs at the local level, and they campaign for their party through these clubs.

Funded by / Ownership
The NFRW does not clearly describe the ownership structure, and donations are not tax-deductible, meaning they are not a nonprofit. Revenue is derived through a
[shop](https://www.nfrw.org/shop) that sells merchandise and [donor](https://www.nfrw.org/contribute) programs. [According](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=541640749&cycle=2018) to [OpenSecrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), the top donors are from their state-level organizations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, through the
[Americanism](https://www.nfrw.org/americanism) program, the NFRW carries out educational programs and projects such as sponsoring a video contest on the topic of “Patriotism in America Today.” They also promote respect for the American Flag, such as “Teaching the rules of Flag etiquette, Donating patriotic books to libraries and schools, Sponsoring patriotic essay contests for schools, and Presenting flags to schools and community groups.” Further, they publish articles under the Federation News section, such as [“The republican party is the party of diversity,”](https://www.nfrw.org/news/ArtMID/10689/ArticleID/4830/The-Republican-Party-is-the-Party-of-Diversity) which usually focuses on news about the organization.
Editorially, NFRW promotes conservative causes and candidates such as this

In general, the website only publishes news related to their organization with a right bias. Further, members have publicly made false claims (see below).
