Analysis / Bias
London Web News republishes or summarizes news stories from other sources. Articles and headlines are usually highly sensationalized, such as this
[Sex Addict and BDSM Fantasist Lured Teenage Girl to his House and Brutally Killed Her](http://londonwebnews.com/sex-addict-and-bdsm-fantasist-lured-teenage-girl-to-his-house-and-brutally-killed-her/). Further, they do not credit the sources they are republishing, which is both plagiarism and copyright infringement. They also publish stories that appear to be fabricated entirely, such as this [British Soldiers Disguised as Muslim Women to Avoid being Captured by the Taliban](http://londonwebnews.com/british-soldiers-disguised-as-muslim-women-to-avoid-being-captured-by-the-taliban/). There arenâ€™t any other sources or evidence that this is true.
Editorially, they do not seem to have editorial bias and just publish sensational or fake news stories.
