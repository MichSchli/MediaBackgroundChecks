Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Grail reports on a wide variety of science as well as
[pseudoscience](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Greg_Taylor#cite_note-1). Interestingly, they also properly debunk conspiracies and, at the same time, promote some. One of the primary themes of this website is the [existence of an afterlife](https://www.dailygrail.com/2013/12/top-five-phenomena-that-offer-evidence-for-an-afterlife/), which at this point, there is zero evidence to support. The Daily Grail also likes to refer to skeptics such as [James Randi](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/james-randi-educational-foundation/) as [Guerrilla Skeptics](https://www.dailygrail.com/2013/10/maverick-biologist-rupert-sheldrake-criticizes-attacks-by-guerilla-skeptics-on-wikipedia/) due to their aggressive nature in debunking false claims and conspiracies, such as the paranormal.
What makes the Daily Grail deceiving is they publish many well-sourced pro-science articles, yet in between these are numerous articles referencing the existence of an afterlife, potential alien visitations, and the paranormal.
