Analysis / Bias
In review, Being Liberal takes news stories from other sources, such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and re-writes them from a left-wing perspective. There is the frequent use of loaded language such as this: [Trump’s Immigration Policy is Built on a Base of Lies and Racism](https://www.themaven.net/beingliberal/room/trump-s-immigration-policy-is-built-on-a-base-of-lies-and-racism-QEWdcao6nUuU_Dhc-8mcIg/). The sources for stories are always linked back to the original work and are typically left-leaning. They have failed fact-checks.
