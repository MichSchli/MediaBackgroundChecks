History
[Founded in 2016](https://www.newnationalist.net/about-tnn/) by Russ Winter, The New Nationalist is a blog focusing on conspiracy theories and aims to “speak truth to power.” According to their about page, “Since starting the site in June 2016, we have come to realization that there is a severely suppressed hidden history and agenda. The global media is totally corrupt, and the term “Lugenpresse” is well deserved. The term “matrix” also truly applies. We strive to bring forth what has been hidden, to peel back the matrix.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The New Nationalist is a right-wing blog that posts conspiracy theories about Barack Obama, such as
[Will Barack Obama’s Real Father Please Stand Up](https://www.newnationalist.net/2016/09/18/will-barack-obamas-real-father-please-stand-up/).
Some articles are anti-Semitic such as this
[Jews Create J-Dar to Rate Jewishness of Movies, Films](https://www.newnationalist.net/2016/07/20/jews-create-j-dar-to-rate-jewishness-in-movies-and-films/).
The Pizzagate theory gets several articles like
[The New York Times ‘Fact Checks’ Pizzagate, Labels The New Nationalist ‘Fake News’](https://www.newnationalist.net/2016/11/22/new-york-times/). This theory was found to be [false](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/09/fact-check-pizzagate-is-not-real.html).
For sourcing, most links are internal and merely link back to the article being read rather than linking to external evidence.
