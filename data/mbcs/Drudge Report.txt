History
[Founded in 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drudge_Report) as one of the first independent web-only news sources, The Drudge Report is a politically conservative American news aggregation website run by Matt Drudge. The site consists mainly of links to stories from the United States and international media about politics, entertainment, and current events; it also has links to many columnists. Occasionally, Drudge authors new stories himself, based on tips. The Drudge Report focuses on sensationalized stories with a right-wing bias. Matt Drudge and Charles Hunt edit the website [.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hurt)
In 2016, Matt Drudge was a strong supporter of Donald Trump; however, in 2018, Drudge began distancing himself from Trump and openly criticized
[ him](https://www.cjr.org/politics/drudge-report-trump.php), primarily for Trump’s broken promises on the border wall and immigration.
Due to this change in position, some strong Trump supporters have labeled The Drudge Report as the progressive left. For example, Conservative/Libertarian Trump supporter Tucker Carlson
[stated](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/509017-tucker-carlson-matt-drudge-is-now-firmly-a-man-of-the-progressive-left) that Matt Drudge is “firmly a man of the progressive left,” with the conservative [Fox News host](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) comparing the Drudge Report founder to [The Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/) or “any other woke propaganda outlet posing as a news company.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Drudge Report typically provides hyperlinks to external news sources, in which Matt Drudge writes the lead in headlines. In the past, almost all news stories favored the right and linked to right-leaning sources. Drudge is also frequently linked to conspiracy sources such as
[ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) and [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and Questionable sources, with very poor fact-check records, such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/), and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Today, the Drudge Report typically links to more credible, lower-biased sources such as the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). However, there are still times when they publish the Questionable Breitbart as well as the [Daily Mail](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/).
Drudge Report also publishes columns from a wide range of journalists such as Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, and Ben Shapiro on the right and Paul Krugman and Maggie Haberman on the left. For the most part, the majority are right-leaning columnists, with many who have poor track records with fact-checkers.
Although the Drudge Report no longer supports Donald Trump, they clearly favor the right based on story selection and the right-leaning columnists that dominate the website. A review of 50 articles revealed that 16 favored the right and 9 favored the left, with the rest falling into a non-political category. In general, the Drudge Report has moderated toward a more
[Right-Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right-center/) stance since the last review.
Finally, in the past, the Drudge Report has also promoted numerous debunked conspiracy theories such as The
[President Obama Birther](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/business/media/28birth.html) conspiracy and that [Undocumented children are violent criminals](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/6/18/17475356/drudge-report-immigration-families-children-trump). A review of articles over the last two years indicates they have not failed a fact check and do not regularly publish conspiratorial content.
