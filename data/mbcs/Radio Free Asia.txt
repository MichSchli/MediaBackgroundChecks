Analysis / Bias
In review, Radio Free Asia publishes news for Asian countries such as Cambodia, China, North Korea, Myanmar, and Vietnam from an American perspective. News reporting uses minimally loaded language such as this
[Myanmar Reports First COVID-19 Case in Rakhine War Refugee Camps](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/idps-covid-10162020203746.html). This story is properly sourced to the [World Health Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/). In another story they report [Taiwan’s First Female President Starts Talking Gender Equality](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/equality-10162020110313.html), which focuses on the left-leaning theme of gender equality.
In general, story selection leans left and promotes a pro-American perspective such as this
[U.S. Renews Ban on Communist Party Members Seeking to Emigrate](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/usa-ccp-ban-10052020134710.html?searchterm:utf8:ustring=%20america). This story is properly sourced to the [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). RFA reports news factually and with a slight left-leaning bias.
