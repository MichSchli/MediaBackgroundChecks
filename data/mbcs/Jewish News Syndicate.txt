History
According to its about page
[JNS or Jewish News Syndicate](https://www.jns.org/about/) is a news site that focuses on Israeli and Jewish-related news and analysis around the world. [Jonathan S.

Analysis / Bias
Although JNS uses neutral language in their headlines and articles, they typically source through quotes
[“Trump: Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was pinnacle of my first year](https://www.jns.org/trump-recognizing-jerusalem-as-israels-capital-was-pinnacle-of-my-first-year/).” They also use right-biased sources such as [Israel Hayom](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-hayom/). We also found instances where they did not provide hyperlinked sourcing. American business magnate Sheldon Adelson (Deceased) owns [Israel Hayom](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-hayom/). Adelson was also a JNS [donor](https://www.jns.org/opinion/no-need-to-imagine-life-without-bibi/) and a large contributor to Donald Trump’s 2016 and 2020 election campaigns.
In this review, we found excessive use of loaded emotional wording favoring the Israeli government, such as the
[IDF slays dozens of terrorists in Gaza Strip](https://www.jns.org/idf-slays-dozens-of-terrorists-in-gaza-strip/) and [Gov’t approves plan to rehabilitate Gaza-border towns](https://www.jns.org/govt-approves-plan-to-rehabilitate-gaza-border-towns/). Further, op-eds frequently favor Israel and denigrate the Palestinians, such as this [Where are the ‘peaceful’ citizens of Gaza?](https://www.jns.org/where-are-the-peaceful-citizens-of-gaza/) In general, The Jewish News Syndicate holds right-leaning biases and sometimes promotes pro-Israeli government propaganda.
Failed Fact Checks
- None in the Last 5 years
Overall, We rate the Jewish News Syndicate as Right-Center biased based on its editorial position in support of the Israeli government. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sourcing techniques and the promotion of one-sided propaganda. (M. Huitsing 2/25/2018) Updated (12/11/2023)
