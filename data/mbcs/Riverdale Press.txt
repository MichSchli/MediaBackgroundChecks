Analysis / Bias
In review, The Riverdale Press covers local news from the Bronx with minimal bias in wording such as this:
[Manhattan College students clean up](https://riverdalepress.com/stories/manhattan-college-stuents-clean-up,70569). In another story that focuses on local crime, there is again little bias such as this: [Neighbor helps nab credit card pilferer](https://riverdalepress.com/stories/neighbor-helps-nab-credit-card-pilferer,70556?). Both of these stories lack hyperlinked sourcing, which is appropriate as this is a print newspaper. The latter crime story is properly sourced from a police report.
A review of editorials demonstrates a reasonable balance between left and right opinion, some editorials lean left with
[concerns about climate change](https://riverdalepress.com/stories/war-continues-between-those-with-cars-and-those-without,70528?), and some lean right with [criticism](https://riverdalepress.com/stories/come-home-mayor-de-blasio,69820?) of former Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio. In general, Riverdale Press reports news factually with balanced editorial positions.
