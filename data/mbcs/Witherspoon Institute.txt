Analysis / Bias
In 2013, the Witherspoon Institute funded a study on
[LGBTQ families](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/suspect-science) immediately called a “disgrace” by the scientific community. Being opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage does not make a source Questionable, however, promoting a discredited scientific study to support your position absolutely earns a Questionable source rating.
Editorially, all stories favor the right such as this
[Not a National Family: Critical Race Theory, Civic Education, and the Ties That Bind](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/08/77214/) and this [Common Sense Conservatism: An Interview with Tennessee Governor Bill Lee](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/07/76905/). They also promote anti-scientific religious information that is not rooted in evidence, such as this [Moral Repugnance, Abortion, and COVID Vaccines: A Dialogue](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/03/75030/). In general, this is a pro-Christian group that supports pro-Christian ideas. While this may not always align with the consensus of science, we, therefore, rate them as questionable.
