Analysis / Bias
In review, Morning Consult conducts research and surveys for businesses and media outlets using a
[scientific methodology](https://www.businessinsider.com/morning-consult-election-polls-2016-11/). The process used is called [stratified sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling), a sampling method from a population that can be partitioned into subpopulations. Morning Consult has been [praised for accuracy](https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton); for example, they predicted Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote by 3%. She won by 2.1%, which was comfortably within the margin of error. [FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/), an expert on measuring and rating pollster performance, has [evaluated 72 polls by Morning Consult](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/morning-consult/), indicating they are accurate 73% of the time or Mostly Factual. They also conclude that their polling favors the left with a score of +3.1, which equates to a Left bias in polling. In general, Morning Consult is a reasonably accurate pollster that moderately favors the left (Democratic Candidates).
Morning Consult also has a news section that is centered around polling and trends. Typically, there is minimal bias presented such as this:
[Detroit Debates Deliver Meager Returns for Bidenâ€™s Challengers](https://morningconsult.com/2019/08/02/detroit-debates-deliver-meager-returns-for-bidens-challengers/). Further, they typically stray from opinion pieces and focus on evidence-based reporting.
