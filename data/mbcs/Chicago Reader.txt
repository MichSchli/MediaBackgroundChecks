Analysis / Bias
In review, the Chicago Reader reports on cultural and political news for the greater Chicago metro area. The paper/website also publishes music and food reviews, but our focus will be on political news. When reporting political news, they often present with story selection that favors a liberal perspective, such as this
[Abolish the police? Organizers say it’s less crazy than it sounds](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-abolitionist-movement-alternatives-cops-chicago/Content?oid=23289710), and this [The front lines of police brutality](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/photos-police-brutality-protest/Content?oid=80446868). Stories are not always sourced via hyperlinks but offer first-person accounts and quotes.
Editorially, most stories favor the left, such as
[pro-LGBTQ rights](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/07/15/post-marriage-equality-disparities-persist-in-the-lgbtq-community) and [pro-science perspectives](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) on [climate change.](https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2017/05/08/emanuel-launches-new-climate-change-section-on-city-website-using-information-deleted-from-epa-and-other-chicago-news) They also frequently report [negatively](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/trump-carroll-biden/Content?oid=79704734) on Republican former President Donald Trump. In general, they report news factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
