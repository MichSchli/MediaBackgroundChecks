Analysis / Bias
In review, The Spectator USA primarily covers politics and culture with a right-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines and articles usually contain moderately loaded language that favors the right such as this:
[A fresh assassination of Brett Kavanaugh’s character](https://spectator.us/brett-kavanaugh-debbie-ramirez-character/) and this [Trump will be re-elected because of left-liberal stupidity](https://spectator.us/trump-re-elected-left-liberal-stupidity/). Information contained in articles is typically properly sourced to credible media outlets or via direct quotes.
Editorially, The Spectator USA is generally conservative in outlook, favoring President Trump’s policies and supportive of Israel. In general, story selection moderately favors the right, and information is usually properly sourced. However, during the 2020 election, they made a false claim regarding voter fraud.
