History
[Launched in May 2022](https://www.whois.com/whois/fireboebert.com), FireBoebert.com is a website published by the American Muckrakers PAC that attempts to denigrate Colorado Republican House Representative Lauren Boebert with the hope of having her defeated in the next election.
According to their
[about page](https://www.fireboebert.com/about-us), “We are American Muckrakers PAC, Inc., a non-profit political action committee that is now dedicated solely to ensuring that Colorado’s Lauren Boebert’s first term in office is her last.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The American Muckrakers PAC owns and publishes FireBoebert.com. The PAC was co-founded by
[David B. Wheeler and Colonel Moe Lewis](https://firemadison.com/about-us/leadership/). David Wheeler is CEO of International Higher Education Group LLC, while Moe Lewis was a Democratic candidate for Congress in NC-11 in 2020. They transparently publish their [FEC filing](https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00776062/) and, according to [OpenSecrets](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-responsive-politics-open-secrets/), have spent [100% of its money opposing Republicans](https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cmte=C00776062&cycle=2022). Donations generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
The American Muckrakers PAC gained traction when it developed a website called
[firecawthorn.com](https://firemadison.com/) that published damaging information, exposing Republican NC-Rep Madison Cawthorn’s illegal activities. Despite being endorsed by former President Donald Trump, the evidence presented by the PAC resulted in Cawthorn losing the primary and his seat.
The success of Fire Madison Cawthorn encouraged the PAC to target other conservative candidates such as Lauren Boebert. The fireboebert.com website features negative information on Lauren Boebert and her past. For example, they report that Rep. Boebert is under investigation for
[tax fraud and money laundering](https://www.fireboebert.com/taxfraud) and how she sold access and favors to [Mike Bishop](https://www.fireboebert.com/mike). While either may be true, there isn’t solid evidence to support either.
On June 14th, 2022, the Fire Boebert website claimed that Pro-Life Rep. Boebert had worked as a
[paid escort and had two abortions](https://www.fireboebert.com/boebertabortions) in her past. On the same day, they claimed that she crashed a 4×4 while [drunk driving](https://www.fireboebert.com/drunklauren) and begged her “Sister-in-Law to Say Nothing and Covered Up the Accident.” Again there is no evidence to support either of these claims. See failed fact checks below.
In general, the American Muckrakers PAC and fireboebert.com attempt to denigrate and defame conservatives in the hopes of ruining their election chances. As evidenced by failed fact checks and unproven claims, they are not credible or reliable for information, despite accuracy with Madison Cawthorn.
