Analysis / Bias
In review, the Group of Thirty publishes news and reports on international economic and financial issues. Reports are presented with minimal bias in wording such as this
[Fixing the Pensions Crisis: Ensuring Lifetime Financial Security](https://group30.org/publications/detail/4678). This report is sourced properly. Scientifically, the Group of Thirty supports the [consensus of science](https://group30.org/workprogram) regarding [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) as they “evaluate how countries and financial authorities can best encourage a transition to a carbon-neutral economy.” A search of the website reveals that they do not publish political articles that criticize politicians or platforms. In general, this is a low-biased, highly factual source.
