Analysis / Bias
Asia-Pacific Research primarily republishes articles from the Centre for Research on Globalization. They also publish original content infrequently, such as this
[Hong Kong’s Paradoxical “Independence” Movement](https://www.asia-pacificresearch.com/hong-kongs-paradoxical-independence-movement/5628105). Asia-Pacific Research sources information.
Editorially, they focus on Asian Democracy with articles such as
[Becoming a Democracy—The Example of Nepal](https://www.asia-pacificresearch.com/becoming-a-democracy-the-example-of-nepal/5628117). While Asia-Pacific Research does not typically report conspiracies directly, their republication of Global Research articles does. While most Asia-Pacific Research articles discuss legitimate humanitarian concerns, its view of science, economics, and geopolitics can delve into conspiracy theories.
