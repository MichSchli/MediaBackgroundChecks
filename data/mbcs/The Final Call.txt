Analysis / Bias
The Final Call consistently reflects views associated with the Nation of Islam and Minister Louis Farrakhan. The
[SPLC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) and [ADL](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) have accused the [Nation of Islam](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/louis-farrakhan) and Minister Farrakhan of promoting anti-white sentiment, homophobia, and [anti-Semitism](https://extremismterms.adl.org/glossary/final-call), claims which Farrakhan has consistently denied. For example, he responded to these organizations directly in his statement titled [“The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan Issues a Statement on the Lawsuit against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Simon Wiesenthal Center”](https://new.finalcall.com/2023/10/31/the-honorable-minister-louis-farrakhan-issues-a-statement-on-the-lawsuit-against-the-anti-defamation-league-adl-and-the-simon-wiesenthal-center/) seeking to rebut the allegations of bigotry directed at him and the Nation of Islam.
Moreover, The Final Call includes narratives that align with anti-vaccine misinformation, potentially fostering vaccine hesitancy among its readers. The article
[“Unmasking Mr. Dershowitz,”](https://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/A-Response-to-Alan-Dershowitz-Esq.shtml) promotes conspiracy theories, with claims that vaccines are “proven to have been injurious to populations around the world.” It also suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine is intended to “carry out the Henry Kissinger doctrine… which calls for a massive culling of the world’s population.” These claims lack support from scientific studies or endorsements from reputable health organizations. Such assertions are characteristic of misinformation and are unsupported by scientific consensus.
Regarding sourcing practices, The Final Call often relies on direct quotations without hyperlinks to original sources, which hinders the ability of readers to verify and contextualize the information presented.

Such instances demonstrate that the outlet’s political affiliations may not align straightforwardly with partisan perspectives. However, on some positions, such as LGBTQ rights, they align with social conservatives.
Failed Fact Checks
- None directly by a third-party fact-checker; however, there is evidence of the promotion of conspiracy theories related to Jewish people and pseudoscience with vaccines.
