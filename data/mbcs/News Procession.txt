Analysis / Bias
In review, News Procession is a news and opinion blog that frequently utilizes loaded words in headlines that favors the right:
[ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS RESIGNS – REPLACEMENT IMMEDIATELY SLAMMED BY POLITICAL LEFT.](https://newsprocession.com/2018/11/1458/) This article lacks hyperlinked sourcing as do most on this website. In another article, there are again extremely loaded words and a complete lack of sourcing: [CNN’S DON LEMON REVEALS HIMSELF TO BE ABSOLUTE RACIST – CNN LEADERSHIP CONTENT](https://newsprocession.com/2018/10/cnns-don-lemon-reveals-himself-to-be-absolute-racist-cnn-leadership-content/).
In general, this is an opinion blog that always favors the right and consistently lacks sourcing.
