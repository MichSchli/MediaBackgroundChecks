History
[Founded on 11/4/2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/79days.news), one day after the 2020 Presidential Election, 79Days.News is a far-right conspiracy and pseudoscience website that appears to be chronicling election news through the inauguration of Joe Biden. However, this website promotes misleading information indicating that Donald Trump won the election through Democratic fraud and will somehow remain President. Further, this website is a mirror copy of the extreme right conspiracy website [Banned.Video,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/banned-video/) which is a part of the [Alex Jones Network](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) of conspiracy websites.
The website completely lacks transparency as they do not offer an about page, name an editor, or disclose ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
79Day.News does not disclose ownership; however, an online store links to
[Alex Jones’s Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) store, indicating this website is a part of the Alex Jones Network of conspiracy websites. Revenue is derived through advertising, sponsored content, and the store mentioned above that sells various pseudoscience-related health products.
Analysis / Bias
In review, 79Days.News content is a mirror image of
[Banned.Video](https://banned.video/), which republishes videos with a short text description from a variety of right-wing conspiracy theorists such as [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [David Icke](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/david-icke/), [The HighWire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-highwire/), [National File](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-file/), and [Mike Adams from Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). As stated, almost all videos promote either conspiracy such as this [International Response to Trump Reveals Who Is In The Cabal](https://79days.news/watch?id=5fab499c0ad7422090a9d821) or pseudoscience such as this [What 5G & Corona-Vax Have in Common](https://79days.news/watch?id=5fa452ed65f2d419a089d931). Essentially, they promote the same as what would be found on the Infowars website or other similar conspiracy websites that align with the right.
During the post-election of Joe Biden for President, 79Days.News promoted misleading/unproven information regarding election fraud against Donald Trump. For example,
[#MaidenGate! Dems Using Women’s MAIDEN names to Cast multiple votes for them??](https://79days.news/watch?id=5fab33140ad7422090a95180) and this claim which has been proven to be false [Intelligence Insider: President Trump Setup Democrats In “Sting Operation” To Catch Them Stealing Election!](https://79days.news/watch?id=5fa480cc65f2d419a08b54e2) This claim is rated [Pants on Fire](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/facebook-posts/did-president-trump-issue-secret-watermarks-ballot/) by [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/). Finally, they also promote misinformation regarding [CoronaVirus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) as well as [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). In general, 79Days.News is not a reliable source of information on any level.
