History
[Founded in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/defendingtherepublic.org), shortly after the Presidential Election, Defending the Republic is a news and opinion website connected to the [Defending the Republic PAC](https://defendingtherepublicpac.com/about-us/). The website and pro-Trump PAC are founded by Trump Attorney [Sidney Powell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/07/01/dominion-subpoenas-giuliani-sidney-powell-mike-lindell-in-lawsuit-against-fox-news/), who promoted [baseless conspiracy theories](https://news.yahoo.com/sidney-powells-defense-lawyers-her-222016327.html) and misinformation regarding election fraud in the 2020 Presidential election.
According to their
[contact page](https://defendingtherepublic.org/#contact-us), “Defending the Republic exists to defend and protect the important rights secured to all Americans by our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These founding documents were written to protect citizens from the government. It is an everyday battle to secure these blessings of liberty for ourselves and our prosperity.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Defending the Republic is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization owned by Defending the Republic, Inc. However, Defending the Republic PAC shares the same mailing address and is owned by Sidney Powell. Both websites solicit donations. They further state, “Please do not donate to Defending The Republic, INC – Consider contributing to
[DefendingTheRepublicPAC.com](https://defendingtherepublicpac.com/donate/).”
Analysis
The website provides news and information on alleged election fraud, Covid-19, China, and the January 6th Insurrection by Trump supporters. Regarding Covid-19, they often promote misinformation regarding vaccinations such as this
[The Vaccine Causes The Virus To Be More Dangerous](https://defendingtherepublic.org/covid/). Many of the claims made in this video are proven [false](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-effectively-prevent-severe-disease-havent-shown-signs-of-antibody-dependent-enhancement-as-claimed-by-robert-malone/). On the Covid information page, they display false memes such as using [Vaers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/openvaers-bias/) data to claim there have been over 10,000 deaths due to the Covid Vaccine. Vaers is not vetted, and anyone can publish on the system; therefore, it is [unreliable](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9957832237).
The website also features an open letter by Sidney Powell, explaining why blood is not on her hands for the January 6th Insurrection.
[She states](https://defendingtherepublic.org/january-6th/), “January 6 was too late for people to show their disgust, in Washington DC, with the obvious fraud in the past election. I fully expected a “false flag” operation created by someone on the left. It
was a trap for Trump supporters. I have never encouraged violence. I abhor it. Anyone who accuses me with “having blood on my hands” or otherwise having any role in
January 6 is lying and defaming me.”
The question one must ask… was it a false flag committed by someone other than Trump supporters or were the Trump supporters trapped (by the left) into insurrection against the United States? It can’t be both.
The website also features official court filings alleging election fraud which never has come to fruition in any case.
Bias
Finally, Defending the Republic links to other news outlets, which we rate as far-right biased, conspiracy, or questionable. However, according to them, they state “Look for reliable alternative sources of information. We recommend
[The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), Undercover DC, [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [The Conservative Treehouse](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-last-refuge/), [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), Sara Carter, [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), [LindellTV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lindell-tv/), [FrankSpeech](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/), and Steve Bannon The War Room Podcast.” The sources they list are among the least reliable on the internet. In general, Defending the Republic is Far-Right biased, low factual, and not credible for factual information.
Failed Fact Checks
