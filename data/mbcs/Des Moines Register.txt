Analysis / Bias
In review, the Des Moines Register typically uses loaded emotional wording in headlines and within the body of articles. When reporting on President Trump, the Des Moines Register offers a reasonable balance of pro-Trump and anti-Trump articles such as
[“Donald Trump has had one of the most successful starts of any new president in history.”](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/05/11/donald-trump-economy-north-korea-syria/592483002/) A quote from the article reads: “An Islamified Western Europe is arguably one of the biggest stories of our time. Yet elites on both sides of the Atlantic are in denial about the coming Islamic takeover of much of Europe.” Another article is negative toward Trump with loaded emotional wording: [“Pressure on Trump worked to end child separations. Now it must work to pass a law with heart.”](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/rekha-basu/2018/06/19/border-family-separation-conservative-opposition-republicans-morality-steve-king-kim-reynolds/713616002/)
