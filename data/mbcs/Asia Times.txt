Analysis / Bias
Although
[freedom of the press](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/hong-kong) is guaranteed in Hong Kong, Reporters Without Borders placed Hong Kong 140/180 on their World Press Freedom Index. They state that “the media are finding it more and more difficult to cover sensitive stories about the Hong Kong government and Mainland China, and the need to protect their editorial positions from Beijing’s influence is increasingly noticeable.”
Asia Times typically publishes well-sourced articles:
[Should Western countries impose sanctions on Cambodia?](http://www.atimes.com/western-countries-impose-sanctions-cambodia/) However, opinion pieces have a strong anti-American sentiment such as this: “ [US rejection of ‘double freeze’ will increase tension](http://www.atimes.com/us-rejection-double-freeze-will-increase-tension/).” Asia Times also publishes stories from credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/): “ [China backs Myanmar repression in Rakhine.](http://www.atimes.com/article/china-backs-myanmar-repression-rakhine/)” While opinion pieces tend to have an anti-American bias, their straight news coverage is well-sourced and least biased. In general, the Asia Times faces some censorship from the Chinese government lowering its credibility rating.
