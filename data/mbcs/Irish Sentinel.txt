History
Launched anonymously in 2019, the Irish Sentinel is a website that hosts the Reality Bytes Radio program and publishes conspiracy and pseudoscience news articles.
The website completely lacks transparency as they do not have an about page, name editors, authors, or owners. A
[domain search](https://whois.domaintools.com/theirishsentinel.com) indicates they are indeed based in Ireland. [Read our profile on Ireland’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ireland-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Irish Sentinel website provides a link to their
[BitChute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bitchute/) Channel, which hosts the Reality Bytes Radio program. The website also publishes conspiracy and pseudoscience-related news and opinion stories from poor sources. Essentially, the Irish Sentinel is 100% opposed to scientific consensus on every issue. [Global Warming](https://theirishsentinel.com/2021/02/05/the-fraud-of-climate-change-and-the-drive-for-control/) is fake. [GMOs](https://theirishsentinel.com/2021/08/10/the-roundup-glyphosate-toxin-scam-and-conspiracy/) are not safe. [Covid-19](https://theirishsentinel.com/2020/11/18/medical-specialist-in-virology-lambasts-the-covid-hoax/) is a hoax. Vaccines are dangerous. The list goes on and on. They also report false information, claiming that Graphene Oxide is in the Covid Vaccines [VIDEO: GRAPHENE OXIDE: A TOXIC SUBSTANCE IN THE VIAL OF THE COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE](https://theirishsentinel.com/2021/08/10/video-graphene-oxide-a-toxic-substance-in-the-vial-of-the-covid-19-mrna-vaccine/). [It isn’t](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/there-is-no-conclusive-evidence-that-the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-contains-graphene-oxide/) in the vaccine.
The website also promotes conspiracy theories such as
[Chemtrails](https://theirishsentinel.com/2020/07/20/the-rand-corporation-and-the-new-manhattan-project/), [2020 US Presidential Election Fraud](https://theirishsentinel.com/?s=election+fraud), [False Flags](https://theirishsentinel.com/?s=false+flag), and the [New World Order](https://theirishsentinel.com/2021/04/28/the-global-deep-state-a-new-world-order-brought-to-you-by-covid-19/). In general, everything on this website is either anti-science, unproven, or false. Put another way, [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) is a conspiracy lightweight compared to the Irish Sentinel.
