History
Founded in 1995 by entrepreneur and activist
[Jimmy Lai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lai), Apple Daily was a Hong Kong-based pro-democracy newspaper. Jimmy Lai stepped down as director and chairman of the board of Next Digital (owner) after he was [arrested](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/world/asia/hong-kong-arrests-lai-national-security-law.html) on 10 August 2020 by the Hong Kong police on charges of violating the territory’s new [national security law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law). In April 2021, he was sentenced to an [ additional 14 months](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/jailed-hk-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-faces-new-sentence-over-illegal-assembly-2021-05-28/) in prison for “organizing illegal protests.”
As a result of Apple Daily’s editorial positions that favor pro-Democracy independence from China, Hong Kong police’s national security unit
[arrested company executives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-57578926) on 17 June 2021 for allegedly violating the national security law and froze the assets of the company and Jimmy Lai, this caused the paper to cease publication on June 24, 2021.
In December 2020, Lai was
[awarded](https://rsf.org/en/news/2020-rsf-press-freedom-awards-three-winners-selected-and-special-prize-honors-jimmy-lai-founder) the “Freedom of Press Award” by [Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) (RSF) for his role in founding Apple Daily; they claimed that under Lai’s pro-democracy leadership, they “still dared to openly criticize the Chinese regime and which widely covered last year’s pro-democracy protests.” [Read our profile on Hong Kong media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hong-kong-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Apple Daily served as a pro-Democracy newspaper advocating for Hong Kong’s independence and freedom of speech from China. Over the last year, they covered the Hong Kong protests from an anti-Chinese government perspective. They also opposed the Hong Kong government and police for their alignment with the Chinese government. To learn more about what Apple Daily meant to Hong Kong and the media, please read this article:

Editorially, Apple Daily was fiercely anti-communist with political views that align with the right. For example, the Apple Daily
[supported former President Trump](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/10/democracy-activists-who-love-trump/616891/) with opinion pieces that read, “a vote for Trump is not only for the Americans’ own interests, but it is also one that is for the survival of the free world,” complaining of the “leftist ideology permeated in Western academia and journalism.” Further, the newspaper published an investigation into [Hunter Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/how-fake-persona-laid-groundwork-hunter-biden-conspiracy-deluge-n1245387) and Communist China that a fake intelligence firm wrote. In general, Apple Daily was an extremely important paper, that with its closing, spells the end of press freedom in Hong Kong.
