Analysis / Bias
Politicalite covers UK and USA news from a right-wing populist perspective. Headlines and wording are often highly sensationalized, such as this:
[DEAD IN A DITCH: Defiant BoJo Refuses To Be Cowed By Setbacks](https://www.politicalite.com/boris-johnson/dead-in-a-ditch-defiant-bojo-refuses-to-be-cowed-by-setbacks/). This short story does not contain sourcing. In another story with a sensational headline [REVEALED: Far-left Stuchbery CAUGHT Lying Over Brexit ‘Auschwitz’ Expose](https://www.politicalite.com/far-left/revealed-far-left-stuchbery-caught-lying-over-auschwitz-expose/), the only sourcing provided is from tweets. In general, UK reporting always favors the right and does not usually source information properly.
When covering USA news, Politicalite again favors the right and in particular former President Donald Trump, such as this
[STONE COLD LOSER: Trump ROASTS Sadiq Khan As He Touches Down in London](https://www.politicalite.com/trump-in-uk/stone-cold-loser-trump-roasts-sadiq-khan-as-he-touches-down-in-london/) and this [GAME OVER: President Trump CLEARED in Mueller Report, Dems Furious](https://www.politicalite.com/usa/game-over-president-trump-cleared-in-mueller-report-dems-furious/). Further, they [endorsed](https://archive.vn/zYgpz#) Trump’s false election claims.
Politicalite also publishes misleading stories that are not supported by evidence, such as this:
[REVEALED: New Zealand Attacker WASN’T ‘Far Right’, He Was Linked To Left-Wing Groups](https://www.politicalite.com/latest/revealed-new-zealand-attacker-wasnt-far-right-he-was-linked-to-left-wing-groups/).
Failed Fact Checks
