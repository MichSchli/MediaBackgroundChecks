History
[Founded in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_(journal)) by [Kenneth Baer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Baer) and [Andrei Cherny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Cherny), Democracy Journal is a quarterly journal of progressive and liberal politics and culture. According to their [about page,](https://democracyjournal.org/about/) “we seek breakthrough thinking on the concepts and approaches that respond to the central transformations of our time: the breakdown of the ladder of upward mobility; the promise and problems of an information-based, globalized economy; new national security threats which cross old boundaries and defy old assumptions from jihadist terrorism and nuclear proliferation to climate change, pandemics, and poverty; and a society where people work and live in new and different ways.” The current editor is Michael Tomasky.
