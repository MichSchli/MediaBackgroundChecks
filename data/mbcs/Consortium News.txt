History
Consortium News is an alternative, independent news source established in 1995 by
[Robert Parry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Parry_(journalist)), who passed away in 2018. It is considered the first alternative investigative journalism internet news source. Consortium News covers stories deeply and has been responsible for uncovering scandals and important information that was not found/covered by the mainstream media.

Analysis / Bias
Consortium News has articles that many on the right may consider left-biased:

While also having articles the left won’t like:

The reporting from Consortium News cites itself as trying to find the truth. However, I would say that they often report on things with a left-leaning focus. With articles like the above pro-minimum wage or anything regarding the environment. I can see how some on the left would feel that articles like the above or another titled “Europe May Finally Rethink NATO Costs” can come off as right-leaning. The reality is that truth has no side. Sometimes, somebody on the right is correct, and somebody on the left is wrong, and vice versa.
In reviewing dozens of articles, most hold a left-wing editorial bias, such as this
[ICC Criticized for Neglecting Probe of Israeli War Crimes](https://consortiumnews.com/2022/12/16/icc-criticized-for-neglecting-probe-of-israeli-war-crimes/). Due to advocating for Far-Left-progressive policy, they often present negative views on the Biden Administration and establishment Democrats, such as this [Biden at the UN Forgets What War Is](https://consortiumnews.com/2021/09/22/biden-at-the-un-forgets-what-war-is/).
The best way to describe Consortium News is Wikileaks, without the leaks. They reject imperialism no matter what side is controlling it. They also often do not have a favorable view of former President Trump:
[VIPS Memo to the President: Is Pompeo’s Iran Agenda the Same As Yours?](https://consortiumnews.com/2019/06/21/vips-memo-to-the-president-is-pompeos-agenda-the-same-as-yours/)
Consortium News holds strong anti-war positions, which has resulted in media credibility rater
[Newsguard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsguard/) rating them with a Red Shield, indicating they are not credible. Newsguard [cites](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/consortiumnews.com?cid=3a4359f1-aabc-41f2-bdfd-1f0c0f5c4530) the publication of false or misleading information regarding Ukraine. However, our review indicates they have not failed a fact check by a third-party IFCN fact checker. [On 10/23/2023](https://consortiumnews.com/2023/10/23/us-government-newsguard-sued-by-consortium-news/), Consortium News filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government and internet watchdog NewsGuard Technologies, accusing them of First Amendment violations and defamation.
In general, Consortium News holds strong left-leaning biases with a focus on anti-war and anti-imperialism perspectives. Most information is properly sourced, but many stories are opinion-based and sometimes cannot be proven correct or incorrect.
