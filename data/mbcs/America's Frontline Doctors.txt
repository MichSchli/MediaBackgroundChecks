History
Founded on 07/16/2020 by
[Simone Gold](https://www.americasfrontlinedoctors.com/physician-leadership) with the [domain](https://whois.domaintools.com/americasfrontlinedoctors.com) registered in Toronto, Canada, America’s Frontline Doctors is a website that consists of a group of doctors that report information on COVID-19 from a conservative perspective. The website lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page or disclose ownership; however, they give a page that lists its [leadership](https://www.americasfrontlinedoctors.com/physician-leadership), which does not contain an Epidemiologist, Immunologist, or Infectious Disease, expert. Additionally, if they have qualified physicians and researchers on staff, they are not listed on the website.
On 7/27/2020, America’s Frontline Doctors released a video claiming that Hydroxychloroquine cures Covid-19 and
[masks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) are unnecessary. Conservative news outlet [Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/27/watch-texas-doctor-studies-claiming-hydroxychloroquine-does-not-work-are-fake-science/) published a story and the video that [went viral](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/27/watch-texas-doctor-studies-claiming-hydroxychloroquine-does-not-work-are-fake-science/), reaching millions. However, on 7/28/2020, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube [removed](https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/facebook-twitter-and-youtube-remove-viral-video-of-doctors-making-false-coronavirus-claims/) the video due to the “doctors making false and dubious claims related to the coronavirus.”
Finally, in July 2021, their website went
[offline](https://www.fastcompany.com/90533570/americas-frontline-doctors-website-goes-dark-as-platforms-scramble-to-scrub-misinformation). [On 6/16/2022](https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-covid-health-california-government-and-politics-e0e72e384e0d01ff9ce1aff7173a369b), Simone Gold was sentenced to 60 days in jail for participating in the January 6th, 2021, capitol riot.

Funded by / Ownership
America’s Frontline Doctors does not disclose ownership or sponsorship. While we cannot find concrete evidence of ownership, there are indications they may be
[affiliated](https://www.teapartypatriots.org/live-broadcasts/press-conference-americas-frontline-doctors/) with the [Tea Party Patriots](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tea-party-patriots/) as they broadcast their event live. Further, it appears the founder, Dr. Simone Gold, is working directly with the Tea Party Patriots, as evidenced [here](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/hospitals-doctors-get-conservatives-push-for-elective-care): “Many Americans are avoiding or delaying routine medical care out of fear of contracting the virus, Gold said. She said that they’re working with Tea Party Patriots Action to get their message out.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website consists of sections such as Summit, Media, and Blog. For example, under “summit,” there are subsections “Summit Agenda, Leadership, Speakers, References, Testimonials” the subsection
[References](https://www.americasfrontlinedoctors.com/content) include two pdf files, “White Paper on Hydroxychloroquine,” which consists of an interview with Pseudoscience promoter [Dr. Mehmet Oz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/doctoroz-com/). The White Paper research describes Hydroxychloroquine as a safe and effective cure for Covid-19. However, according to the FDA and several [other studies](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-halts-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine), Hydroxychloroquine is [not effective ](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-revokes-emergency-use-authorization-chloroquine-and)for Covid-19.
Under the “Compendium of HCQ Studies,” they reference Dr. Daniel Wohlgelernter. His name also appears in a letter to President Trump with other conservative activists aligned with the Tea Party Patriots. You can view the letter
[here](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yfe3TLIPXKsJ:https://tpp-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/200610-TPPA-CDC-School-Considerations-Letter.pdf+&cd=13&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). The second PDF document lists Dr. Vladimir Zelenko as a source the Tea Party PAC touted.
In the video of their press conference that aired on 7/27/2020, a Pediatrician and religious minister named Stella Immanuel claimed that with Hydroxychloroquine, “You don’t need masks; there is a cure.” Both of these statements are false. As stated above, Hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment/cure for Covid-19, and mask coverings are an effective way to limit transmission.
According to
[Johns Hopkins University](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know) infectious disease expert [Lisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0009313/lisa-maragakis), “Face masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Because it’s possible to have coronavirus without showing symptoms, it is best to wear a face-covering even if you think you are healthy. A mask helps contain small droplets that come out of your mouth and/or nose when you talk, sneeze, or cough. If you have COVID-19 and are not showing symptoms, a face mask reduces your chance of spreading the infection to others.” Stella Immanuel has also made [questionable claims](https://www.thedailybeast.com/stella-immanuel-trumps-new-covid-doctor-believes-in-alien-dna-demon-sperm-and-hydroxychloroquine) in the past, such as “Endometriosis is caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches,” and that “alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments, and that scientists are creating a vaccine to prevent people from being religious.” She also claims that the government is run by “reptilians.”
In general, America’s Frontline Doctors lack credibility as none specializes in infectious diseases. Further, much of the information they present is not supported by the scientific consensus regarding Covid-19. Lastly, the group appears to be connected to the Tea Party Patriots, owned by the Tea Party Patriots Fund, which lobbies for small government and conservative causes.
