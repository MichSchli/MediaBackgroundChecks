Analysis / Bias
In review, FrontPage Magazine promotes extreme right-wing propaganda that utilizes loaded language such as this:
[LEFTISTS HAVE ALWAYS LIED ABOUT AUSCHWITZ](https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/274074/leftists-have-always-lied-about-auschwitz-danusha-v-goska). They also routinely promote President Trump’s immigration agenda such as this: [ORWELLIAN SPECTACLE OVERSHADOWS IMMIGRATION DEBATE](https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/273236/orwellian-spectacle-overshadows-immigration-debate-lawrence-lockman). The primary purpose of this website is to paint Islam followers negatively, such as this: [AMERICA’S NEWEST MUSLIM MARTYR IS A CHILD RAPIST AND KILLER](https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/272828/americas-newest-muslim-martyr-child-rapist-and-daniel-greenfield). In general, the stories published on this website serve to portray Islam in a negative light. You will never find a positive story, only murder, rape, and terror.
During 2020, Frontpage Magazine frequently promoted
[misinformation](https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/2020/05/six-impossible-things-democrats-and-media-want-you-don-feder/) regarding Coronavirus, such as this when they claimed there is no science behind wearing a [mask](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/). There is significant [evidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) to indicate a mask effectively slows the spread of covid-19. Finally, they promoted election fraud conspiracy theories such as this [A Stolen Presidential Election in the Nation’s Election Fraud Capital](https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/2020/11/stolen-presidential-election-nations-election-daniel-greenfield/). As of this date, there is [no evidence](https://apnews.com/article/top-officials-elections-most-secure-66f9361084ccbc461e3bbf42861057a5) to suggest there was widespread fraud or that the election was stolen. This is a classic propaganda and conspiracy website that many [take seriously](https://video.foxnews.com/v/5354247866001/#sp=show-clips).
