Analysis / Bias
Lockdowns were globally implemented to combat the threat of COVID-19, prioritizing public safety, healthcare system stability, and vaccine
[research](https://www.who.int/teams/blueprint/covid-19). Contrarily, [“Identity Destruction”](https://endlockdowns.org/identity-destruction/) on endlockdowns.org mischaracterizes lockdowns as torture, drawing misleading historical parallels. The article cites works on torture, such as those by Lone Jacobson and Pieter Kooijmans, without direct in-text references. This approach can give the impression of a well-researched argument, even though the references don’t directly support the claims about COVID-19 and lockdowns.
This false referencing can skew the narrative and mislead readers into believing that the article’s claims have a solid foundation when, in reality, the cited works do not pertain to the pandemic response. Moreover, the site features content from figures like
[Steve Kirsch](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Steve%20Kirsch), who transitioned from a pro-vaccine stance to labeling vaccines “toxic.” His radical views led to professional dissociations and resignations from roles at M10 and CETF. Kirsch’s inclusion, especially when [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/05/1036408/silicon-valley-millionaire-steve-kirsch-covid-vaccine-misinformation/) refers to him as a “misinformation superspreader,” accentuates the site’s bias.
In addition, the article
[“The Vaccine Agenda](https://endlockdowns.org/vaccine-agenda/)” aligns with conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 vaccines. It suggests a hidden or nefarious agenda behind vaccination campaigns, implies that the vaccines may have harmful effects, and questions the motivations of health organizations and governments promoting vaccination. This content contributes to the site’s promotion of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 and vaccines, undermining the established scientific consensus on the benefits of vaccination in controlling the pandemic. The article also includes videos referencing individuals such as [Anne McCloskey](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65953976), [Karen Kingston](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-graphene-lipidvaccines/fact-check-no-evidence-graphene-oxide-is-present-in-available-covid-19-vaccines-via-lipid-nanoparticles-idUSL1N2PI2XH), [Dr. Zelenko](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/vladimir-zelenko-dead.html), and [Robert Malone,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/malone-institute-bias/) known figures who have expressed anti-vaccine views, nonconventional treatments for COVID-19, and failed fact checks. [Anne McCloskey](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65953976), in particular, was suspended from her medical profession.
