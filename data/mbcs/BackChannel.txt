Analysis / Bias
BackChannel (BC) is a technology reporting site that reports primarily on the internet and social media. The articles on the site are factual and well-sourced. What political news BC carries is tech-centric, such as the article concerning Ajit Pai, President Trump’s pick to head the FCC. While the reporting on BC is solid, there is a slightly left bias in the overall tone. Much of that bias is inherent in the subject matter, but it doesn’t account for all of it. For this reason, Back Channel is rated Left Center.
