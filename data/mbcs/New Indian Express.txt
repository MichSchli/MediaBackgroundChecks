Analysis / Bias
The New Indian Express often uses moderately loaded emotional language in its reporting, such as in the article
[“PM Modi doubles down on women empowerment.”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/mar/09/pm-modi-doubles-downon-women-empowerment-2554475.html) This article does not contain hyperlinks and sources its information from the Prime Minister’s speech, experts, and the event itself without relying on additional sources or commentary. The article presents the news in a straightforward manner.
However, the article titled “
[How much money did Adani give to BJP?’: Rahul tears into the BJP government”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/feb/07/how-much-money-did-adani-give-to-bjp-rahul-tears-into-the-bjp-government-2545251.html) contains emotionally loaded language in the headline, which uses the phrase “tears into” to describe Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the BJP government. The body of the article presents the response of the accused party, BJP, to the allegations made by Rahul Gandhi without specifically refuting them. The article appears to contain a bias against the BJP government and is critical of their financial relationship with Adani Group. The article sources direct quotes from both Rahul Gandhi and BJP leaders.
On the other hand, the article titled
[“Caring, Sharing in Ramadan: ‘Sehri,’ ‘Iftar’ for fasting Muslims in Hospitals,”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/apr/11/caring-sharing-in-ramadan-sehri-iftar-for-fasting-muslims-in-hospitals-2564868.html) presents a positive story about a local NGO’s efforts to provide sehri and iftar meals to Muslim patients in hospitals in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The article quotes the NGO’s founder and hospital staff to provide additional information. It presents a positive narrative about efforts to care for the needs of Muslim patients during Ramadan without taking any political or social stance.
Regarding news about the USA, articles such as
[“Trump’s Indictment is a Double-Edged Sword for Global Order.”](https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2023/apr/03/trumps-indictment-is-a-double-edged-sword-for-global-order-2562029.html) contain biased language with negative tones towards former president Trump. For example, the article refers to Trump’s policies as “hair-brained sanctions” and describes him as a “foul-mouthing narcissist.” The publication thoroughly sources its international news from the White House, state.gov, [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), and [the New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Council on Foreign Relations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-on-foreign-relations/), and [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/).
In general, they hold a left-leaning editorial bias and usually present fact-based information with poor sourcing techniques.
