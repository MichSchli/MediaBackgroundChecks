Analysis / Bias
Gundry MD’s products and promotional materials often veer into pseudoscience and alternative medicine. Dr. Gundry has been criticized for promoting dietary approaches that lack strong scientific evidence and making unverified claims about his products’ health benefits. While some dietary advice may be harmless or beneficial for some individuals, other claims made by Gundry MD lack sufficient scientific backing or may be misleading to consumers.
Dr. Gundry promotes the idea that lectins found in many foods are harmful. He claims that these compounds cause inflammation and weight gain and contribute to several health issues. However, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims.
[Dr. Harriet Hall,](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-plant-paradox-steven-gundrys-war-on-lectins/) a retired family physician known for her skepticism toward pseudoscience, highlights the lack of definitive evidence supporting Gundry’s assertions about lectins and questions the safety and efficacy of following his restrictive dietary advice. A [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) Health [article ](https://www.forbes.com/health/nutrition/lectin-free-diet/)authored by Dylan Bailey, M.S., R.D., F.A.N.D., and reviewed by Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.E., C.D.N., examines the controversy surrounding lectin-free diets linked to Dr. Steven Gundry’s work. While some tout benefits, scientific evidence for completely eliminating lectins is scant. Critics warn of potential health risks due to nutrient deficiencies and unhealthy eating patterns.
Furthermore, Dr. Gundry monetizes his platform by selling various
[products](https://gundrymd.com/shop/lectin-free-food/), including Polyphenol-Rich Olive Oil, ProPlant Complete Shake, and Coconut Chocolate Bars, among others. These items are marketed with exaggerated health benefits and varying price points, raising questions about the objectivity of his health advice given his financial interests in promoting certain products.
In addition to promoting pseudoscience and questionable dietary advice, Dr. Steven Gundry has authored a study questioning the safety of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, drawing criticism and an
[“expression of concern”](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/964315?form=fpf) from the American Heart Association (A.H.A.). While the study’s conclusions have faced scrutiny, its existence suggests a stance that could align with anti-vaccine sentiments.
In general, as a result of his promotion of pseudoscience, unsubstantiated health claims, and involvement in controversial studies, Dr. Gundry’s credibility comes into question.
