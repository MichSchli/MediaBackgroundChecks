Analysis / Bias
In review, The Australian publishes news with story selection that moderately favors the right. There is the moderate use of loaded language such as this:
[‘Democracy put in danger,’](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/media-chiefs-urge-government-to-overhaul-laws-to-protect-journalists-and-whistleblowers/news-story/8a902db71c91745c2dd3904dc60dfce6) and [ABC ‘wants to skate over socialist failure’ in Venezuela](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-uds-cse&cx=012148326047351459851:t-0dbr0qusq&q=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/video/id-5348771529001-6051584968001/abc-wants-to-skate-over-socialist-failure-in-venezuela&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjGu6XO64fjAhUNzoUKHUwkCU8QFjAGegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw3hjckHdsA6qihDfZkLbalK). The Australian also integrates content from overseas newspapers owned by News Corp Australia’s international parent News Corp, including the right-leaning [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/) and [The Times of London](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/). Editorially, there is a distinct conservative bias in topic positions. Further, they often minimize and question the consensus of science on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), as evidenced by the failed fact check below.
Finally, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 55% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 17% do not, ranking them #8 in trust of the major Australian news providers.
