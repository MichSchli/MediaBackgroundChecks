Analysis / Bias
The first article reviewed,
[“Gunmen abduct two in Jalingo,”](https://dailypost.ng/2023/09/10/gunmen-abduct-two-in-jalingo/) discusses the abduction of two individuals in Jalingo, Taraba State, by an unknown gunman. The article is factual and straightforward, quoting the spokesperson of the Taraba State Police Command for confirmation. It also includes anonymous residents’ opinions urging the governor to address the recurring attacks.
The second article,
[“100 days in office: Security experts pass verdict on Tinubu govt,”](https://dailypost.ng/2023/09/10/100-days-in-office-security-experts-pass-verdict-on-tinubu-govt/) discusses President Bola Tinubu’s first 100 days in office and Nigeria’s security situation. The article presents divergent views from security experts on whether the security situation has improved under President Tinubu. It quotes both sides, maintaining a balanced perspective.
Lastly,
[“President election court: Atiku, Obi fight on as Tinubu, Buhari, Ganduje hail judgment”](https://dailypost.ng/2023/09/07/president-election-court-atiku-obi-fight-on-as-tinubu-buhari-ganduje-hail-judgement/) discusses the reactions of various political parties and figures to a court judgment on the presidential election. The article includes quotes from both sides, including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Congress (APC), and the Labour Party (LP), presenting a balanced view. While the article strives for balance by including quotes from both sides, the absence of external verification for these quotes raises questions about their credibility.
Based on the articles reviewed, Daily Post Nigeria maintains a neutral tone in its reporting. However, the lack of external hyperlinks for verification affects its factual reporting rating.
