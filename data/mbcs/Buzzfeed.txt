Analysis / Bias
BuzzFeed often publishes “Listicles” with images or GIFs and short content with links such as
[“100 Pictures That’ll Make You Pee Yourself Laughing”](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexnaidus/literally-just-100-funny-pictures) or [“42 Cat GIFs Guaranteed To Make You Laugh Every Time”.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseamarshall/funny-cat-gifs) They also publish [viral videos](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/viral_video) and political news on their [news website](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/).
In a review of their reporting of news stories, Buzzfeed utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines
[“Trump Excluded Democrats From A Lunch Meeting On The Shutdown”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lissandravilla/shutdown-government-trump-white-house) and [“The US Envoy On ISIS, Brett McGurk, Quit In Protest Over Trump’s Withdrawal From Syria](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/brett-mcgurk-resigns-trump-syria).” They typically source to themselves when it comes to sourcing; however, they also utilize credible sources such as the [Des Moines Register](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-des-moines-register/) and [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Further, they do not clearly label opinion pieces, making it difficult to distinguish between straight news content and editorials. In general, most Buzzfeed stories favor the left.
In January 2017, Buzzfeed published the Steele Dossier about alleged Russia collusion, which caused former President Donald Trump to
[criticize](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-presser-slams-buzzfeed-233483) them by saying Buzzfeed is a ‘failing pile of garbage. In December 2018, according to Politico, “ [The libel case over the dossier it published before Trump took office gets tossed.”](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/12/22/week-83-buzzfeed-takes-a-victory-lap-223556)
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/buzzfeed/) found that 59% of Buzzfeed’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 27% Mixed, and 14% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers Buzzfeed.
