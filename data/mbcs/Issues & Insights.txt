History
[Founded in 2019](https://whois.domaintools.com/issuesinsights.com), Issues & Insights or I&I are a Libertarian-leaning news and opinion website. According to their [about page](https://issuesinsights.com/about-us/), “This site was started by the team that for decades had produced IBD Editorials at [Investor’s Business Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/investors-business-daily/). Unlike other pundits and media celebrities, we do the hard work of reporting and researching stories before we offer our uncompromising viewpoints on them.” They further state, “We are unapologetically pro-free market and for a limited federal government.” A list of their editorial board can be found [here](https://issuesinsights.com/about-us/).

[Real Clear Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-politics/), I&I is funded through reader donations and advertising that is evident on each page.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Issues & Insights reports news and commentary through guest authors and opinion pieces written by members of their editorial board. Most editorial board members are from the strongly right-leaning Investor’s Business Daily, which does not have a positive record with fact-checkers. Guest articles typically contain moderately loaded emotional language, such as this
[FDA Plays Defense On COVID-19 Vaccine Approvals](https://issuesinsights.com/2020/08/10/fda-plays-defense-on-covid-19-vaccine-approvals/). This article is sourced from credible media outlets such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), and the FDA.
Story selection always favors the right and frequently denigrates the left such as this:
[Democrats’ Scorched-Earth Tactics Should Stop at the Virus’ Edge. (But Won’t)](https://issuesinsights.com/2020/08/04/democrats-scorched-earth-tactics-should-stop-at-the-virus-edge-but-wont/). When it comes to sourcing I&I always provides links to support their claims. However, some of the sources they utilize have very poor track records with fact-checkers such as [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/), [Hot Air](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/hot-air/), and [Rush Limbaugh](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/).
Editorially, all opinions tend to favor a libertarian/conservative perspective. For example, many articles harshly criticize the left, such as this
[No Doubt About It: Democrats Are Part Of The Riot Problem](https://issuesinsights.com/2020/08/06/no-doubts-now-that-the-democrats-are-part-of-the-riot-problem/), while frequently reporting favorably on former President Trump [The Facts About Trump That Are Deadly For Democrats](https://issuesinsights.com/2020/02/12/the-facts-about-trump-that-are-deadly-for-democrats/).
When it comes to science, they sometimes publish misleading information regarding
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) that does not support the consensus, such as this: [A Short List Of Facts Global Warming Alarmists Don’t Want To Face](https://issuesinsights.com/2019/08/26/a-short-list-of-facts-global-warming-alarmists-dont-want-to-face/). Further, throughout the Covid-19 outbreak of 2020, they have offered information that downplays the mortality of the disease [The Big Surge In Coronavirus Deaths Is A Media-Fed Myth](https://issuesinsights.com/2020/07/22/the-big-surge-in-coronavirus-deaths-is-a-media-fed-myth/). In general, news reporting and editorials consistently favor the right, while some information is misleading or false.
