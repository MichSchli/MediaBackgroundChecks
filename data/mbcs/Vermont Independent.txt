History
The Vermont Independent is a Left-Libertarian blog affiliated with the
[Second Vermont Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vermont_Republic), a secessionist group within the U.S. state of Vermont. Their mission in 2017 is to “restore the formerly independent status of the [Vermont Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_Republic) (1777–91).” It describes itself as “a nonviolent citizens’ network and think tank opposed to the tyranny of Corporate America and the U.S. government, and committed to the peaceful return of Vermont to its status as an independent republic and more broadly the dissolution of the Union.”
As of 2021, they do not have an about page or any other information that details ownership or an editor.

Analysis / Bias
The Vermont Independent publishes news and opinion pieces, with the majority being opinion pieces related to secession. Due to the many opinion pieces, there is minimal sourcing; therefore, we rate them Low for factual reporting. The wording is not inflammatory; however, they are left biased based on the reasoning for wanting to secede, such as anti-corporatism and anti-imperialism.
The above review is from 2017, and this is a great illustration of how a source can change in a short period of time. The Vermont Independent is a conspiracy website promoting anti-vaccination propaganda like this
[Viral Tyranny, Transhumanism, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (UNLIMITED HANGOUT)](https://vermontindependent.net/viral-tyranny-transhumanism-and-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-unlimited-hangout/). The source of this information is the highly discredited RFK Jr and his [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/) pseudoscience website, which promotes debunked information on vaccines and science in general.
They also promote geoengineering and nonsense such as chemtrails found
