[100 Percent Fed Up](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/100-percent-fed-up/). Articles and headlines frequently use loaded emotional language that favors the right and denigrate the left, such as this [Flashback To When Kamala Harris Vowed To Implement Extreme Gun Control Comes Back To Haunt Her- Vote For TRUMP](https://breakingfirst.com/flashback-to-when-kamala-harris-vowed/) and this [Slow Joe Biden Says He Will Completely STOP Building Of Wall If Elected President, “There will not be another foot of wall construction in my administration”](https://breakingfirst.com/biden-says-he-will-completely-stop-building-wall/).
