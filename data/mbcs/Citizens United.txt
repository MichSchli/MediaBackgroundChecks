Analysis / Bias
In review, Citizens United is best known for the Supreme Court case
[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission). This is a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning [campaign finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States). The Court held that the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations, including nonprofit corporations, labor unions, and other associations. Put in its simplest terms, it determined that money is a form of free speech protected by the Constitution.
Citizens United also runs campaign ads in support of Republicans and opposed to Democrats, as well as creating documentaries opposed to Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Further, the website publishes news that is highly biased against any politician that is not deemed conservative enough
