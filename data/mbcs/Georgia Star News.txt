History
The Georgia Star News is a news and opinion website with a right-leaning bias in reporting. According to their
[about page](https://thevirginiastar.com/about-us-va/), “We feature articles reporting news, politics, and policy at the state level, primarily from George. We round out our daily coverage with national stories and thoughtful commentary of interest to our readers.” According to an investigation by [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/03/04/activists-setup-local-news-sites/), The Georgia Star News is not a local newspaper but rather a front for “Tea Party-connected conservative activists: Michael Patrick Leahy and Christina Botteri.” Snopes details connections to conservative donors and PACS as well.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Georgia Star News presents news with a conservative bias through story selection that usually favors the right. All articles are properly sourced and generally use credible mainstream sources. There is some use of loaded words within news stories, but not excessive.
Editorially, the Georgia Star News has a strong right-leaning bias with frequent use of strong, emotionally loaded words that favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this
[Commentary: The Left’s New Scheme That Threatens Free Elections](https://georgiastarnews.com/2023/01/29/commentary-the-lefts-new-scheme-that-threatens-free-elections/). Although The Georgia Star News is right-biased and generally factual, we cannot rate them High for factual reporting due to the source being exposed as a political activism website attempting to look like a local paper. For this reason, we rate them factually Mixed based on a lack of transparency and the promotion of propaganda.
