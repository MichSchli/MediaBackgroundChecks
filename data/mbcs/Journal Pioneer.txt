The Journal Pioneer has a right-center bias in reporting as many stories
[slightly favor the right](https://www.saltwire.com/cape-breton/news/update-ns-fuel-update-aug-5-2022-gas-diesel-prices-drop-interrupter-clause-to-be-invoked-100760572/). When reporting world news, they typically use [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and with national news, they use [Postmedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ottawa-sun/) publications, which lean right.
Opinion and editorial pieces also slightly favor the right such as this
[Illegal crossings threaten Canadaâ€™s successful immigration policy](https://www.saltwire.com/prince-edward-island/opinion/bill-black-illegal-crossings-threaten-canadas-successful-immigration-policy-100776189/). However, news reporting is usually accurate and holds a slight conservative bias.
