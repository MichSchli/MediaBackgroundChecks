Analysis / Bias
InvestigateWest focuses on in-depth investigative journalism, addressing critical regional issues. This analysis examines their work for bias, the evidence cited, and ideological leanings.
The opening line of the first article, titled “
[How a New Idaho Superintendent is Tapping Far-right Connections to Refashion a School District](https://www.invw.org/2023/07/26/how-a-new-idaho-superintendent-is-tapping-far-right-connections-to-refashion-a-school-district/),” suggests a left-leaning bias by portraying right-wing politics negatively and uses emotionally loaded language such as “Teachers flee the small district, fearing the impact of a right-wing politician’s appointment.” However, the article maintains factual accuracy, drawing from credible sources like [Idaho Statesman](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/idaho-statesman/), [KTVB – Boise News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ktvb-boise-news-bias/), [Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), [Coeur d’Alene Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/coeur-dalene-press-bias/), [The Republican (Masslive.com](https://www.masslive.com/news/boston/2017/09/massachusetts_internet_troll_t.html) and [Anti-Defamation League (ADL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/).
In the piece
[“Biden’s Administration is Still Denying Immigrants Citizenship for Working in legal cannabis,”](https://www.invw.org/2023/12/23/bidens-administration-is-still-denying-immigrants-citizenship-for-working-in-legal-cannabis/) the title contains emotionally loaded language and carries a critical tone towards the Biden administration’s policies. This critical perspective, primarily when directed at a Democratic administration, does not straightforwardly align with traditional liberal bias. The article’s focus on immigrants’ challenges in the context of legal cannabis and its criticism of current policies suggest a concern for immigrant rights and drug policy reform. These topics are typically associated with liberal viewpoints. However, the article’s critical stance towards the Biden administration demonstrates a willingness to hold leaders accountable, regardless of their political affiliation, a hallmark of balanced journalism. Regarding sourcing, it effectively cites evidence from real-life cases, legal expert opinions, and statements from U.S. senators and immigration advocates. It maintains balance by presenting varied viewpoints and sourcing from dhs.gov, Wyden.senate.gov, boyle.house.gov, and cannabis.colorado.gov.
Generally, InvestigateWest leans left in its editorial stance and framing and consistently supports its reports with credible sources.
