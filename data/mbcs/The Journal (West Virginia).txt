Analysis / Bias
In review, The Journal produces original news covering most of West Virginia. Headlines and articles contain minimal emotional language such as this:
[Justice stands by state board decision to take away remote learning option](https://www.journal-news.net/journal-news/justice-stands-by-state-board-decision-to-take-away-remote-learning-option/article_c7da55e8-44db-569a-91b9-0033d2ec2acb.html). National and international news is republished from the [Associated Press.](https://www.post-journal.com/news/local-news/2019/10/police-investigating-saturday-stabbing/)
Editorially, the paper does not endorse Presidential candidates, however, in local elections, they tend to favor more Republican candidates. A review of editorial commentary shows a reasonable balance between right and left without delving into extremes, however slightly more op-ed’s favor the right. In general, the news is reported factually with a slight conservative bias editorially.
