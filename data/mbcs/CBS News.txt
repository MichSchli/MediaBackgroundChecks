Analysis / Bias
CBS News is considered a mainstream USA media source that reports news with a left-leaning bias in story selection. In other words, they are more likely to report on a story that is
[favorable to the left](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-republicans-withdraw-endorsement/) or more [critical of the right](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/live-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-testifies-on-trump-putin-summit-live-stream/). However, they always source their information correctly and cover both sides of stories. The wording of headlines utilizes minimal loaded words such as this: [Trump denies advance knowledge of son’s meeting with Russian lawyer.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-denies-knowing-about-trump-tower-meeting-contradicting-what-cohen-is-willing-to-tell-mueller/)
