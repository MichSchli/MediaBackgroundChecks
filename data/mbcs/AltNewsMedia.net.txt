[about page](https://altnewsmedia.net/about-us/), “ALTNEWSMEDIA provides an alternative to the fake news mainstream media narrative.

The website also promotes conspiracy theories such as this [‘Whoever Controls The Media, Controls The Mind](https://www.altnewsmedia.net/news/whoever-controls-the-media-controls-the-mind/).’ Further, they have spread false or misleading information concerning Covid-19 (see below)
