Analysis / Bias
[Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/china) states, “President Xi Jinping has succeeded in imposing a social model in China based on control of news and information and online surveillance of its citizens. At the same time, he has been trying to export this oppressive model by promoting a “new world media order” under China’s influence” According to their 2020 report, China ranks 175 out of 180, which equates to almost zero press freedom.
According to
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), CCTV International (CCTV-9) is a part of the global [“soft power”](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-cctv/chinas-cctv-launches-global-soft-power-media-network-to-extend-influence-idUSL4N1EQ03S) launched by CCTV to extend its influence. This is to “follow the party line and promote “positive propaganda as the main theme.”
Most articles about the Communist Government are favorable with zero criticism of President Xi Jinping. In other words, the content you find on the website is generally factual and neutral in tone. Still, the consistent bias by omission makes CCTV International a factually Mixed propaganda source. For example,
[“Xi underlines winning anti-poverty battle during Ningxia inspection.”](https://english.cctv.com/2020/06/11/ARTIk2Yo0sgw4bNaZywtrCVV200611.shtml?spm=C69523.PDoRdCIUTBov.EiFD0kE9SqhK.51) and [“Xi’s Yellow River tour a boost to ecological protection, high-quality development.”](https://english.cctv.com/2020/06/10/ARTIv8Ma32CtrHonEFbPAneb200610.shtml?spm=C43394269523.P90451422862.EUH7LNrtbQHG.10) Further, they exclusively utilize the factually mixed Chinese state-run press agency [Xinhua News Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/xinhua-news-agency/).
When reporting USA news, CCTV International (CCTV-9) utilizes minimally loaded words in their articles, and they do present low biased coverage of USA news (when it is US-related news)
[“George Floyd’s brother testifies before U.S. Congress as police reform becomes partisan issue](https://english.cctv.com/2020/06/11/ARTIxM2vRnzL15DbijUSLkKe200611.shtml?spm=C69523.P89601117162.EEy8zkAGlNk4.32).” However, they favor China when it is related to state affairs: [China rebukes Pompeo’s swipe at HSBC backing national security legislation”.](https://english.cctv.com/2020/06/11/ARTIuCvyzo9eJCAyKrihrjS2200611.shtml?spm=C69523.PDoRdCIUTBov.EiFD0kE9SqhK.44) The news is generally reported factually; however, it is misleading due to strong censorship of anything negative toward China.
