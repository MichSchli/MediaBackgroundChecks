History
Earth First! is a radical environmental advocacy group that emerged in the Southwestern United States in 1979. Earth First was the group responsible for tree spiking in the late 80s and early 90s that resulted in an injury when a saw blade shattered. Earth First continues to use sabotage tactics to “protect” the earth; however, they now have a policy of making sure humans will not be injured.
