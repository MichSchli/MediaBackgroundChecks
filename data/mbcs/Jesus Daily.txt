[Dr. Aaron Tabor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtabor?trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.123201_net.mediapartner_plc.adgoal%20GmbH_pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Jesus Daily publishes inspirational Christian stories such as this:
[This Nurse Comforted a New Patient, but You Won’t Believe Who He Really Was.](https://www.jesusdaily.com/nurse-comforted-new-patient-wont-believe-really/) They also publish stories giving Christians advice such as this: [7 Steps For Improving Your Prayer Life](https://www.jesusdaily.com/7-steps-for-improving-your-prayer-life-jsh/). Other stories are related to health such as this: [Signs that Cancer is Growing In Your Body](https://www.jesusdaily.com/signs-that-cancer-is-growing-in-your-body/). While the information in this article may be true, there is zero sourcing to back it up, other than Dr. Tabor’s word. Further, Jesus Daily promotes miracle foods without providing a single source of evidence to back the claims, such as this: [Combat Hypothyroidism And Feel Better With This Miracle Recipe](https://www.jesusdaily.com/combat-hypothyroidism-feel-better-miracle-recipe/). A search of Dr. Tabor’s Revival Soy brand shows they are not accepted by the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/us/nc/kernersville/profile/health-products/physicians-laboratories-0503-12000648) and a search for [scientific studies](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00352157) shows there are None in the Last 5 years that demonstrate its efficacy.
In general, Jesus Daily publishes unsubstantiated stories that lack proper sourcing. They also do not publish political news.
