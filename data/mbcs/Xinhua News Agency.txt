History
Founded in 1931, Xinhua News Agency, or New China News Agency, is the official state-owned news agency in the People’s Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency’s headquarter is located in Beijing. Xinhua News Agency provides daily coverage of business, politics, economics, sport, sci-tech, culture, etc.
[Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/china) have reported China as the “World’s leading prison for citizen journalists.” According to their 2023 report, China ranks 177 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
Funded by / Ownership
Xinhua is owned by the People’s Republic of China and is funded by selling its news content, similar to
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). They lack transparency as they do not disclose they are an arm of the government.
Analysis / Bias
The content of headlines and articles use minimal loaded words about national news such as
[“Xi stresses real combat training”](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/03/c_136870001.htm) or “ [Xi says senior officials “crucial” in Party, state governance](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/05/c_136874622.htm).” Their US coverage also utilizes minimally loaded headlines and least biased but selective pro-Chinese coverage [“Analysis: U.S.-DPRK relations to be Trump’s biggest 2018 foreign policy challenge, experts say.”](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/05/c_136875136.htm) Although they completely lack linked sourcing, they provide credible sources, such as [Brookings Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brookings-institute/), [Stratfor](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stratfor/), and [Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress,](http://www.thepresidency.org/) through quotes.
According to a
[Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/) article, [“IS CHINA’S XINHUA THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM?](http://www.newsweek.com/chinas-xinhua-future-journalism-71961)” By opening more overseas bureaus and expanding its business, Xinhua News Agency is similar to what “China’s state-run factories have done for tawdry baubles and cheap clothes: take something that has become a commodity and foist it onto the world far more cheaply than anyone else can. “It gives them an inherent competitive advantage.”
Further, according to
[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/17/chinese-media-xinhua-mocks-indians-and-pm-narendra-modis-policies-in-racist-video.html), in 2017, Xinhua News Agency mocked Indians by releasing a satirical video named the “Seven Sins of India.” The Chinese government has also [banned certain words](https://supchina.com/2017/08/01/words-chinese-state-media-banned/) that the media can use in reporting.
Editorially, there is a strong left-wing bias with the endorsement of
[economic socialism](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-10/18/c_136689652.htm) and pro-Government propaganda. Furthermore, Xinhua cannot seem to [glorify Xi Jinping](https://www.google.com/search?q=xinhua+Xi+Jinping&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS797US797&oq=xinhua+Xi+Jinping&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.6144j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) enough. In other words, they frequently promote government propaganda and are heavily censored.
