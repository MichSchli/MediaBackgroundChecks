Their mission is guided by four main areas of focus: energy security, economic development, environmental awareness, and engagement worldwide.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the IEA produces scientific studies that could easily place this source in our
[Pro-Science](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pro-science/) category. They also report energy-based news that is well-sourced and factual. The IEA has a slight left political bias in affiliation regarding concern for human-caused [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Despite this, all information is presented in neutral wording and is grounded in evidence; therefore, we consider the IEA least biased.
