Funded by / Ownership
Al Arabiya is owned by the Saudi broadcaster
[Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC)](https://www.mbc.net/en/corporate/about-us.html), which also owns satellite TV channels. According to [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), in 2018, [Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-media-ceo/saudi-backed-media-group-mbc-hires-new-ceo-after-veteran-leaves-idUSL8N28J1UO) launched a corruption operation and acquired 60% of founder Waleed al-Ibrahim’s shares of the Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC). Al Ibrahim retained 40% of his shares and his capacity as chairman. [The Financial Times ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/) [reports](https://www.ft.com/content/a50075d2-0069-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5) that this crackdown “hints that Prince Mohammed is tightening the government’s grip on the media.”
Analysis / Bias
According to a
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) profile on [Saudi Arabia’s media](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14703480) “Criticism of the government and royal family and the questioning of Islamic tenets are not generally tolerated. Self-censorship is pervasive.”
In review, Al Arabiya publishes articles with strong, emotionally loaded language such as
[“Troublemaker vs. Superpower: Iran’s absurd claim of power equivalence with US.”](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2020/06/01/Troublemaker-vs-Superpower-Iran-s-absurd-claim-of-power-equivalence-with-US.html) Al Arabia reports selectively when the issue doesn’t resonate with the King. For example, when reporting on Trump’s statement regarding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, they [published](https://www.dw.com/en/the-khashoggi-case-arab-media-omit-uncomfortable-facts/a-46400506) only the part of the speech where it didn’t offend Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. On issues such as women’s rights, Al Arabiya reports with a pro-reform stance [“How Saudi Arabia has increased female employment, and why the country benefits.”](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2019/08/12/How-Saudi-Arabia-has-increased-female-employment-and-why-the-country-benefits-)
When it comes to sourcing, Al Arabiya often hyperlinks to itself and republishes news from
[Reuters.](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2020/06/02/US-military-increases-protection-at-Pentagon-bases-in-Washington-DC.html) Al Arabiya also utilizes credible sources such as [weforum.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/), and uchicago.edu. When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a positive tone [“Ivanka Trump praises progress made by Saudi Arabia in gender equality”.](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2020/01/17/Ivanka-Trump-praises-progress-made-by-Saudi-Arabia-in-gender-equality) In general, the news that is presented is factual; however, it is heavily censored by the government to not portray Saudi Arabia and especially the Crown Prince in a negative light. Therefore, we rate them as a very strong propaganda source.
