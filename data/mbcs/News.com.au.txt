When it comes to issues such as
[global warming](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), they publish articles with a neutral tone such as this: [“Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases special report on global warming targets,”](https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/climate-change/intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change-due-to-release-special-report/news-story/0b0081ca1272f7cde1cac0ac74cab57d) and with racism, they criticize members of the center-right political party, Young Liberals (Australia) for racist comments they made in the video [“Two Gold Coast Young Liberals in hot water after posting racist slur video online.”](https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/politics/two-gold-coast-young-liberals-in-hot-water-after-posting-racist-slur-video-online/news-story/9428d461d838322e9f63578a19d2ba14)

[“Camila Cabello ‘sorry’ and ‘ashamed’ over past racist language.”](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrities-gone-bad/camila-cabello-sorry-and-ashamed-over-past-racist-language/news-story/f212592a50754eb842e93fa9ad9c829f) When News.com.au covers news regarding the USA, they publish articles with emotionally loaded headlines and a pro-Trump tone, [for example](https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/americas-media-celebrates-merry-impeachmas/news-story/ed24554f0695ebdac8d43a0ff7565be2), “America’s media celebrates ‘Merry Impeachmas’ The media’s gleeful reaction to Donald Trump’s impeachment may very well help him get re-elected in 2020, commentators argue.” For this story, they source factually mixed right biased sources such as [newsbusters.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsbusters/), mostly factual [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and mixed [Fox News.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) Newscorp owns the latter two sources. In general, they report news mostly factually, with story selection slightly favoring the right. They do not clearly label opinion content.
