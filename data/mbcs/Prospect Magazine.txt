Analysis / Bias
In review, Prospect Magazine is geared toward an educated reader with many articles exceeding 1000+ words that are highly detailed. Story selection often moderately favors the left and utilizes loaded headlines such as this:
[Constitutional vandalism is inherent to the Johnson-Cummings project](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/constitutional-vandalism-is-inherent-to-the-johnson-cummings-project-law-courts-parliament-conservative-manifesto). This story is appropriately sourced. Politically, Prospect Magazine is opposed to [Brexit](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/take-it-from-the-swiss-the-brexit-referendum-wasnt-legitimate), believes [climate change](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-global-fightback-against-trumps-climate-change-policy-has-only-just-begun) is a threat, and reports negatively on conservative Prime Minister [Boris Johnson](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/how-is-boris-johnson-getting-away-with-it-brexit-general-election-12-december).
When reporting on USA politics, they have a very negative view of former President Donald Trump, such as this:
[Donald Trumpâ€™s America: Welcome to the void](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/donald-trump-america-void-us-presidential-election-result). In general, Prospect Magazine reports news factually with moderate left editorial bias.
