Analysis / Bias
In review, the Edmonton Journal reports local and regional news through journalists with minimal loaded words such as this:
[Man fined $8,000 for illegal access of 81 health records](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/man-fined-8000-for-illegal-access-of-81-health-records). The national news is derived primarily from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), whereas world news comes from multiple sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Generally, straight news reporting is factual and presents minimal biased wording; however, story selection tends to lean right.
Editorially, there is a clear right-leaning bias with commentaries such as this:
[David Staples: Elizabeth May has a disastrous plan — and an outside shot at implementing it](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/david-staples-elizabeth-may-has-a-disastrous-plan-and-an-outside-shot-at-implementing-it) and this [Editorial: UCP’s mandate isn’t turning back the clock](https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-ucps-mandate-isnt-turning-back-clock). While the Edmonton Journal does offer opposing viewpoints, on the whole, more editorials favor the conservative right.
