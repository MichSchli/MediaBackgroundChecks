Analysis / Bias
In review, the Ukrayinska Pravda utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“How Paul Manafort Brought US Politics to Ukraine (and Ukrainian Politics to the US).”](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2016/08/18/7118057/) A quote from the article reads, “It turned out that our ‘good old’ corruption can influence US presidential elections! After the Yanukovych cash scandal, the US media voiced a number of concerns about Manafort and his boss.” They also publish articles that are critical of Right-Leaning Nationalist President Zelensky, such as [“Who is mister Zelensky?”](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2019/04/10/7211804/) and [“White spots on Zelensky’s anti-corruption map.”](https://www.pravda.com.ua/columns/2020/05/21/7252488/) In general, editorial positions favor the left, such as this [Three nuts from Zelensky: how the president proposes to save Ukrainian business](https://www.epravda.com.ua/publications/2020/11/27/668508/).
