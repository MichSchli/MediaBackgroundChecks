Analysis / Bias
In review, the primary function of the DNC is to advocate, fund, and promote Democratic candidates for all levels of office. The bias of the DNC is obvious; they favor the Democratic party and their platform. However, progressive-leaning candidates and media organizations have accused the DNC of supporting centrist, establishment, and pro-corporate candidates:
[Tom Perez Stacks the DNC Deck Against Progressives](https://newrepublic.com/article/156341/tom-perez-stacks-dnc-deck-progressives).
The DNC website also publishes news from a moderately liberal perspective that frequently uses loaded emotional language such as this
[Trump’s Mismanagement Continues To Make The Crisis Worse](https://democrats.org/news/trumps-mismanagement-continues-to-make-the-crisis-worse/) and this [In Latest Briefing, Trump Lies About His Coronavirus Response](https://democrats.org/news/in-latest-briefing-trump-lies-about-his-coronavirus-response/). Generally, the news reported is well sourced to credible media outlets such as the [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). However, statements made by the DNC have a poor track record with fact-checking.
