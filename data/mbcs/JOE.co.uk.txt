Analysis / Bias
In review, JOE.co.uk publishes listicles such as
[Revealed: The top 30 breakup songs](https://www.joe.co.uk/life/revealed-the-top-30-breakup-songs-361217). They also cover a variety of topics, including politics, most often with emotionally loaded language such as [Joe Biden to pardon everyone convicted on federal marijuana possession charges](https://www.joe.co.uk/news/joe-biden-to-pardon-everyone-convicted-on-federal-marijuana-possession-charges-362386) and [Tory MP tells struggling Brits to ‘cut back or get a better job.’](https://www.joe.co.uk/news/tory-mp-tells-struggling-brits-to-cut-back-or-get-better-job-361607)
Editorially, story selection tends to slightly favor the left with stories such as this
[London Pride: Over a million to gather in the capital for 50th anniversary parade](https://www.joe.co.uk/news/london-pride-over-1-million-to-march-50th-anniversary-parade-345637) and report negatively on conservatives like this [Liz Truss is already more unpopular with the British public than Boris Johnson ever was](https://www.joe.co.uk/news/liz-truss-more-unpopular-than-boris-johnson-362311).
Regarding sourcing, they often use extensive quotes and credible sources such as the
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) and YouGov. In general, JOE.co.uk holds a left-leaning editorial bias and is factual when reporting political news. However, the lists they create are highly subjective and sensational, resulting in a Mostly Factual rating for overall reporting.
