Analysis / Bias
The Armed Forces Press is a conservative imposter website that is designed to look like a legitimate local newspaper. All of the websites use a similar design template.
The website publishes news related to the Military that routinely favors the right, such as this:
[Biden Doxxing Operators Was Not An Accident, It Is Treason](https://armedforces.press/biden-doxxing-operators-was-not-an-accident-it-is-treason/). This article uses the Questionable [Miami Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/miami-independent-bias/) as a reference.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, particularly former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as [A Race Between Escalating Nuclear War With Moscow And Trump Returning To Ensure Peace](https://armedforces.press/a-race-between-escalating-nuclear-war-with-moscow-and-trump-returning-to-ensure-peace/). While denigrating the left with conspiracy theories like this [America – Do You Really Think Biden’s War Is Not Coming Here? Part 1](https://armedforces.press/america-do-you-really-think-bidens-war-is-not-coming-here/).
The Armed Forces Press also promotes
[Covid-19 disinformation](https://armedforces.press/dod-whistleblower-goes-public-calls-for-investigation-into-new-covid-vaccine-injury-data/). In general, this is an imposter website that promotes extreme right-wing conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
