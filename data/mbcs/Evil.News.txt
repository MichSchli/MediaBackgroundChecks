History
Like most Questionable sources, Evil.News does not have an about page.
[Whois](http://whois.domaintools.com/trump.news) lists the domain as purchased in 2015, and all other information is redacted for privacy. News posts on this blog link to either JD Heyes, Mike Adams, or Ethan Huff; none of them have biographical information on the website. A Google search shows that [JD Heyers](https://twitter.com/JDHeyes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is the Sr. Correspondent with the Conspiracy/Pseudoscience website [News Target](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-target/). Mike Adams is the founder and owner of [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), which promotes right-wing conspiracies and quackery-level pseudoscience. To learn more about Mike Adams, check out this article: [Mike Adams Is Building an Alternate Reality Online](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/quackery/mike-adams-building-alternate-reality-online).

Analysis / Bias
In review, Evil.News does not state a mission or theme for this website, but it generally follows the Natural News genre of extreme-right propaganda and promotion of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
Evil.News frequently utilizes very strong loaded headlines that always favor the right such as this:
[Of course: Muslim officials working on behalf of United Nations block Christians from receiving aid.](https://www.evil.news/2019-12-29-muslim-un-officials-block-christians-aid.html) The primary source for this story is the Questionable [Clarion Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/clarion-project/), which has been labeled a hate group. Another example of the extreme right use of loaded emotional language is this: [Barack Obama committed treason against America by approving “Spygate” — is he now the focus of investigations](https://www.evil.news/2019-12-31-barack-obama-committed-treason-by-approving-spygate.html)? This story is again poorly sourced to the Conspiracy website [News Target.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-target/)
Evil.News also features a search bar, which leads to the
[Good Gopher](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/goodgopher/) search engine, which displays results exclusively from conspiracy, pseudoscience, and highly questionable sources. A search of [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) using Good Gopher directs to News Target with multiple denial articles, such as this: [“Climate change” hoax starting to crumble as scientists admit doom projections were totally wrong.](https://www.newstarget.com/2018-04-28-climate-change-hoax-starting-to-crumble-as-scientists-admit-doom-projections-were-totally-wrong.html)
