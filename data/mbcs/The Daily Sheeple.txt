History
Founded in 2010, The Daily Sheeple is a conspiracy-driven and sometimes anti-science website. The website lacks transparency as they do not have a clear about page or disclose ownership. All articles appear to be published by Sean Walton or through third party websites such as
[The Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), which allow republishing of their stories through Creative Commons Licenses. There is an [about section](https://www.thedailysheeple.com/about#terms) listed under the Terms and Conditions heading that reads “WE are the fourth estate – a new press for a new era. We don’t need to be licensed, and we will not be silenced.”
Funded by / Ownership
The Daily Sheeple does not specifically state ownership, however, on their
[Terms of Service](https://www.thedailysheeple.com/about#terms) page, they frequently mention the [Keryx Group, LLC](http://www.keryxgroup.com/) as the holder of this website. Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Sheeple is a strongly right-leaning conspiracy and pseudoscience website that frequently utilizes loaded emotional headlines such as this:
[Antifa terrorist with history of violence gets no time after attacking rabbi.](https://www.thedailysheeple.com/antifa-terrorist-with-history-of-violence-gets-no-time-after-attacking-rabbi/) This story 100% lacks sourcing and appears to be an opinion piece by Sean Walton. However, a plagiarism check reveals significant plagiarism from the Questionable source [Before it’s News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/before-its-news/), which has failed numerous fact checks. In general, all stories favor the far-right and denigrate the left such as this [‘The squad’ opposed to law barring sexual predators and terrorists from being hired at TSA](https://www.thedailysheeple.com/the-squad-opposed-to-law-barring-sexual-predators-and-terrorists-from-being-hired-at-tsa/). This story is sourced to the right-leaning [Washington Free Beacon](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-free-beacon/), which also has a poor track record with fact-checkers. When not promoting right-leaning content The Daily Sheeple also promotes conspiracy theories and [pseudoscience](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) such as [Chemtrails](https://www.thedailysheeple.com/is-this-the-real-purpose-of-chemtrails/), [Climate Change Denial](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), as well as promoting the Clinton’s as murderer’s such as this [New Conspiracy Theory: Does This Email Prove the Clinton Camp Knew Justice Scalia Would Be Murdered?](https://www.thedailysheeple.com/new-conspiracy-theory-does-this-email-prove-the-clinton-camp-knew-justice-scalia-would-be-murdered/). In general, this is a far-right website that frequently promotes conspiracy theories.
