History
According to their
[about page](http://mediatrackers.org/about/), “Media Trackers is dedicated to media accountability, government transparency, and quality fact-based journalism. Our site examines stories published in the mainstream media, explores claims made by some of the more partisan political groups, and provides the facts on the issues, people, and elections that matter.” The [contact page](http://mediatrackers.org/contact/) does not list a name or address, however, they indicate they are “a project of Greenhouse Solutions.” Unfortunately, we could not find any information about Greenhouse Solutions, nor is a link provided on the Media Trackers website. A [whois domain search](http://whois.domaintools.com/mediatrackers.org) reveals that the domain was purchased in 2010, but the information is redacted for privacy.
According to
[Sourcewatch](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Media_Trackers) “Media Trackers is an investigative non-profit launched in 2011 in Wisconsin, sponsored by [American Majority](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/American_Majority), to “dig up dirt on the left” rather than continuing to be “on the receiving end of damaging stories developed by liberal groups such as [Media Matters](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Media_Matters) and the [Center for American Progress](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Center_for_American_Progress).” Further, Media Trackers was founded by “Drew Ryun, son of former Kansas Republican Representative [Jim Ryun](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Jim_Ryun&action=edit&redlink=1), who served in the House of Representatives for 10 years, was a Deputy Director at the [Republican National Committee](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Republican_National_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1) and is now “the president of the 501(c)(4) arm,” [American Majority Action.”](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/American_Majority_Action)
Funded by / Ownership
Media Trackers do not openly disclose ownership but indicate they are a project of Greenhouse Solutions, which we simply cannot find any info on. It appears this website is actually a part of the right-leaning American Majority Action. Media Trackers is funded through a combination of advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Media Trackers publishes news that is routinely anti-left and pro-right. There is significant use of loaded language in headlines and articles such as this:
[6 Horribly Racist Comments from Obama Administration Officials, Top Democrats](http://mediatrackers.org/2013/06/20/6-horribly-racist-comments-from-obama-admin-officials/), and [Gwen Moore and Democracy for Sale.](http://mediatrackers.org/2018/12/13/gwen-moore-and-democracy-for-sale/) When it comes to sourcing most information is properly hyperlinked to credible sources, however, many sources fall on the right side of the spectrum. A general search of stories on the website indicates that almost all are Pro-Right in wording and story selection.
Media Trackers has faced criticism from left-leaning publications such as this from Mother Jones:
[Media Trackers, the Right’s New Oppo-Research Attack Dog.](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/05/media-trackers-opposition-research-wisconsin-dark-money/)
A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=mediatrackers&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking) reveals that Media Trackers has made a [Mostly False Claim](https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/01/media-trackers/conservative-group-media-trackers-says-wisconsin-r/).
