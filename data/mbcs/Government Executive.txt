Analysis / Bias
In review, Government Executive covers the federal government’s business and its huge departments and agencies. Original articles contain headlines that often use minimal loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Labor Department Set to Streamline Procurement Services.](https://www.govexec.com/management/2020/01/labor-department-set-start-procurement-shared-services/162645/) This article is also properly sourced to the Department of Labor and [Whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/). Some stories come from other Atlantic Media properties, such as this from The Atlantic: [Why Nikki Haley’s Departure Shocked Washington](https://www.govexec.com/management/2018/10/why-nikki-haleys-departure-shocked-washington/151887/).
Editorially, Government Executive is
[pro-union](https://www.govexec.com/management/2019/11/senate-democrats-push-union-protections-spending-package/161472/) and frequently reports somewhat negatively on the Trump administration, such as this originating from The Atlantic: [Why Trump (Probably) Won’t Ditch Rudy](https://www.govexec.com/management/2019/11/why-trump-probably-wont-ditch-rudy/161579/). In general, they report factually and hold a slight left-leaning editorial bias.
