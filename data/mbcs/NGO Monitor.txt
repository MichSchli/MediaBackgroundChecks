History
[Founded in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO_Monitor) by [Gerald M. Steinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_M._Steinberg), NGO Monitor is a Jerusalem-based NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) that analyzes and reports on the output of the international NGO community from a pro-Israel perspective. According to their [about page](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/about/), “NGO Monitor provides information and analysis, promotes accountability, and supports discussion on the reports and activities of NGOs (non-governmental organizations) claiming to advance human rights and humanitarian agendas.” [Read our profile on Israeli media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/israel-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
As an NGO, they do not receive government support and rely on donations for funding. According to their
[funding page](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/about/who-funds-ngo-monitor/), they state “NGO Monitor was founded jointly with the Wechsler Family Foundation. Private donors and foundations provide all our funding, and NGO Monitor receives no governmental support. NGO Monitor receives significant financial support from Research + Evaluation = Promoting Organizational Responsibility and Transparency (REPORT) (Formerly AFNGOM), which provided a grant of $1 million in 2016.”
Analysis / Bias
NGO Monitor has faced criticism and has been labeled a right-wing pro-Israeli group. For example, in 2013, a member of NGO Monitor was caught
[editing their own Wikipedia page](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-israeli-editing-wars-on-wikipedia-1.5281096), which is not allowed. Wikipedia then banned him as an editor. Further, the founder Gerald Steinburg [worked for the Israeli government](https://www.972mag.com/what-is-ngo-monitors-connection-to-the-israeli-government/) after the formation of the NGO, a seemingly obvious conflict of interest.
The NGO Monitor tracks other NGOs through monitoring their funding and support for human rights (Specifically Pro-Israel rights). They provide a
[database](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/) that lists the funding and description of NGOs around the world. The website also publishes pro-Israel reports that often criticize any organization that does not absolutely support Israel, such as this [See No Evil: NGOs Turn Terrorists into Civilians in 2021 Gaza Conflict](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos-terrorists-into-civilians-2021-gaza-conflict/). They also negatively identify any NGO or group that [supports the Palestinians](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/us-campaign-to-end-israeli-occupation/). Finally, the website features a blog that continues the narrative of framing any group that does not support Israel as an enemy of human rights. For example, they often attack [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/) for their support of ending Palestinian/Israeli apartheid: [HRW’s Inconsistency and Incoherence Continues: EJIL: Talk! Symposium on A Threshold Crossed](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/hrws-inconsistency-and-incoherence-continues-ejil-talk-symposium-on-a-threshold-crossed/).
In general, NGO Monitor works to delegitimize other NGOs based on their funding or non-support for Israel. While the information they publish is rooted in fact, it is so heavily one-sided that it amounts to right-wing pro-Israel propaganda.
