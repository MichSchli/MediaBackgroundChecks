Analysis / Bias
The Independent Florida Alligator publishes breaking news and ongoing developments such as
[“The latest news on UF’s barring of professors from testifying against the state.”](https://www.alligator.org/article/2021/11/developing-uf-barring-professors) Usually, the Alligator holds liberal positions regarding climate change, the environment, and other topics such as [“Gainesville tackles climate change and zero waste goal through green policy pursuit”](https://www.alligator.org/article/2021/09/solid-waste-ordinance) and [“Gainesville Mayor encourages community to celebrate Juneteenth.”](https://www.alligator.org/article/2020/06/gainesville-mayor-encourages-community-to-celebrate-juneteenth) The Alligator uses hyperlinks and credible sources such as trustees.ufl.edu, gainesville.legistar.com, the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and local Florida newspapers when it comes to sourcing.
The Independent Florida Alligator endorsed President Joe Biden in the 2020 election in an editorial titled
[“Election recommendations from The Alligator Editorial Board.”](https://www.alligator.org/article/2020/10/election-recommendations-from-the-alligator-editorial-board) A quote from the article reads, “We have the choice between a typical politician or a misogynistic racist facing more than 25 sexual assault accusations who can’t stop attacking the military, initially refused to condemn white supremacy and decimated the credibility of the office he holds with his countless lies.” They generally report news factually and with a strong left-leaning editorial bias.
