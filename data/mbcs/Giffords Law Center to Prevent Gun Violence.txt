History
Launched in 2013, Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence (Giffords.org) is a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on promoting gun control. It was previously known as Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS).
Their
[about page](https://giffords.org/about/) describes their mission as “fighting to end the gun lobby’s stranglehold on our political system.” Giffords served as a Democratic member of the U.S. House, representing Arizona’s 8th Congressional District. Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, are the founders. In 2011, Giffords was shot while meeting her constituents in Tucson, Arizona. Giffords survived the attack and has become an advocate for safer gun laws.

In review, articles published by Giffords.org under the blog feature topics such as the voices of gun violence survivors and youth activists. Headlines are emotionally charged, such as
[“Ghost Guns Are a Major Problem. Responsible Gun Owners Are Demanding Solutions.”](https://giffords.org/blog/2022/08/ghost-guns-are-a-major-problem-responsible-gun-owners-are-demanding-solutions/)
Articles are typically sourced through credible outlets such as The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF); however, some claims are not referenced through hyperlinking. For example, a quote from the article reads, “With nearly 50,000 Americans dying from gun violence in 2021,” there is no link to a source to back up the claim. Further, while it is true nearly 50K Americans died as a result of guns,
[only 43%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/) of that number were murdered by a gun, with the remaining being suicide. This is misleading as “gun violence” implies shooting another person, not oneself.
The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence is a mostly fact-based, left-leaning gun regulation advocacy group.
