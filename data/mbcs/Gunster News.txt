Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the content, Gunster News republishes news articles, often word for word, from other sources, indicating plagiarism. For example, the article titled
[Being A Death Investigator During COVID Was A Nightmare](https://gunsternews.com/being-a-death-investigator-during-covid-was-a-nightmare/#) is copied [verbatim](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/death-investigator-covid-pandemic-nightmare_n_64986492e4b08f753c2cb43a#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20changed%20the%20work,when%20working%20in%20the%20field.) from the [HuffPost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/). Further, headlines are copied directly from the source and often contain emotionally loaded language, such as [“Mike Pence distances himself from trading insults with his old friend Trump](https://gunsternews.com/mike-pence-distances-himself-from-trading-insults-with-his-old-friend-trump/),” An excerpt from the article states, “Former Vice President Mike Pence refrained from ‘trading insults’ with his former boss during a New Hampshire event after an Independent voter questioned his stance.” The article relies on direct quotes without providing external hyperlinks for sourcing. This story is also plagiarized verbatim from the Huffpost.
In another article titled
[“The Ron DeSantis Campaign Is An Even Bigger Failure Than You Thought](https://gunsternews.com/the-ron-desantis-campaign-is-an-even-bigger-failure-than-you-thought/),” the author uses strong negative language to describe [Ron DeSantis](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ron-desantis-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and his campaign. The article describes his campaign as a “complete failure” and him as “robotic, cold, and distant.” This language indicates a left-leaning bias. The original story is copied from the left-leaning [PoliticusUSA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politicususa/). They also republish stories from sources that have been rated as questionable, such as the right-leaning [Gateway Pundit,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) as seen in the article titled “ [Illegal Immigrants in Chicago Demand Free Housing and Paid Job Training (VIDEO) | The Gateway Pundit.”](https://gunsternews.com/illegal-immigrants-in-chicago-demand-free-housing-and-paid-job-training-video-the-gateway-pundit/)
In general, Gunster News entirely lacks credibility as they are not transparent in ownership, they do not provide hyperlinks to the sources they have plagiarized from, and they sometimes rely on sources that fail fact checks. When it comes to bias, they republish from a variety of sources, both right and left.
Failed Fact Checks
- They do not publish original content, but some of the sources they rely on have poor records with fact-checkers.
In conclusion, we rate Gunster News as Least Biased based on story selection that uses a wide range of sources. We also rate them as Questionable due to a lack of transparency, the use of poor sources, and routine plagiarizing of other sources’ content without proper credit. (M. Huitsing 07/24/2023)
