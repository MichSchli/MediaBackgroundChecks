Analysis / Bias
The Ohio Independent website is designed to look like a local media outlet. The website uses the same template as the other five American Independent Media Network imposter sites. The network also republishes articles from The American Independent’s website, with a disclosure at the bottom of articles that reads “Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation,” the nonprofit arm of The American Independent.
In review, the Ohio Independent publishes original news stories with loaded language:
[Ohio GOP Rep. Steve Chabot’s vote against contraception bill slammed in new ads](https://ohioindependent.com/2022/10/14/ohio-gop-rep-steve-chabots-vote-against-contraception-bill-slammed-in-new-ads/). Articles are adequately sourced from outlets such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/), and [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/). The website also republishes news content from the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)
Editorially, all stories and opinions favor the left and usually denigrate the right. Furthermore, the Ohio Independent has a link for community news, leading to a recipe for Coffee Cakes. While some stories mention Ohio, most are hyper-partisan political pieces promoting the Democratic Party. In general, this is a left-biased imposter website that promotes Democratic Party propaganda and lacks transparency.
