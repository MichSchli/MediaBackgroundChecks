History
[Founded in 2019](https://whois.domaintools.com/homevaccineeducationnetwork.com), the Home Vaccine Education Network is an anti-vaccine website that promotes misinformation regarding vaccines. According to their [about page](https://homevaccineeducationnetwork.com/about), “We are a group of parents, all former vaccinators, who also happen to be activists, journalists, and Ph.D. scientists. We were caught blindsided in our own lives, unware of the stark disconnect between the popular propaganda about vaccines and the actual dire lack of safety information.”
The website also features a
[disclaimer](https://homevaccineeducationnetwork.com/disclaimer) that reads, “The site’s authors are not medical doctors. The text, images, and products offered here are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as official medical advice, nor can they substitute for consultation with a qualified medical professional. We wish to be very clear that it is critical that you are responsible for your own medical decisions. The authors for this site are not responsible for how anything written here is used or misused by others.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership, editors, or authors.

Analysis / Bias
The primary mission of the Home Vaccine Education Network is to create vaccine hesitancy through the spread of disinformation. The website was launched prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore they are not exclusive to Covid-19-vaccination misinformation. They are also opposed to
[measles vaccines](https://homevaccineeducationnetwork.com/introductory-video) which have been proven effective and safe for a long time. Further, they promote the debunked vaccines-autism link such as this [Does a woman’s vaccine history cause her child to develop autism?](https://homevaccineeducationnetwork.com/autism_in_babies) There is no scientific evidence that vaccines lead to [autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/).
During the Covid-19 pandemic, they routinely published misinformation and outright falsehoods such as this
[Shedding in the Schools](https://homevaccineeducationnetwork.com/schoolkids-shedding-study). There is [no proof](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-covid-vaccine-spike-proteins-are-not-being-shed-from-vaccinated.html) that children can shed spike proteins from the Covid vaccine, and mRNA can only enter the body through a dose given by injection; it can’t be passed between people. The shots are not infectious. In general, they are quackery-level pseudoscience website that promotes anti-vaccination propaganda.
