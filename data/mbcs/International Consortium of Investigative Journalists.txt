Analysis / Bias
In review, the ICIJ website provides investigations, data, and a “global network of
[267 investigative journalists](https://www.icij.org/journalists/) in 100 countries who collaborate on in-depth investigative stories.” The primary purpose of this website is to expose and report credibly on stories from strict countries with accuracy. Many times countries limit free journalism, and ICIJ covers what may be suppressed, such as this [Investigating Malaysia’s history, to understand the present](https://www.icij.org/inside-icij/2020/08/investigating-malaysias-history-to-understand-the-present/). The ICIJ also reports negatively on former President Donald Trump’s business ties but is always evidence-based such as this [Offshore Trove Exposes Trump-Russia links and Piggy Banks of the Wealthiest 1 Percent](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/). In general, this is a low-biased source that is factual.
