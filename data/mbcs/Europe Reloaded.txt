History
[Founded in 2016](https://www.europereloaded.com/) by Roger Landry, Europe Reloaded is a far-right conspiracy and pseudoscience website. According to their [about page](https://www.europereloaded.com/about/), “We do not endorse liberty- and economy-destroying measures such as lockdowns, the wearing of masks, and the fear propaganda of the media based on lies about ‘cases’ and death rates. We oppose the Great Reset policy of the Davos crowd and the massive election fraud that has been proven to exist in the November US presidential election. We oppose forced vaccine policies and vaccine passports.” [Read our profile on USA media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Europe Reloaded routinely publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience information. When it comes to pseudoscience, they
[promote](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) [anti-GMO propaganda](https://www.europereloaded.com/rushed-covid-gmo-vaccines-legal-action-to-cancel-eu-regulation-2020-1043/) and [anti-Vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) fear-mongering. They also report on the Government’s use of [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) as a means of [GeoEngineering](https://www.europereloaded.com/video-chemtrails-can-biowarfare-geoengineering-history-biological-chemical-experiments-citizens/). Regarding conspiracies, they report on the dangers of the so-called New World Order, the [Clinton’s as murderers](http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/clinton-foundation-cfo-i-know-where-all-the-bodies-are-buried/), and numerous claims of [false flags](https://www.europereloaded.com/witness-exposes-ukrainian-army-false-flag-operation-in-donbass/), including [9-11](https://www.europereloaded.com/new-york-fire-commissioners-call-for-new-9-11-investigation-about-pre-planted-explosives/).
When it comes to sourcing, virtually all of them are either Questionable, fellow conspiracy sites, or far-right biased. We found some sample sources:
[Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), and [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/). Finally, throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, they have promoted false and misleading claims such as [41,834 DEAD 3.9 Million Injured Following COVID Vaccines in European Database](https://www.europereloaded.com/41834-dead-3-9-million-injured-following-covid-vaccines-in-european-database/).
This information comes from the European Database of Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions.
[According](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-scotland-statistics-idUSL1N2QQ24L) to the European Medical Agency, which publishes the database, “For most medicines and vaccines, the vast majority of suspected side effects are not eventually confirmed as side effects. It is difficult to state with certainty the real cause of death for cases with fatal outcomes even if all data, including autopsy results, are available.”
Failed Fact Checks
- A certified fact-checker has not fact-checked them; however, their
[parent site](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-liberty-beacon/)frequently republishes misinformation on Europe Reloaded.
