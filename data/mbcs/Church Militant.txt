Analysis / Bias
In review, the Church Militant is a radical Catholic news and opinion website with an extreme right-wing bias in reporting. Church Militant supports issues affiliated with the far right, such as
[anti-LGBT](https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/jefferson-citys-cathedral-school-resists-lgbt-policy) and [anti-abortion](https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/abortion-is-racism) positions. Within the anti-abortion article, they utilize untrustworthy sources such as [Life News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-news/) and [Black Genocide](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/black-genocide/), which appear on our questionable list due to numerous failed fact checks and the promotion of conspiracies.
Articles often contain very
[strong loaded emotional language](https://www.churchmilitant.com/video/episode/vortex-a-rigged-election) that denigrates the left, such as this quote: “Killary and her allies even rigged their own primary process to ensure that she won, ensuring Bernie Sanders never had a fighting chance. Who on earth would be stupid enough to discount that they wouldn’t try the exact same thing in the general election?” The derogatory term “Killary” used for Hillary Clinton is based on the far-right conspiracy theory that the Clintons murder people for political gain.
In 2018, the Church Militant was officially declared a
[hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/08/17/ultra-orthodox-catholic-propaganda-outlet-pushes-anti-lgbt-agenda) by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) and the reputable [Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0227/Trump-and-the-rise-of-the-extreme-right). In response to the Christian Science Monitor, the [Church Militant proclaims](https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/fake-news-labels-church-militant-hate-group) them as a fake news source. We rate the [Christian Science Monitor](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/christian-science-monitor/) as highly factual by our methodology.
In this 2024 update, we observe they continue to promote anti-LGBTQ propaganda such as this
[HOMOSEXUAL PLAGUE](https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/homosexual-plague). They also attempt to refute Catholic organizations whom they view as leftist, such as [this](https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/vaccine-mandate-lunacy): “Just this week, the archdiocese of Chicago, under the direction of leftist Cardinal Blase Cupich (in lockstep with other far-left leaders), put out a tyrannical vaccination policy mandating each and every employee of the Archdiocese of Chicago, both lay and cleric, take the COVID-19 gene therapy jab.” Multiple fact-checkers have debunked the [gene therapy pseudoscience](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-dont-alter-dna-arent-subjected-to-federal-regulation-bioweapons-david-martin/). Here is one from [Health Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-feedback/).
The Church Militant is a far-right organization that promotes right-wing propaganda, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience and has been accused of promoting hate.
