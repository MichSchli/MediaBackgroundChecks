Analysis / Bias
In review, Evonomics publishes news and opinions that align with the political left of the USA. Articles and headlines sometimes utilize loaded emotional wording such as this
[Do Billionaires Destroy Democracy and Capitalism?](https://evonomics.com/why-billionaires-destroy-democracy-and-capitalism/) This story is properly sourced to [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) and the left-leaning [New Yorker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-yorker/).
Editorially, almost all stories favor the left, such as this
[How Bernie Sanders Was the Only Candidate to Uphold an Essential Pro-Market Principle](https://evonomics.com/how-bernie-sanders-was-the-only-candidate-to-uphold-an-essential-promarket/). Generally, the news is reported factually but with a left-leaning bias regarding editorials.
