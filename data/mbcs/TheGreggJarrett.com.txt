Analysis / Bias
In review, the website publishes news and commentary by Gregg Jarrett and unnamed staff. News reported by staff utilizes moderately loaded headlines that favor the right such as this:
[Pelosi Can’t Be Bothered to Read Trump’s Letter Before Impeachment Vote](https://thegreggjarrett.com/pelosi-cant-be-bothered-to-read-trumps-letter-before-impeachment-vote/), and this [Trump Rips Pelosi’s ‘Stupid’ Impeachment Effort at Pennsylvania Rally](https://thegreggjarrett.com/trump-rips-pelosis-stupid-impeachment-effort-at-pennsylvania-rally/). This latter story links to Hannity.com as a source of information. Sean Hannity has a poor fact-check record, with [50% of his claims being Mostly False to Pants on Fire](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/sean-hannity/), according to [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/).
Editorially, the website features an opinion section that Gregg Jarrett exclusively writes. The commentaries hold an extreme pro-Trump bias, often referring to the Trump investigations as a Witch Hunt:
[Latest Pelosi-Schiff impeachment ‘witch hunt’ is venomous affront to constitutional principles](https://thegreggjarrett.com/latest-pelosi-schiff-impeachment-witch-hunt-is-venomous-affront-to-constitutional-principles/) [Ukraine probe has morphed into the ‘Nancy Pelosi-Adam Schiff Witch Hunt’](https://thegreggjarrett.com/ukraine-probe-has-morphed-into-the-nancy-pelosi-adam-schiff-witch-hunt/) [The New Pelosi-Schiff “Witch Hunt” to Impeach Trump is an Abuse Of Power](https://thegreggjarrett.com/the-new-pelosi-schiff-witch-hunt-to-impeach-trump-is-an-abuse-of-power/)
Finally, the website has promoted election fraud conspiracies such as, ‘
[WHY ARE THEY HIDING?’: Dominion Cancels Hearing Appearance In PA](https://thegreggjarrett.com/why-are-they-hiding-dominion-cancels-hearing-appearance-in-pa/). There is no evidence of fraud by Dominion; in fact, they are [suing](https://www.dominionvoting.com/setting-the-record-straight/) many news outlets and personalities for defamation based on false claims.
In general, all editorials favor the right, specifically Donald Trump, while consistently denigrating the left with loaded emotional wording.
