Analysis / Bias
In review, Chronicles differs from other Conservative publications in that they are anti-interventionist militarily. They uphold a more Paleoconservative-Libertarian position in their writings. One of the most famous writers for this publication is well-known nationalist
[Patrick Buchanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Buchanan). Chronicles use minimally loaded language in their articles, such as this: [Commeration of Amiens](https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/commeration-of-amiens/). While this article is well written, it does not contain a hyperlink source but relies on block quotes. In fact, it isnâ€™t easy to find any sourcing on this website. Virtually all stories [favor the right](https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/trump-and-the-invasion-of-the-west/).
In 2024, they promote vaccine hesitancy using unreliable sources Michelle Malkin such as this
[What Really Happened to Justin Bieber?](https://chroniclesmagazine.org/web/what-really-happened-to-justin-bieber/) They also have promoted election fraud conspiracies, as evidenced in this article [https://chroniclesmagazine.org/web/election-oddities/](https://chroniclesmagazine.org/web/election-oddities/)
Finally, Chronicles has been
[criticized](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/neo-confederates) by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) for promoting the Neo-Confederate Movement. In general, they are right-biased and sometimes promote misinformation.
