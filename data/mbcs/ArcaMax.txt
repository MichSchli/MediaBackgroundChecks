Analysis / Bias

[Roll Call](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/roll-call/). A typical headline reads like this: [Homeland Security announces easing of facial recognition rule](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-2303464?fs). ArcaMax does not publish original content but rather republishes from other sources. In general, these are credible sources such as the [Los Angeles Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/), [Kansas City Star](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kansas-city-star/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). They utilize numerous sources, with most originating from the Tribune Content Agency.
Editorially, ArcaMax provides opinion columns from a wide range of
[known writers](https://www.arcamax.com/columns) and breaks them down on the website, From the Left, Moderate, and From the Right. Some notable columnists they republish are, from the left, Robert Reich, Moderate Steve Chapman, and from the right, they feature numerous columnists such as [Ben Shapiro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ben-shapiro-bias-rating/), [Dennis Prager](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/), Erick Erickson, Michelle Malkin, [Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/), and Pat Buchanan. Many of these right-leaning columnists have failed fact checks in the past. The website also features columnists who report on health, such as [Dr. Oz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/doctoroz-com/), who is a purveyor of pseudoscience and medical quackery. In general, ArcaMax reports news factually; however, editorial columnists weigh heavily to the right and may not always be factual.

[100 syndicated comics](https://www.arcamax.com/comics) such as Peanuts, Beetle Bailey and Dilbert.
