Analysis / Bias
In review, Thinking Humanity does not publish original material but summarizes content from other sources. For example, this story,
[Having Only One Guinea Pig In Switzerland Is Illegal Because They Get Lonely](https://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2019/08/having-only-one-guinea-pig-in-switzerland-is-illegal-because-they-get-lonely.html), is [copied verbatim](https://educateinspirechange.org/nature/its-illegal-to-own-only-one-guinea-pig-in-switzerland-because-they-get-lonely/#targetText=It's%20Illegal%20to%20Own%20Only,Switzerland%20Because%20They%20Get%20Lonely&targetText=Guinea%20pigs%2C%20being%20herd%20animals,boots%20their%20quality%20of%20life.) from [EducateInspireChange](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/educate-inspire-change/). Politically, they align with the left through frequent criticism of conservatives and former President Donald Trump, such as this: [Psychologists Say Donald Trump Shows Signs of Mental Illness, ‘Malignant Narcissism](https://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2017/03/psychologists-say-donald-trump-shows-signs-of-mental-illness-malignant-narcissism.html). This story is properly sourced to the [Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/).
Thinking Humanity also publishes scientific news, which for the most part is accurate; however, they also have promoted pseudoscience such as miracle cures

There isn’t any [scientifically proven danger](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815618/) to the use of fluoride. These articles have been removed without explanation. In general, this is a source that moderately promotes pseudoscience and, in the past, occasionally plagiarized the work of others.
