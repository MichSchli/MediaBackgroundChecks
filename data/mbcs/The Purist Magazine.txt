Analysis / Bias
The Purist divides content into categories such as fitness, beauty, food, style, food, and wellness, to name a few. The majority of articles focus on health and wellness. Articles and headlines do not use loaded wording such as this
[Do You Have a Food Allergy or Just an Intolerance—How To Tell](https://thepuristonline.com/2020/09/food-allergy-or-just-an-intolerance-how-to-tell/). The website also frequently covers celebrities such as this [Welcome To Selma’s World](https://thepuristonline.com/2021/10/welcome-to-selmas-world/), discussing Selma Blair’s battle with multiple sclerosis.
The Purist also publishes (Pseudo) science-based information that is not always factual. For example, they promote unproven and dangerous health claims such as
[detox programs](https://thepuristonline.com/2021/05/eastern-healing/), which are proven impossible [through diet.](https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/the-facts-behind-4-detox-myths-should-you-detox-your-body.h00-159385890.html) Further, they have promoted [biomagnetism](https://thepuristonline.com/2017/12/biomagnetism/) as a cure-all, including cancer. [Research studies](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/magnets) do not support the use of magnets for health benefits. Finally, during Covid-19, Christa Cuomo [promoted her own cures and remedies](https://thepuristonline.com/2020/04/cristina-cuomo-corona-protocol-week-3/) that are not supported by science, such as “broth of cayenne pepper, ginger, and garlic or the lemon and ginger tea or vitamin C.” She also promoted bleach baths, which obviously would have zero effect on a virus inside the body. In general, The Purist promotes quackery level pseudoscience that may be dangerous if a person chooses not to seek qualified medical attention.
