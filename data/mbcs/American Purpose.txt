[Founded in 2020](https://static.politico.com/2d/d7/7b4f07444e6fa573c2900093028a/american-purpose-press-release.pdf) by Dr. Francis Fukuyama, American Purpose is an online magazine covering news, politics, and culture.

According to their [about page](https://www.americanpurpose.com/about/), “First, we aim to defend and promote liberal democracy in the United States. Second, we seek to better understand and address the challenges to liberal democracy abroad. Finally, we intend to offer criticism and commentary on history and biography, high art and pop culture, science, and technology.” [Jeffrey Gedmin](https://www.americanpurpose.com/author/jeffrey-gedmin/) serves as CEO and editor-in-chief.

Analysis / Bias
American Purpose publishes news and commentary covering liberal democracy and culture. The website site also lists their events and podcasts on a wide range of topics. Finally, they offer an opinion column by Dr. Fukuyama. News posts cover political philosophy, and frequently a concern for expanding authoritarianism such as this
[Democracy Dies in Disinformation](https://www.americanpurpose.com/articles/democracy-dies-in-disinformation/). This article, like most, is long-form journalism and very well sourced from credible media and information outlets.
Politically, American Purpose strongly rejects former President Trump
[Can American Democracy Recover after Trump?](https://www.americanpurpose.com/articles/can-american-democracy-recover-after-trump/) A quote from the article reads, “Yet Trump seems determined to end his presidency as he waged it: a bitter, vengeful, polarizing demagogue, whose first and last calculations are about himself.” While they are critical of President Biden, they report more favorably, such as this [Sometimes You Get Another Chance](https://www.americanpurpose.com/articles/sometimes-you-get-another-chance/). In the article, they state, “Biden’s election provides new hope. Because of Trump’s disdain for supporting democracy abroad, the rise of autocratic China and Russia, and [a 14-year global democratic recession](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy), conditions are ripe for a bold American initiative to support democratic ideals around the world.”
Finally, the blog by Dr. Fukuyama also focuses on anti-authoritarianism. It is critical of the current Republican party where he
[states](https://www.americanpurpose.com/blog/fukuyama/fake-news-and-conspiracy-theories/), “Over the previous decade, the party had been moving steadily from Reagan-era concerns with taxes and regulation to one based on identity. To be a Trump Republican meant thinking of oneself as non-elite despised by liberals, someone defined by race, by conservative values, or by place of residence.” In general, American Purpose provides well-written long-form journalism that is factual and moderately aligns with the left.
