Analysis / Bias
In review, story selection always favors the left and frequently denigrates the right. Headlines and articles contain loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Latest Mueller Revelation Could Mean More Serious Trouble for Trump: Mueller Uncovered a Kidnapping Plot with Michael Flynn Right in the Middle](http://tplnews.com/latest-mueller-revelation-could-mean-more-serious-trouble-for-trump-mueller-uncovered-a-kidnapping-plot-with-michael-flynn-right-in-the-middle/). This story completely lacks sourcing and is dated 10/11/19, despite the original story [appearing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/10/michael-flynn-trump-turkish-dissident-cleric-plot) on November 10, 2017. The unnamed author also offers opinions with very strong emotional wording “As if President Donald Trump wasn’t appalling enough on his own, every few days new information about members of his administration, his peers, or his family, is brought to light which makes them look just as appalling.”
Regarding sourcing information,
[some articles](http://tplnews.com/long-time-trump-advisor-under-scrutiny-for-changing-trump-speeches-to-make-them-more-middle-east-friendly/) contain proper sourcing to credible media outlets, while others are not sourced at all, despite coming from other authoritative sources. In general, this is not a credible website for news.
