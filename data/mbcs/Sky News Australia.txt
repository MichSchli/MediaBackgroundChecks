Analysis / Bias
In 2021,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Australia 25/180 in their [ Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/australia), stating, [“Investigative journalism in danger](https://rsf.org/en/australia).” Center-Right Conservative [Scott Morrison](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-45292331) is the Prime Minister of Australia. [The Liberal-National Coalition](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48331125), known as The Coalition, is an alliance of center-right political parties, with Morrison serving as the leader.
In review, Sky News Australia publishes news with story selection that favors the center-right Morrison Government such as this:
[“Morrison ‘unbelievably good’ at handling coronavirus crisis.”](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6143029207001) They also cover critical opposition voices: [“Morrison government is ‘only good at manufacturing slogans](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6196202859001).’ Further, they [promote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeykREAlYSg) conspiracy theories regarding coronavirus and climate change and do not report favorably on [immigration.](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6154311499001) When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration favorably [“President Trump has ‘huge win’ following powerful endorsement](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6182101064001).”
Finally, a
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 52% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 17% do not, ranking them #12 in trust of the major Australian news providers. In general, story selection and editorial positions mostly favor the right and are not always factual.
