History
[Founded in 1993](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are) by Billionaire investor George Soros, Open Society Foundations (formerly Open Society Institute) is an international grant-making network. According to their [about page](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are), they give “thousands of grants every year towards building inclusive and vibrant democracies.” They further state that they are the “world’s largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights.” Finally, [they report](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are/financials), “For over three decades, the Open Society Foundations have had expenditures of more than $16 billion dollars.”
Open Society Foundations is based in
[New York City](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are/offices-foundations), with offices worldwide. According to [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/), in 2020, George Soros’s wealth is estimated to be around 8.3 billion dollars.

George Soros was mentored by philosopher Karl Popper who coined the term
[“Open Society](https://www.libertarianism.org/topics/popper-karl-1902-1994),” meaning the opposite of authoritarian dictatorship and in support of democracy. Popper’s influence led to Soros eventually creating his foundations to fight for an open democratic society’s principles.
Due to the amount of money and the vast amount of organizations and causes George Soros supports, he has become a target of conservatives and conspiracy theorists who frequently
[promote conspiracy theories](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-49584157) against him. For example, one conspiracy goes that [George Soros was a Nazi](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-photo-soros-nazi-bookkeeper/fact-check-photographshows-nazi-bookkeeper-notgeorge-soros-idUSKBN23P2TP), even though he is Jewish, hid from the Nazis, and was a child at the time. Conservatives view anything funded by Soros Negatively. For example, he was accused of alleged [election fraud](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-soros-not-arrested/fact-check-george-soros-has-not-been-arrested-for-election-interference-idUSKBN2872B6) during the 2020 Presidential Election, and anytime there is a protest by the left, he is charged with either funding it or orchestrating it.

Open Society Foundations supports organizations and causes that align with the progressive left. The above causes clearly state how much they spent on each, but not specifically which organization received funds.
The Open Society Foundations website publishes press releases such as this
[Open Society Foundations Announce 2020 Puerto Rico Youth Fellows](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/newsroom). Under the “Voices” section, they publish news and commentary that aligns with the left. There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this [Carnage and Triumph: American Democracy on the Spot](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/carnage-and-triumph-american-democracy-on-the-spot) and this [Tax Injustice Goes Well Beyond Trump](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/tax-injustice-goes-well-beyond-trump). This first story is not sourced, while the second is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as [ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and [Public Integrity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-public-integrity/).
In summary, Open Society Foundations
[donates to numerous left-leaning media outlets and political organizations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/?s=open+society+foundation), with many rated as High factual sources such as ProPublica and the [Brennan Center for Justice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brennan-center-for-justice/); however, some are listed as Questionable, such as [MoveOn.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/move-on/), which has failed numerous fact checks. In general, they hold a progressive left bias, and while the news they report is factual, some of the sources they fund are questionable.
