Analysis / Bias
In review, Politizoom reports news with a left-leaning bias in both story selections that favors the left and through the use of emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[Not Only Is Jack Smith Humiliating Trump’s Lawyers, Now He’s Stealing Trump’s Excuses](https://politizoom.com/not-only-is-jack-smith-humiliating-trumps-lawyers-now-hes-stealing-trumps-excuses/). This story does not provide hyperlinked sourcing. In another [article](https://politizoom.com/how-stupid-can-stupid-get-dont-touch-that-dial/) labeled as an opinion piece, there is again no sourced information at all despite there being specific information mentioned, such as a media interview that occurred on that day.
Other stories reviewed provide hyperlinked sourcing such as this:
[Mary Trump says “This Time Feels Different” She’s Right It Is](https://politizoom.com/mary-trump-says-this-time-feels-different-shes-right-it-is/), where they link to the primary source Mary Trump. In another article, [There’s A RICO Charge In Trump’s Future, and the Rest Of Them Are Wild](https://politizoom.com/theres-a-rico-charge-in-trumps-future-and-the-rest-of-them-are-wild/), the information in the story is appropriately linked to [Reuters](https://politizoom.com/theres-a-rico-charge-in-trumps-future-and-the-rest-of-them-are-wild/). Therefore, Politizoom has a mixed record in providing sources of information.
Editorially, all stories favor the left and consistently denigrate conservatives and former
[President Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), such as this [Watch Johnathan Turley Embarrass Himself Shilling for Trump](https://politizoom.com/watch-johnathan-turley-embarrass-himself-shilling-for-trump/) and [‘Sidney’s F**ked’ Had ‘Possible Mental Health Break’ Now Indictment’s Afoot](https://politizoom.com/sidneys-fked-had-possible-mental-health-break-now-indictments-afoot/). Finally, when reporting on the [Biden administration](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-biden-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/), they present a positive tone like this [It’s The Economy Stupid! Bidenomics Strikes Back](https://politizoom.com/its-the-economy-stupid-bidenomics-strikes-back/).
In general, this is a one-sided left-biased website that does not source properly and lacks transparency.
