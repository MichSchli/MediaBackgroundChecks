Analysis / Bias
The Daily Mail is a known supporter of the
[Conservatives](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/03/07/how-left-or-right-wing-are-uks-newspapers). They are also one of the pro-Brexit tabloids. According to a [Reuters ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) [article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-judges/branded-enemies-of-the-people-over-brexit-case-senior-uk-judges-hit-back-idUSKBN1701BA), the Daily Mail published a controversial headline in response to a Brexit Court ruling criticizing the judges by branding them as ‘enemies of the people.’ According to [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), the Daily Mail has also been criticized by [Wikipedia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikipedia/) founder Jimmy Wales for publishing fake news articles and “hyped up” headlines and “ [mastered the art of running stories that aren’t true](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/19/daily-mail-jimmy-wales-fake-news-wikipedia-wikitribune.html).” Further, CNBC reported that DMG media responded by saying, “DailyMail.com is the very antithesis of click-bait and hype headlines. We just tell stories better than anyone else.”
The Daily Mail tends to publish stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded wordings such as
[“Woman, 63, ‘becomes PREGNANT in the mouth’ with baby squid after eating calamari”](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2159692/Womans-mouth-falls-pregnant-squid-biting-sea-creature-scientists-claim.html), which is a misleading headline. In 2017, Wikipedia banned the Daily Mail as an ‘ [unreliable’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/08/wikipedia-bans-daily-mail-as-unreliable-source-for-website) source. When it comes to sourcing information, they use minimal hyperlinked sourcing and sourcing to themselves. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) Institute survey found that 26% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 47% do not, ranking them #11 in trust of the major UK news providers. In general, most stories favor the right; however, the Daily Mail will report either side of the story is sensational enough.
