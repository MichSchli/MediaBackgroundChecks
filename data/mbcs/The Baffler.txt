Analysis / Bias
The Baffler covers a wide range of topics through solid journalism that is hard-hitting and, at times, humorous. They also cover politics from a progressive/socialist perspective, such as this
[Nationalism Kills](https://thebaffler.com/alienated/nationalism-kills-zakaria) and [The Long Brutality](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-long-brutality-blain), which focuses on social justice and equality for African-Americans.
Editorially, almost all stories favor the left through pointing out income inequality,
[Irreconcilable Billionaires](https://thebaffler.com/alienated/irreconcilable-billionaires-zakaria), and concern for climate change [Climate Will Change Faster Than We Will](https://thebaffler.com/latest/climate-will-change-faster-than-we-will). While The Baffler occasionally promotes Socialist ideas such as strong support for labor, LGBTQ rights, and a negative perception of capitalism, that is not their primary focus. In general, The Baffler aligns strongly with the progressive left and is factual in reporting.
