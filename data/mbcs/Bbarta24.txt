Analysis / Bias
In review, Bbarta24 reports local/national news with low bias such as this
[Govt wants to control traffic in Dhaka digitally: PM](http://en.bbarta24.net/national/2019/02/28/21946). This story is not sourced with hyperlinks. It appears they have not published new content since 2019 and may no longer be in business.
Editorially, there is little criticism of the government, which results in the promotion of propaganda through omission.
