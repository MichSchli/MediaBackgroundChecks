History
[Founded in 2012](http://whois.domaintools.com/fakehatecrimes.org), Fake Hate Crimes is a website that lists fake hate crimes with hyperlinks to news articles in database format. It builds on the work of [Laird Wilcox](http://www.fakehatecrimes.org/lairdwilcox), whose [Crying Wolf](http://www.fakehatecrimes.org/Crying-Wolf-by-Laird-Wilcox.pdf) (PDF) is the original book on this subject. The site does not have a proper about page but states its purpose is “to compile a comprehensive database of the false reports of “hate crimes” committed (mostly) in the USA.” [Laird Wilcox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Wilcox) is an American researcher specializing in studying political fringe movements. In his self-published book Watchdogs, Wilcox asserts that groups like the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), the [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/), Political Research Associates, and the Center for Democratic Renewal collect millions of dollars by greatly exaggerating the size and danger of such groups, becoming “a massive extortion racket.” [Read our country media profile of the USA.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Fake Hate Crimes does not state ownership on the website, and there does not appear to be a revenue model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website lists, in a table format, supposed fake hate crimes committed mostly in the USA. Column one displays the Fake News Report’s summary, column two provides an external link to the source of the story, usually a mainstream media source. The third column is a repeat of the first with a short summary. In reviewing the links provided, most do source to credible high factual media outlets; however, there are some that do not. For example, this story comes from the extreme right-wing conspiracy website
[Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/): [‘WHITE SUPREMACIST’ SHOOTING OF 7-YEAR-OLD BLACK GIRL; GUNMAN TURNS OUT TO BE BLACK](https://www.infowars.com/white-supremacist-shooting-of-7-year-old-black-girl-gunman-turns-out-to-be-black/). This story is true, but Infowars is typically not factual. Fake Hate Crimes also source the factually mixed and right-biased [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/) and [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and the [Daily Mail,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) all of which have poor track records with fact-checkers. Generally, the stories on Fake Hate Crimes tend to be true and stick to their mission of reporting only on fake hate crimes.
