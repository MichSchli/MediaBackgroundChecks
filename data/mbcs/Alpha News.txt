Analysis / Bias
In review, Alpha News reports news with poor sourcing, such as using a Facebook page as a primary source:
[Gun-Control Group Issues Apology after Blaming Pro 2nd Amendment Groups](http://alphanewsmn.com/gun-control-group-issues-apology-blaming-pro-2nd-amendment-groups/) and referring to their own experiences such as here: [Anti-Sharia, ANTIFA, and Assault](http://alphanewsmn.com/anti-sharia-antifa-assault/). Story selection always favors the right with almost daily negative coverage of Muslims, particularly Rep. Ilhan Omar. When reporting on Muslims, it is always negative, typically focusing on [crimes](https://alphanewsmn.com/moa-stabbing-suspect-pleads-guilty-pledges-allegiance-islamic-state/) they have committed or to [illicit fear](https://alphanewsmn.com/bachmann-touches-many-issues-waconia-speech/).
Alpha News routinely makes questionable claims such as this:
[New Evidence Supports Claims That Ilhan Omar Married Her Brother](https://alphanewsmn.com/new-evidence-supports-claims-that-ilhan-omar-married-her-brother/). This is an [unproven conspiracy theory](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ilhan-omar-marry-brother/). In general, Alpha News reports news that is always favorable to the right and denigrates the left. Further, they lack transparency as they do not disclose their conservative bias.
