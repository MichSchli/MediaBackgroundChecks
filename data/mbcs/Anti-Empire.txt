The website Anti-Empire promotes conspiracy theories and misinformation, particularly surrounding COVID-19. For example, an article titled
[“Bad News for Bill Gates: CDC Close to Declaring Covid-19 No Longer an Epidemic”](https://anti-empire.com/bad-news-for-bill-gates-cdc-close-to-declaring-covid-19-no-longer-an-epidemic/) criticizes Bill Gates and the pharmaceutical industry for promoting vaccinations and pushing for global control.
Anti-Empire cites a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that supposedly declares COVID-19 no longer an epidemic as evidence that the pandemic is overblown and lockdowns and vaccinations are unnecessary.
The article
[“Biden Accuses 70 Million Uninjected Americans of Slowing Economic Recovery”](https://anti-empire.com/biden-accuses-70-million-uninjected-americans-of-slowing-economic-recovery/) suggests that President Biden and the government are attacking unvaccinated Americans and using the pandemic to control the population. It also uses loaded language, such as “uninjected Americans.” Using the word “uninjected” instead of “unvaccinated” could be seen as an attempt to make vaccination sound more ominous or negative. Per quote, “Comedy gold. The lockdown brigade leader blames economic devastation on…his biggest victims.” Referring to President Biden as “The lockdown brigade leader” is an example of emotionally loaded language intended to influence the reader’s opinion.

In general, Anti-Empire is a right-biased website that promotes unproven conspiracy theories and pseudoscience, especially concerning Covid-19 and vaccinations.
