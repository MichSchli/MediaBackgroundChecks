Analysis / Bias
In review, 10tv.com reports local news primarily through TV news videos and accompanying text. Local news is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this:
[1 injured in drive-by shooting in Linden area](https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/linden-shooting/530-623c7ff4-de86-49b5-ba0f-57f833e90f06). National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other TEGNA TV stations.
10tv.com also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local Ohio politics through 10tv.com. Again, the wording is low-biased such as this:
[Ohio lawmakers join in call to invoke 25th Amendment to remove President Trump](https://www.10tv.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/ohio-lawmakers-join-in-call-to-invoke-25th-amendment/530-a89c60be-e49c-4782-b121-0fb6adda1aa2). Further, the website does not publish editorial commentary. Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
