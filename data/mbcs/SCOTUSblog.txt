Analysis / Bias
In review, the site live blogs as the Court announces opinions and grants cases and sometimes has information on the Courtâ€™s actions published before either the Court or any other news source. In reviewing this source, we could not find any use of loaded language, and all content was factually based. Most information is simply reporting what is happening. Headlines, for example, do not use emotion, such as this
[Majority appears poised to uphold Arizona voting rules.](https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/03/majority-appears-poised-to-uphold-arizona-voting-rules/) All information is properly sourced.
In general, this is a low-biased source that publishes court information as it happens.
