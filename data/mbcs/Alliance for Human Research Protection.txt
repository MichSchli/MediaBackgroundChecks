Analysis / Bias
The Alliance for Human Research Protection (AHRP) presents a narrative more aligned with pseudoscience than evidence-based scientific consensus. For example, the article”
[ Vaccine-Contaminated Mothers’ Milk is Poisoning Newborn Infants”](https://ahrp.org/newborn-infants-are-being-poisoned-by-vaccine-contaminated-mothers-milk/) claims that the COVID-19 vaccine contaminates breast milk, posing harm to infants, a claim that is not supported by mainstream [scientific research](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-713852380220) or health authorities.
Contrary to the article’s claims, health organizations such as the
[CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/) and [WHO](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/) have stated COVID-19 vaccines are [safe for breastfeeding women](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20that%20people%20who,the%20updated%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine.). These organizations base their guidance on [scientific studies](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/maternal-or-infant-illnesses/covid-19-and-breastfeeding.html#vaccine) showing no harmful effects on breastfed infants from the vaccine. The article’s framing is sensational and alarmist, evident in its title and language. Phrases like “being poisoned” and “experimental COVID-19 injections” are emotionally charged and designed to evoke fear and distrust in vaccines. This communication style is a common characteristic of pseudoscientific discourse, where the aim is often to persuade through emotion rather than factual accuracy.
Furthermore, the article broadly generalizes that public health officials and the pharmaceutical industry have embarked on a vaccination campaign “without confirmed evidence of safety.” This statement overlooks the extensive clinical trials and ongoing monitoring that form the basis of vaccine approval and recommendations.
In conclusion, the article from AHRP uses non-scientific language and unsupported claims, contradicting the established scientific consensus on COVID-19 vaccine safety for breastfeeding mothers. Therefore, It leans towards pseudoscience, not evidence-based facts.
Another article,
[“Weapons of mass deception: false claims, corrupted science”](https://ahrp.org/how-gmo-propaganda-perverted-science-suppressed-safety-concerns/) presents a critical view of the use of genetically engineered or modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture. AHRP suggests that the debate over GMOs is often misrepresented as a conflict between science and superstition, with opponents of GMOs labeled as anti-science. However, it argues that much opposition is based on scientific concerns about environmental and health hazards. While the article from the Alliance for Human Research Protection presents a critical perspective, it’s important to recognize that there is substantial scientific research supporting the safety and benefits of GMOs.
Numerous scientific bodies, including the
[National Academy of Sciences](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-academy-of-sciences-nas/), World Health Organization, and [American Medical Association](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-medical-association-ama/), have concluded that GMOs are safe to eat and can provide significant benefits, such as improved crop yields, enhanced nutritional content, and reduced need for pesticides.
In general, AHRP promotes pseudoscience and sometimes relies on
[poor sources](https://ahrp.org/childrens-health-defense-conference-nov-3-to-5-savannah-ga/) such as [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/), which has a poor record with fact-checkers.
