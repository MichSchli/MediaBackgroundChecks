Analysis / Bias
In review, Organic Facts reports on organic food and diets with a strong pro-organic bias, such as this:
[10 Amazing Benefits Of Purslane](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/vegetable/purslane.html). In this story, they claim [Purslane](https://www.seeker.com/woman-who-promoted-cancer-curing-diet-admits-hoax-1769792604.html) is an [anti-cancer nutrient](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) (they are not stating it cures cancer), among 9 other claims. None of which has credible long-term science behind it. Organic Facts also provides reviews of products that are subjective, but yet sourced and accurately described, such as this: [10 Best Flaxseed Oil Reviews 2019](https://www.organicfacts.net/reviews/best-flaxseed-oil.html). When it comes to [vaccinations,](https://www.organicfacts.net/yellow-fever.html) Organic Facts [promotes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) them as the first line of defense, with diet being second, which is appropriate. Although the website frequently disclaims that seeing a doctor and being properly diagnosed is best, they still rarely espouse [miracle type cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) such as [this](https://www.organicfacts.net/home-remedies/colon-cancer.html). In general, Organic Facts provides common-sense dietary advice; however, some of the claims are unproven or exaggerated.
