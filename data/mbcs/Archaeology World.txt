History
[Founded in 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/archaeology-world.com), Archaeology World is a website that publishes news about the field of archaeology. This website should not be confused with the credible academic journal [World Archaeology](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=rwar20). According to their [about page](https://www.archaeology-world.com/about-us/), the “goal of Archaeology World is to highlight recent archaeological discoveries, as well as offering alternative viewpoints and explanations of archaeology, mythology, religion, and history around the globe.”
Other than an about page, this source completely lacks transparency as articles do not have author names, and ownership is not disclosed. Further, the domain is registered privately and does not disclose the location.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Archaeology World publishes news about archaeology discoveries around the world. Headlines are not sensationalized and typically describe the article’s content such as this:
[3000-YEAR-OLD TROUSERS DISCOVERED IN CHINESE GRAVE OLDEST EVER FOUND](https://www.archaeology-world.com/3000-year-old-trousers-discovered-in-chinese-grave-oldest-ever-found/). This story is republished from the credible [Phys.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/phys-org/). However, other stories such as this, [Archaeology dig in Spain yields prehistoric ‘crystal weapons](https://www.archaeology-world.com/archaeology-dig-in-spain-yields-prehistoric-crystal-weapons/),’ does not provide any sourcing at all. Unfortunately, most stories on this website are unsourced and difficult to verify for the reader. In general, the stories on this website appear to be legitimate and factual; however, without sourcing and transparency, they are Questionable at best.
