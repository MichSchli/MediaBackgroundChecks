Analysis / Bias
Conservative Free Press is a news and opinion website/blog with an extreme right-wing bias in reporting. All stories favor the right and are anti-left. Conservative Free Press always uses strong loaded words in headlines and articles such as
[CNN Idiot: Trump Has to Pass DACA to Prove He Isn’t Racist](http://www.conservativefreepress.com/politics/cnn-idiot-trump-pass-daca-prove-isnt-racist/). While some articles are sourced to credible media outlets, others have zero sourcing, rendering them not credible. Articles that the Conservative Free Press does source are often spun to be unrecognizable to the intent of the source.
Editorially, all opinions favor the far left, such as this
[Pelosi Brings Strident Partisanship To New Low](https://www.conservativefreepress.com/2021/12/08/pelosi-brings-strident-partisanship-to-new-low/) and [Looks Like The Left-Wing Media Has Been Sucker Punched…Again](https://www.conservativefreepress.com/2021/11/30/looks-like-the-left-wing-media-has-been-sucker-punched-again/). While the site usually sources others, they promote [baseless election fraud claims](https://www.conservativefreepress.com/?s=election+fraud), and anti-covid vaccine propaganda such as this [Dr. Ben Carson Warns Kids Should ‘Absolutely Not’ Get COVID Vaccine](https://www.conservativefreepress.com/2021/11/05/dr-ben-carson-warns-kids-should-absolutely-not-get-covid-vaccine/).
