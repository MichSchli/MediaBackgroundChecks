History
[Launched in 2023](https://whois.domaintools.com/theleadingreport.com), the Leading Report is an anonymously published conservative news and opinion website. The website lacks transparency as it does not have an about page or describe ownership. The website appears to be from the United States.

Funded by / Ownership
Leading Report does not disclose ownership on the website. However, an
[investigation by IFCN fact-checker Science Feedback](https://science.feedback.org/who-is-behind-the-misleading-leading-report/) reveals that the Founders/Owners may be Jacob Cabe and/or Patrick Webb, neither of which have credentials in the fields of health and science. Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
Leading Report republishes or summarizes news and opinion stories from other sources. While they occasionally will rely on a credible source like
[NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) if it supports a conservative narrative, they usually use poor sources like [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and sometimes not all.
Articles and headlines contain highly emotional wording that favors the right and is conspiratorial in nature, such as this:
[Top Scientist Claims 13M Dead From COVID Vaccines](https://theleadingreport.com/2023/06/30/top-scientist-claims-13m-dead-from-covid-vaccines/). The source for this claim is Denis Rancourt, Ph.D., a former physics professor who was [dismissed](https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014607/http://www.media.uottawa.ca/mediaroom/news-details_1610.html) from Ottawa University. Note that his specialty is physics and not medicine. There is [no evidence](https://www.factcheck.org/2023/04/scicheck-no-evidence-excess-deaths-linked-to-vaccines-contrary-to-claims-online/) to support the claim that 13 million have died from the vaccine.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and promote conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and made-up news stories that lack evidence or proper sourcing, like this
[Cocaine Found at White House After Hunter Biden Visit](https://theleadingreport.com/2023/07/04/cocaine-found-at-white-house-after-hunter-biden-visit/). This headline implies that the cocaine found was Hunter Biden’s. There is no evidence or reports on this, and in fact, Leading Reports’ own article does not mention Hunter Biden. In general, this is a quackery-level pseudoscience and extreme right-biased website that lacks all basic credibility.
