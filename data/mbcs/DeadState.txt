Analysis / Bias
In review, DeadState reports news and opinion with a progressive liberal bias in reporting. Most stories favor the left, and some use moderately loaded words such as this:
[Twitter points out the irony of Sarah Sanders telling Democrats to ‘quit lying.’](https://deadstate.org/twitter-points-out-the-irony-of-sarah-sanders-telling-democrats-to-quit-lying/) This story is sourced adequately to [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/). Another example of loaded language can be found here: [Anti-LGBT Republican resigns after accusations he used gay dating app to meet way-younger men.](https://deadstate.org/anti-lgbt-republican-resigns-after-accusations-he-used-gay-dating-app-to-meet-way-younger-men/) This story is also properly sourced.
Editorially, DeadState usually favors the Left and reports negatively on the right. In particular, DeadState is not a fan of former President Trump:
[Christians finally condemn Trump’s racist rally — because he said ‘Goddamn’](https://deadstate.org/christians-finally-condemn-trumps-racist-rally-because-he-said-goddamn/) and [Former RNC Chairman: Christian ‘phonies’ sold out for ‘thirty pieces of silver’ under Trump](https://deadstate.org/former-rnc-chairman-christian-phonies-sold-out-for-thirty-pieces-of-silver-under-trump/). It should be noted that a lot of DeadState’s content comes from a secular perspective, which by default places them left in our current political system, which some may argue is not accurate.
