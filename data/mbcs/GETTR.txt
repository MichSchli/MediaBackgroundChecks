History
GETTR (Getting together) is a
[right-wing](https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2021/07/gettr-hentai-pornography-jason-miller/) social media app with a membership that caters to conservatives and those who align with the far-right. According to [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), originally, GETTR was founded a year ago as a Chinese-language social media network owned by [Exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/maga-app-bannon-chinese-billionaire-497767). At that time, GETTR was linked to G-TV Media ( [Gnews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gnews/)), which both Steve Bannon and Guo also own to promote anti-Chinese Communist Party content. Further, according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), G-TV media was [investigated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fundraising-at-company-tied-to-steve-bannon-and-guo-wengui-faces-probe-11597857467) by the FBI in 2020.
In June 2021, GETTR was rebranded and relaunched by
[Jason Miller](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/former-trump-aide-starts-social-media-platform-without-old-boss?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google) (former spokesman for former President Trump) as a “proMaga free speech platform.” [GETTR](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606), this time is marketing itself as “fighting cancel culture, promoting common sense, defending free speech, challenging social media monopolies, and creating a true marketplace of ideas.” GETTR is headquartered in New York, and the site will be officially launched on July 4th. [Tim Murtaugh](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606) is the consultant. The site is inspired by Twitter, and posts will be 777 characters long.
It is not clear whether former president
[Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2018/08/18/trump-says-social-media-biased-against-conservatives/) will set up an account or not.
Funding / Ownership
Ownership is unclear, but Jason Miller serves as the CEO and exiled Chinese billionaire
[Guo Wengui](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/maga-app-bannon-chinese-billionaire-497767) provided original seed funding. [According](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/trump-social-app-gettr-imposters-1235010235/) to [Variety](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/variety-magazine/), “Gettr is developed by a company called [Chainnov Inc](https://www.bizapedia.com/de/chainnov-inc.html).,” which was incorporated last summer. There is very little information on Chainnov Inc.; however, they are incorporated in Deleware, USA, known as a [tax haven](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/dont-blame-delaware/502904/).
Analysis / Bias
In review, GETTR is a social media platform that caters to conservatives and those banned from other networks for various reasons. An early review shows that right-wing media personalities are signing up, such as Steve Bannon, Representative Jim Jordan, and Alex Jones. News sources that have signed up consist of mostly questionable and conspiracy sources such as
[One America News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2020/05/04/daily-source-bias-check-one-america-news-oan/), [Newstarget](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-target/), [Newsmax](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/), and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). We also found that many news sources and personalities are fake accounts using the names. This makes it difficult to tell what is real.
GETTR does not publish a curated newsfeed like many other social media platforms; however, you can follow news sources such as those mentioned above and have news delivered to your timeline. We searched to see if any major credible media outlets have signed up and could not find any at this time. This may change in the future, but currently, only low-quality questionable sources populate GETTR. In general, the content of posts mostly appeals to the right and often lacks credibility.
Failed Fact Checks
- We will add them here as they come in.
Overall, GETTR is Far Right Biased based on the news sources that have signed up to date. We also rate them Low factual and Questionable based on the news sources using the service having very poor track records with promoting conspiracy theories and failing fact checks. (M.
