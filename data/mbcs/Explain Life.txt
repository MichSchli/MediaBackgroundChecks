Analysis / Bias
In review, Explain Life does not produce original content, but rather heavily quotes other news stories and interjects right biased opinions. Most articles contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[It’s Happening: Barack Obama’s Worst Nightmare Was Just Revealed](https://explainlife.com/its-happening-barack-obamas-worst-nightmare-was-just-revealed-17126/). Most of the time the news stories they are republishing are derived from far right sources that we have deemed questionable such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which has failed numerous fact checks. Story selection always favors the right and in particular [President Trump](https://explainlife.com/u-s-senate-gives-trump-154-reasons-to-smile-schumer-is-pissed-17076/) and frequently [denigrates the left.](https://explainlife.com/joe-bidens-campaign-slips-up-they-just-implicated-obama-in-scandal-17122/)
When not reporting extreme right biased opinions, Explain Life publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience such as this:
[U.S. Water Fluoridation: A Forced Experiment that Needs to End](https://explainlife.com/u-s-water-fluoridation-a-forced-experiment-that-needs-to-end-6977/). The risk of fluoride has been [debunked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815618/) numerous times. They also promote ridiculous conspiracies such as the Clinton Body Count, [Isn’t it obvious? Jeffrey Epstein Was Murdered Because Dead Men Don’t Talk](https://explainlife.com/isnt-it-obvious-jeffrey-epstein-was-murdered-because-dead-men-dont-talk-16036/). This story is sourced to the discredited Mike Adams from [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/), a well known purveyor of fake news, conspiracies and dangerous pseudoscience. Finally, they report on conspiracies regarding [Joe Biden’s health](https://explainlife.com/obamas-doctor-goes-public-admits-damning-truth-about-joe-bidens-health-16645/) and the [Deep State](https://explainlife.com/deep-states-wapo-and-nyt-got-paid-to-publish-putins-and-chinese-propaganda-15939/). In general, this is not a credible source for information.
