History
Founded in 2010, NRL News Today, or National Right to Life News, is a news website associated with the
[National Right to Life Committee (NRLC)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-right-to-life-committee-nrlc/). This national anti-abortion organization states its [mission](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/52-0986195) as “Devoted to disseminating information and support for pro-life issues.” Furthermore, the National Right to Life Committee also lobbies to put in place pro-life policies and states its [purpose](https://www.nrlc.org/takeaction/) as “to elect pro-life men and women to Congress and the White House who will lead our country back to the day when innocent human life is protected by our laws.” They are headquartered in Washington, D.C., and [Carol Tobias](https://www.nrlc.org/6-2/national-right-to-life-president-carol-tobias/) is the organization’s president.
The NRL News Today website lacks transparency as they do not provide an about page or disclose that the National Right to Life Committee owns them.

Analysis / Bias
In review, NRL News Today publishes news from a conservative perspective that promotes opposition to abortion, euthanasia, and RU486 birth control. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded wording that advances their agenda, such as this
[Judge opens door for dangerous chemical abortifacient to be mailed or delivered to pregnant women](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/2020/07/judge-opens-door-for-dangerous-chemical-abortifacient-to-be-mailed-or-delivered-to-pregnant-women/). This story offers minimal hyperlinked sourcing.
Other stories offer strongly loaded negative emotional language towards Planned Parenthood, such as this
[Another staff meltdown at a Planned Parenthood affiliate](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/2020/07/another-staff-meltdown-at-a-planned-parenthood-affiliate/). This story provides one link to [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). NRL News also republishes news from other anti-abortion websites such as [LifeSiteNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/) and [Live Action](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/live-action/), which have failed numerous fact checks.
NRL News Today has also
[published misinformation](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/2019/10/top-10-abortion-myths-4-abortion-has-no-side-effects-for-women/) claiming that “Abortion has been linked to an increased risk for post-abortive women being diagnosed with breast cancer.” According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), “After adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors, the researchers found that induced abortion(s) had no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer. The size of this study and how it was done provide good evidence that induced abortion does not affect a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer.”
Editorially, NRL News Today routinely favors a conservative Christian perspective and frequently praises former President Donald Trump, such as this:
[Pro-abortionists count on pro-life support for President Trump diminishing. They could not be more wrong](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/2020/07/pro-abortionists-count-on-pro-life-support-for-president-trump-diminishing-they-could-not-be-more-wrong/) while aggressively denigrating the left [Joe Biden’s unbridled abortion extremism](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/2020/07/joe-bidens-unbridled-abortion-extremism/). In general, they publish news that is frequently misleading and/or false with a strong conservative editorial bias.
