Analysis / Bias
In review, Mashable publishes aggregated and original content related to technology, lifestyle, and entertainment. Headlines and articles typically contain moderately loaded language and are properly sourced such as this:
[Meghan Markle opens up about the impact media scrutiny has had on her](https://mashable.com/article/meghan-markle-struggle-behind-scenes/).
When reporting on politics, Mashable has a negative opinion of former President Trump, as evidenced by this article
[The Turkish president apparently threw Trump’s ridiculous letter in the trash](https://mashable.com/article/trump-turkey-letter-erdogan-trash/), and in this article, [President Trump just literally begged us to impeach him](https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-tweets-impeach-president/). Further, they also report negatively on conservatives; [even](https://mashable.com/article/jon-kyl-facebook-conservative-bias-audit/) [ a Republican study can’t confirm anti-conservative bias on Facebook](https://mashable.com/article/jon-kyl-facebook-conservative-bias-audit/). In general, political content always favors the left, with Mashable not clearly labeling opinion content.
