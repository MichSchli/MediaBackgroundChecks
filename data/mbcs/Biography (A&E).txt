Analysis / Bias
In review,
[Biography](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092322/) publishes information on the lives and careers of “notable figures in the history of entertainment, sports, arts, science, politics, and warfare” Biography.com [editors](https://www.biography.com/author/bio-staff) typically specialize in entertainment and celebrity journalism.
When publishing biographies, Biography.com often sources to itself and the History Channel, which is part of A+E Network
[here](https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/al-capone) or A&E [here](https://www.biography.com/news/famous-mobsters-mugshots-photos). A&E and the History Channel tend to interview people close to the subject to give their perspective on the person; therefore, generally, the biographies are reported factually and with minimal bias. For example, when covering political figures such as [Donald Trump Jr.](https://www.biography.com/personality/donald-trump-jr), they provide examples of his controversies, like meeting with the Russians but do editorialize the content. In general, there is little bias, and all information is sourced correctly.
