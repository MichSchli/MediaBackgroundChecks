History
[Founded in 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/vaccinesafety.info), Vaccine Safety Info is an anonymously published website that promotes anti-Vaccine propaganda. The [about page](https://vaccinesafety.info/home-2/) states, “The intent of this site is to curate news, research, perspectives, and data on vaccines and their safety to support people being able to make informed decisions.” The website completely lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership, authors, or editors.

Funded by / Ownership
Vaccine Safety Info completely lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership or funding. As of this date, they do not appear to have a monetization strategy.
Analysis / Bias
Vaccine Safety Info routinely publishes conspiracies and pseudoscience regarding vaccines. They do not produce original content but rather curate content from questionable sources such as
[Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/) [17 Pharma Henchmen Who Voted to Experiment on Your Kids](https://vaccinesafety.info/2021/11/10/17-pharma-henchmen-who-voted-to-experiment-on-your-kids-and-how-to-shun-them-childrens-health-defense/). While they state, “The intent of this site is to curate news, research, perspectives, and data on vaccines and their safety to support people being able to make informed decisions,” this is not true as they never publish any scientific reports that are positive (factual) about vaccines.
For example, they typically publish so-called research from Pseudoscience websites such as
[GreenMedInfo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/greenmedinfo/), which has an abysmal track record with fact-checkers: [22 Studies and Reports Raise Doubts About COVID Vaccine Efficacy and](https://vaccinesafety.info/2021/11/10/22-studies-and-reports-raise-doubts-about-covid-vaccine-efficacy-and/). In general, Vaccine Safety Info promotes anti-vaccine information and is rarely factual.
