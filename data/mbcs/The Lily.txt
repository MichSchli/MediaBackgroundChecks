Analysis / Bias
In review, The Lily uses moderate loaded words in their headlines and articles. For example,
[Muslim women sound off on social media about being period shamed during Ramadan.](https://www.thelily.com/muslim-women-sound-off-on-social-media-about-being-period-shamed-during-ramadan/?tid=more_from_lily) Each article is well sourced to credible media. Most of which fall on the left side of the political spectrum, such as [Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/) and the [Huffington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/) to name a few. Story selection almost always favors the left but is factually based. A factual search reveals they have never failed a fact check.
