Analysis / Bias
In review, Imprimis uses minimal loaded words in their headlines and minimally editorializes the speech transcripts they publish. However, most speakers are conservative and present opinions with a right-wing bias. They do not use outside sourcing of information as the source is the speaker. Imprimis speakers are not always factual in their statements. For example, in January 2010, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan spoke at Hillsdale College and claimed that the Affordable Care Act will result in
[rationing of healthcare](https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/health-care-in-a-free-society/). According to Politifact, this is a [mostly false statement](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/23/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-15-unelected-unaccountable-bureaucr/).
