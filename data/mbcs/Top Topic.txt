Analysis / Bias
In review, Top Topic usually republishes right biased articles from other sources without giving credit (Plagiarism). For example, this story:
[AOC Might Be In Even Bigger Trouble Than Jussie Smollett For Her Lies About Boyfriend](https://www.toptopic.club/2019/02/aoc-might-be-in-even-bigger-trouble.html) is taken [word for word](https://thefederalistpapers.org/opinion/aoc-might-even-bigger-trouble-jussie-smollett-lies-boyfriend) from the Questionable [Federalist Papers Project](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist-papers-project/). In general, there is zero sourcing of information on this website. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left. They also frequently publish pro-Trump propaganda stories from other questionable sources. Further, Top Topic has a [Pants on Fire Claim](https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/jan/15/blog-posting/no-trump-family-did-not-donate-1-billion-border-wa/) from an IFCN fact-checker.
