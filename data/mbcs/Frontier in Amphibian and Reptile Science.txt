In review, Frontiers in Amphibian and Reptile Science is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to the field of Allergic Diseases. The journal primarily publishes research such as this
[Editor’s Showcase: Behavior, Evolution and Ecology](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/48556/editors-showcase-behavior-evolution-and-ecology).
[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
However, Frontiers in Amphibian and Reptile Science is a credible scientific journal, as we have not found any controversy or significant retractions. Although, Frontiers Media has
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
