Analysis / Bias
In review, the Natural Health Response promotes
[anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this [NEVER Get the Flu! (No Vaccine Necessary)](https://naturalhealthresponse.com/never-get-the-flu-no-vaccine-necessary/) and conspiracies where the Government is withholding [cancer cures](https://allianceforadvancedhealth.com/?s=cancer+cure) for the benefit of Big Pharma. Natural Health Response Health does publish credible info, but overall, we rate them a Conspiracy-Pseudoscience site based on promoting anti-vaccination propaganda and government conspiracies.
