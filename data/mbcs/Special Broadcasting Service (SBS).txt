Analysis / Bias
In review, SBS News reports Australian and world news. Articles and headlines use moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Victoria announces the State of Disaster as Melbourne enters drastic Stage 4 coronavirus lockdown](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/victoria-announces-state-of-disaster-as-melbourne-enters-drastic-stage-4-coronavirus-lockdown). This story is appropriately sourced to the Victoria State Government. World news is generally sourced through news wires such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, SBS does not directly publish op-eds; however, they report on politics from a liberal perspective. For example, they frequently report negatively on conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison, such as
[Scott Morrison’s high-flying $3.1 million travel and accommodation costs revealed](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/exclusive-scott-morrison-s-high-flying-3-1-million-travel-and-accommodation-costs-revealed). SBS also advocates for [legal gay marriage](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/same-sex-marriage-around-the-world-how-many-countries-have-legalised-it) and expresses concern for [climate change](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/a-huge-challenge-in-front-of-us-as-individuals-what-should-we-be-doing-about-climate-change). Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 70% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/australia) and 12% do not, ranking them #2 in trust of the major Australian news providers. The news is generally reported factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
