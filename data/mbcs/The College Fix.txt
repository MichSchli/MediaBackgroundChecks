Analysis / Bias
In review, The College Fix reports news on higher education as well as politics from a conservative perspective. Many articles focus on political correctness and utilize moderate emotional language such as this:
[Student affairs officers have low view of students’ understanding of free speech, survey finds](https://www.thecollegefix.com/student-affairs-officers-have-low-view-of-students-understanding-of-free-speech-survey-finds/). The website also publishes news stories from other sources, including [Inside Higher Education](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/inside-higher-ed/) such as this: [After sudden coronavirus evictions, universities demand students pay to get their stuff back](https://www.thecollegefix.com/after-sudden-coronavirus-evictions-universities-demand-students-pay-to-get-their-stuff-back/). For the most part news articles are reasonably sourced to credible media outlets and are not overly opinionated.
Editorially, The College Fix appropriately labels opinion content. Virtually all op-eds reviewed favors conservative positions such as
[anti-abortion](https://www.thecollegefix.com/californias-public-universities-are-now-in-the-abortion-business/) positions and negative reporting on Feminism: [Guilt-first feminists accuse school dance policy of promoting ‘rape culture’](https://www.thecollegefix.com/guilt-first-feminists-accuse-school-dance-policy-of-promoting-rape-culture/). In general story selections strongly aligns with the right and are sometimes not factual.
