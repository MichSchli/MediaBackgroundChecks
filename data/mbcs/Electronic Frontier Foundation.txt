Analysis / Bias
The EFF provides funds for legal defenses of individuals and new technologies from abusive legal threats. They also work to expose government interference and corruption. The website states their issues as Free Speech, Privacy, Creativity and Innovation, Transparency, and International and Security. EFF also provides press releases, events, information on legal cases, and white papers.
The organization publishes news and analysis with minimal bias, such as this

The EFF’s Deeplinks blog delves into politics, especially as it relates to cases against the government. For example, they have provided analysis on what the Trump administration meant for the first amendment and civil rights, often with a negative tone [Dangers of Trump’s Executive Order Explained](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/dangers-trumps-executive-order-explained). However, when reporting on Democratic President Joe Biden, they have a more favorable tone asking him to change Trump-era policies [EFF’s Top Recommendations for the Biden Administration](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/effs-top-recommendations-biden-administration). All information reviewed is properly sourced and factual and leans left in bias.
