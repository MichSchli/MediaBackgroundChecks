Analysis / Bias
In review, the Financial Times primarily reports economic news with a minimally biased tone such as this:
[Trump calls on China to drop levies on US farm products](https://www.ft.com/content/37e89f3a-3c8e-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0). This story, like all others on the website, is appropriately sourced. Editorially, the Financial Times sticks to economics and how politics impacts it. There is, again, minimal bias in reporting. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 56% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 12% do not, ranking them #4 in trust of the major UK news providers. In general, FT reports straight news with minimal bias and proper sourcing.
