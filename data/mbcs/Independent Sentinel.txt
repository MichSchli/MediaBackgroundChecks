History
Founded in 2011, the Independent Sentinel is a conservative news and opinion website/blog. According to the Independent Sentinel’s
[about page](http://www.independentsentinel.com/about-us/), they “provide news, opinion, and commentary, analysis, factual and original content, mostly political, usually right-of-center, for a Conservative, Libertarian, Republican audience.” The website is operated by the pseudonym [Sara Noble](https://www.independentsentinel.com/author/freebird/). The website lists other authors and provides [biographical information](https://www.independentsentinel.com/about/) for each. On this page, Sara Noble indicates that she was the former copy editor for This Week Magazine and “for 33 years, worked in education as a teacher of English and Special Education, and spent years as an elementary principal, secondary principal, central office administrator, and consultant.”
Mrs. Noble reached out to us via email and provided her real name to protect for privacy. She states that she uses the pseudonym because “many of my family members are liberals and don’t want their last name out there on a center-right blog.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Independent Sentinel does not produce original news stories but summarizes and opines news stories from other sources. Headlines and articles frequently use emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[Pelosi shamelessly claims Schiff’s parody were the “President’s words](https://www.independentsentinel.com/pelosi-shamelessly-claims-schiffs-parody-were-the-presidents-words/).” This story is sourced back to videos and tweets. In another story, [Dems’ Impeachment Narrative Is Blowing Up & It’s Getting Better & Better](https://www.independentsentinel.com/dems-impeachment-narrative-is-blowing-up-its-getting-better-better/), information is sourced to mainstream outlets such as the [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). Regarding sourcing in general, they often utilize credible mainstream sources; however, on occasion, they use poor sources such as Rush Limbaugh, who had an abysmal track record with fact-checkers, and the Questionable [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and often denigrate the left, such as this:
[“Damning, Brutal, Explosive” Testimony by Bill Taylor Was 100% GOSSIP](https://www.independentsentinel.com/damning-brutal-explosive-testimony-by-bill-taylor-was-100-gossip/). The website also often reports on the successes of the Trump Administration: [Trump’s Leading USA to Economic Victory Over a Badly Slumping China-Shh!](https://www.independentsentinel.com/trumps-leading-usa-to-economic-victory-over-a-badly-slumping-china-shh/). However, the Independent Sentinel fully disclaims the site is geared toward the right-leaning audience and, therefore, is not deceptive.
In 2020, the Independent Sentinel promoted false or misleading information regarding covid-19. For example, they promoted a danish mask study
[Danish study finds masks don’t do much](https://www.independentsentinel.com/danish-study-finds-masks-dont-do-much/) that has been rated as [Unsupported](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/danish-face-mask-study-did-not-show-that-masks-were-ineffective-at-reducing-spread-of-covid-19-study-was-underpowered-and-results-were-inconclusive/) by IFCN fact-checker [Health Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-feedback/). They have also published false information about an [Asthma medication](https://www.independentsentinel.com/texas-doctor-discusses-what-has-cured-his-cov-patients/) that can cure Covid-19. [This is false](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/asthma-medicine-not-proven-as-covid-19-cure/). During and after the 2020 Presidential Election, they also promoted election fraud conspiracies such as this [Read forensics report on Dominion software “intentionally designed” for fraud](https://www.independentsentinel.com/read-forensics-report-on-dominion-software-intentionally-designed-for-fraud/). This is misinformation as there has [not been proof](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=dominion) that Dominion committed fraud. In fact, [Dominion is suing](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/960302843/dominion-voting-systems-suing-giuliani-for-defamation) those who have made these false claims.
