Analysis / Bias
In review, primarily, PR Newswire collects press releases from companies and organizations and then republishes them without alteration. Although they publish press releases from left and right-biased organizations, they do not select or favor releases. Besides publishing press releases, they also publish content geared toward helping companies market their brands. In general, PR Newswire remains neutral and publishes press releases without bias. While the Press Releases may be questionable, PR Newswire is a credible source for press releases without alteration.
