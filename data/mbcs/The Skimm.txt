Analysis / Bias
In review, TheSkimm publishes short-form news stories for the web and their mobile apps. The stories are easy to read and targeted to female millennials. Headlines are typically low-biased and use few loaded words such as this:
[Daily Skimm: White Supremacy, Puerto Rico, and Amazon’s New (Fed)Ex.](https://www.theskimm.com/news/daily-skimm/2019-08-08) In this article, the Daily Skimm covers three topics very quickly and directly to the point through credible sourcing, such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/).
They also produce stand-alone stories that generally lean slightly left, such as
[Food insecurity and the role of climate change: What to know](https://www.theskimm.com/news/guides/food-insecurity). Again, this is appropriately sourced to the USDA, the EPA, and [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/). Editorially, story selection tends to favor the left slightly.
