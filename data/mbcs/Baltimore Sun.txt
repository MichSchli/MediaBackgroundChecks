Analysis / Bias
The Baltimore Sun publishes news with minimally loaded language through the use of journalists. Headlines reflect the content of the story such as this
[Baltimore County Public Schools investigating Pikesville High principal’s alleged ‘highly offensive’ recording](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/01/17/pikesville-principal-alleged-recording/). All information is well-sourced to credible media and investigative journalists. National news is primarily derived from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, the Baltimore Sun almost always
[endorses Democratic candidates](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-baltimore-sun-editorial-board-endorsements-storygallery.html), and opinion pieces consistently lean left such as this [Climate change must be on top of the General Assembly agenda this year | STAFF COMMENTARY](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/01/09/maryland-general-assembly-climatete-change-staff-commentary/). However, with a change in ownership with known ties to conservative causes, it is not yet clear what impact it will have on the [editorial direction](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/economy/baltimore-sun-david-smith-sinclair-owner-F77S3D47ORD7LNEPZ7PJCXSLWM/?fbclid=IwAR3_MuBhzSbK9xdMBm7z20U9YgS6yx5S3Ay5KEf4KYLD3J3GVIw1DIlrieE) of the Baltimore Sun. For example, [Tax records show](https://wtop.com/baltimore/2024/01/the-baltimore-sun-is-returning-to-local-ownership-with-a-buyer-who-has-made-his-politics-clear/) Smith’s foundation has donated to the conservative group [Project Veritas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-veritas/), which is best known for making hidden camera stings on media and liberal figures.
