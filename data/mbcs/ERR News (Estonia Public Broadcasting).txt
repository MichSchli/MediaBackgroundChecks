Analysis / Bias
Estonia ranks 4th on the
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) press [freedom index](https://rsf.org/en/estonia).
According to
[Freedom House Report](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/estonia), “There are two press councils in the country. The Estonian Public Broadcaster (ERR) is supervised by the Public Broadcasting Council (RHN). Their members—by law, four media professionals and one representative from each parliamentary faction—are elected by Parliament. In 2012, after the terms of the four media professionals expired, the ruling coalition replaced them with its appointees without a public debate.”
In review, ERR News uses credible sources such as
[The Baltic News Service (BNS).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_News_Service) When reporting U.S. news, ERR News generally uses neutral wording: “ [Pence to meet with heads of Baltic states in Tallinn next week](http://news.err.ee/609480/pence-to-meet-with-heads-of-baltic-states-in-tallinn-next-week). Editorially, most articles and opinion pieces are relatively balanced, with writers offering differing perspectives. There is a very slight right-leaning bias in editorials, but not enough to move this source from the Least Biased category.
