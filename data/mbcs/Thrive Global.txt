Analysis / Bias
Thrive Global reports on stress, sleep, mental health, and general well-being. The Thrive Global staff writes articles as well as 130K members who can publish unedited work. They also republish articles from outside sources such as
[Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/) and the blogging platform [Medium](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/medium/). Articles and headlines use moderate loaded emotional language such as this [As the Pandemic Drags On, I Can’t Take Much More of This](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/work-from-home-diary-quarantine-coronavirus-reopening-fatigue-burnout/).
A review of staff-produced content reveals factual information with a slight left-leaning bias. However, under the Community section of the website, where members publish articles, there is the frequent publication of misinformation. Many of the articles in this section promote pseudoscience, such as this
[5 Fitness Industry Myths: DEBUNKED!](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/5-fitness-industry-myths-debunked/) In this article, they claim that Aspartame causes cancer. This has been [debunked](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-aspartame-dangers/) for many years. They also promote miracle cures for Covid-19, such as this [How to Protect Yourself From Coronavirus](https://web.archive.org/web/20210211190653/https://thriveglobal.com/stories/how-to-protect-yourself-from-corona-virus/). In this article, they claim that a high alkaline diet will overwhelm the Coronavirus. First, diet does [not change the body’s PH level](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/features/Pages/2019-05-06-pHear-pHactor-debunking-the-alkaline-diet.aspx), and second, it [would not ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/05/06/fact-check-alkaline-diet-not-cure-coronavirus/3068027001/)impact Covid-19.
Editorially, most stories favor the left and denigrate the right such as this
[What Happens When PTSD Turns into Post-Trump Stress Disorder?](https://thriveglobal.com/stories/what-happens-when-ptsd-turns-into-post-trump-stress-disorder/) In general, Thrive Global is a left-biased website that frequently promotes pseudoscience and misinformation.
