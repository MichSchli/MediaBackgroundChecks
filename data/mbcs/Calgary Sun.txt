Funded by / Ownership
The Calgary Sun is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his involvement in hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the
[National Observer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-observer-canada/), PostMedia is in a [downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Calgary Sun reports local news with minimal to moderate bias in wording such as this:
[Calgary mom charged with assaulting a child while livestreaming video game](https://calgarysun.com/news/crime/calgary-police-investigate-online-video-showing-alleged-child-abuse). The Sun also re-publishes articles from credible sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/); however, they poorly source their news. When they do, they utilize their flagship publication, the [Toronto Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/toronto-sun/), and rarely use hyperlinks. Further, The Sun also publishes its daily [Sunshine Girls](https://torontosun.com/sunshine-girls/top-sunshine-girls-who-were-the-most-popular-models-in-november) section, adapted from [British tabloids.](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/01/20/end-of-an-era-uk-sun-drops-topless-page-3-girls.html)
Editorially, CEO Paul Godfrey ordered all 16 major Postmedia papers, including the Calgary Sun, to
[endorse](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/11/09/postmedia-let-down-readers-by-dictating-election-endorsements-honderich.html) Stephen Harper of the Conservative Party in the 2015 federal elections. Further, when it comes to science, The Sun [casts doubt](https://calgarysun.com/opinion/columnists/guest-opinion-science-doesnt-support-climate-alarmism) on [human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and thus rejects the consensus of science. Finally, editorials are frequently negative when reporting on liberals and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, such as this: [Bell: Wounded Trudeau tries to save his butt](https://calgarysun.com/opinion/columnists/bell-wounded-trudeau-tries-to-save-his-butt).
