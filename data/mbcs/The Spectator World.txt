Analysis / Bias
In review, The Spectator primarily covers politics and culture with a right-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines and articles usually contain moderately loaded language that favors the right such as this:
[Left is the new right](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/left-new-right-wing-wokeyleaks/) and this [What does Vladimir Putin have on Joe Biden?](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/putin-joe-biden-cyber-attacks-hacking/) Information contained in articles is typically properly sourced to credible media outlets or via direct quotes. The Spectator has also [published misleading articles](https://climatefeedback.org/outlet/the-spectator/) regarding climate change.
Editorially, The Spectator is generally
[Eurosceptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism) in outlook, favoring close ties with the United States rather than with the European Union and supporting Israel. In British politics, they are generally strongly opposed to the Labour Party and favor the Conservative Party. In the USA, they have an unfavorable opinion of Democratic President Joe Biden, as evidenced above.
