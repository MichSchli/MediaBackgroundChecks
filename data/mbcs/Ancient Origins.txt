Analysis / Bias
In review, Ancient Origins publishes news and information regarding ancient history and human origins. Although many articles on this website are factual and pro-science, some fall under the pseudoarchaeology and pseudohistory tag. It should be noted that the website disclaims they publish alternative viewpoints. This story, for example, is appropriately sourced and true
[Lost temple of the Pharaoh Ptolemy IV found in Egypt](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/ptolemy-iv-0012670). While this story promotes ancient aliens speculation: [Did Ancient Aliens Impart Advanced Astronomical Knowledge to the Dogon Tribe](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-mysterious-phenomena/did-ancient-aliens-impart-advanced-astronomical-knowledge-dogon-tribe-021403)? In this story, they report on current alien visitations [Ex US Military Veteran claims to have worked with aliens](https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-general/ex-us-military-veteran-claims-have-worked-aliens-00283). This story originates from the website openminds.tv. In general, Ancient Origins does what it states in its mission. It publishes credible, verifiable information alongside unproven alternative pseudoscience.
