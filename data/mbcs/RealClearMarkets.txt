Analysis / Bias
RealClearMarkets reports and links to news from other outlets and also produces its own original stories.
In review, RealClearMarkets frequently uses emotionally loaded headlines such as this:
[The SECâ€™s ESG Disclosures Harm Consumers, Gift Political Allies](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2021/08/04/the_secs_esg_disclosures_harm_consumers_gift_political_allies_788397.html), and [The CDC Exercises Arbitrary Power While Vandalizing Science](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2021/07/30/the_cdc_exercises_arbitrary_power_while_vandalizing_science_787694.html).
Generally, story selection moderately favors the Right, and RealClearMarkets takes a Pro-Trump/conservative stance on most issues. RealClearMarkets typically sources their information to credible sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/); however, they also source factually mixed sources such as [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) and the [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/). They also occasionally rely on Questionable sources such as [Quillette](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quillette/) [Economic Growth Makes Us Better Off & Just Better](https://quillette.com/2021/08/19/luxury-belief-systems-and-economic-stagnation-the-recipe-for-our-discontent/) Andrew Potter, Quillette. Finally, RealClearMarkets is skeptical when it some to human-influenced [climate change](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/search/?q=climate+change). In general, most news is factual and holds a right of center bias editorially.
