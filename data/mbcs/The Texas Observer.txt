Analysis / Bias
In review, The Texas Observer reports news with a left-leaning bias in story selection. There is the moderate use of loaded words such as this:
[Despite Trump and Rick Perry’s Best Efforts, Another Coal Plant Eats the Dust in Texas](https://www.texasobserver.org/despite-trump-and-rick-perrys-best-efforts-another-coal-plant-eats-the-dust-in-texas/). Although this story does convey emotional wording, it is well-sourced to credible and factual sources.
The Texas Observer highlights a few different political areas, such as Pro-Immigration positions and pro-environment and pro-civil rights. Essentially, they support positions championed by the left. Editorially they are left-biased and fact-based.
