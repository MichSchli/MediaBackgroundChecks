History
Vice Magazine was founded in 1994 by Shane Smith, Suroosh Alvi, and Gavin McInnes in Montreal, Canada. In this
[interview](http://mcgillnews.mcgill.ca/s/1762/news/interior.aspx?sid=1762&gid=2&pgid=933) with Suroosh Alvi, he details how Vice was born. In 1998, the partners sold part of Vice to Montreal software magnate Richard Szalwinski; however, soon, they repurchased the magazine. Once called “Voice of Montreal,” they eventually changed the name to Vice. In 1999, Vice [relocated its base](https://www.fastcompany.com/3045125/before-the-billions-watch-this-1999-short-doc-on-vices-move-to-nyc) to New York City and became [Vice Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Media), which grew into a digital media company that publishes online and in print magazines and expanded into millennial-driven media consisting of a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing imprint and more.
Its news division, Vice News, launched in 2013 and focused on news and current events. Currently,
[Nancy Dubuc](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/nancy-dubuc-shane-smith-vice-media-ceo-1202725477/) is the CEO, and Shane Smith is the Executive Chairman. According to its about page, Suroosh Alvi & Shane Smith are listed as owners, whereas [Gavin McInnes](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/02/04/gavin-mcinnes-vice-jewish-canadaland_n_4724230.html) is not listed since he left due to [“creative differences.”](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/gavin-mcinnes-path-to-the-far-rightfrontier/article36024918/) [Gavin McInnes](https://www.thedailybeast.com/proud-boys-founder-gavin-mcinnes-quits-far-right-group) later founded the Proud Boys, which is defined as a [hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys).

[announced](https://newsfactsnetwork.com/2023/05/15/vice-media-files-for-bankruptcy-to-enable-sale-to-lenders/) that Vice Media filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and will be sold.

According to Forbes,
[Shane Smith](https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2017/06/20/vice-medias-shane-smith-is-now-a-billionaire/#7eab78c611ba) owns approximately (20%), and the rest of the [shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Media) belongs to [The Walt Disney Company,](https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/disney-vice-media-21st-century-stake-1202642054/) A&E Networks, TPG Capital (the private equity group), and 21st Century Fox. Vice Media missed revenue targets by $100m, and according to a Forbes [article](https://www.ft.com/content/610eff08-e3b5-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee), “ Disney wrote down $157m of its investment in Vice,” which indicates a sign of trouble “for the youth-focused media company.” Further, CNBC [reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/disney-takes-157-million-write-down-on-vice-media.html) Vice is reportedly reducing staff by 15%. Vice News is funded primarily through advertising.

In review, Vice News offers a progressive liberal perspective in reporting such as
[“Millennials Don’t Love Capitalism but Can’t Stop Using Amazon.”](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mq5p/millennials-dont-love-capitalism-but-cant-stop-using-amazon) Vice News has an anti-Trump tone in their articles, such as [This Is What It Takes for a Trump Voter to Change Their Mind](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/439ppj/this-is-what-it-takes-for-a-trump-voter-to-change-their-mind) and [“Trump Foundation is shutting down after the New York AG called it “little more than a checkbook” for Trump.”](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/qvqapp/trump-foundation-is-shutting-down-after-the-new-york-ag-called-it-little-more-than-a-checkbook-for-trump) However, Vice News utilizes credible sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), ocf.berkeley.edu, [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), ag.ny.gov, [Forbes,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) [Washington Examiner,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) [Business Insider](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/), census.gov, and the [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). More stories generally favor the left and present a more favorable left-leaning perspective on issues.
