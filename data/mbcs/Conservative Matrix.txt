Analysis / Bias
In review, the Conservative Matrix publishes commentary and summarized news stories by Phoenix Brooks. Articles and headlines often use loaded emotional language that favors the right such as this
[[VIDEO] Trump Derangement Syndrome On Full Display As Tik Tok “Influencer” Screams And Rants At Her Camera](http://conservativematrix.com/trump-derangement-syndrome-full-display-tik-tok-influencer-screams-camera-dav/). This story is sourced from a Tik Tok video. In fact, many stories revolve around video, often from unknown sources. When it comes to sourcing, they utilize poor sources such as Pat Gray from [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), Ben Shapiro from the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/), and [Campus Reform](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/campus-reform/), all of which we rate Mixed for factual reporting due to failed fact checks.
Editorially, all stories favor the Right and, in particular,
[Donald Trump](http://conservativematrix.com/video-students-support-removing-trump-25th-amendment-dont-know-dav/) and frequently denigrate the left with stories such as this [[VIDEO] Ted Cruz Obliterates Twitter CEO At Congressional Hearing](http://conservativematrix.com/ted-cruz-obliterates-twitter-ceo-congressional-hearing-dav/). The website also features a section called humor with stories such as this [[VIDEO] What Police Interactions Look Like In BLM’s America](http://conservativematrix.com/video-what-police-interactions-look-like-in-blms-america-dav/). In general, the information reported is mostly factual; however, it is completely one-sided and propagandistic in its support for the right.
