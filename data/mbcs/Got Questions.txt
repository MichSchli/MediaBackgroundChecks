History
[Got Questions](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Got_Questions) is an online fundamentalist Christian ministry that answers questions surrounding Christian doctrines. S. Michael Houdmann founded it in February 2002. The website claims to have over 713,000 questions answered. According to their about page, “Got Questions Ministries seeks to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ by providing biblical, applicable, and timely answers to spiritually related questions through an internet presence. We will do our best to prayerfully and thoroughly research your question and answer it in a biblically-based manner. It is not our purpose to make you agree with us, but rather to point you to what the Bible says concerning your question.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Got Questions denies
[evolution](https://www.gotquestions.org/flaws-theory-evolution.html), promotes [Young Earth Creationism](https://www.gotquestions.org/earth-age.html), and denies [anthropogenic global warming](https://www.gotquestions.org/global-warming.html). The Ministry holds Christian Right views such as [abortion is murder](https://www.gotquestions.org/is-abortion-murder.html) and [condemnation of homosexuality](https://www.gotquestions.org/gay-marriage.html). In summary, this source answers questions based on the Bible, which is not a scientific document and therefore has questionable information that does not align with the current world.
