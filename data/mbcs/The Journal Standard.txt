Analysis / Bias
In review, local news is covered by journalists, and national news through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). There is minimal use of loaded language in headlines and articles such as this: [Fla. pastor sentenced to 100 years in child-sex case](https://www.journalstandard.com/news/20190301/fla-pastor-sentenced-to-100-years-in-child-sex-case). All information is properly sourced.
Editorially, the Journal Standard covers both left and right-leaning viewpoints and never goes to extremes.
