Analysis / Bias
In review, the headlines sometimes contain moderate emotionally loaded language regarding politics, such as
[“Uhuru can be sued for his actions or inactions, court declares](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/nairobi/article/2001397644/uhuru-can-be-sued-while-in-office-high-court-declares).” However, most local news reports do not use emotional language, such as this [Court stops Guaranty Bank from auctioning restauranteur Osewe’s hotel](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001398142/court-stops-bank-from-auctioning-osewes-hotel). World news is republished from [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). When it comes to the sourcing of information, they typically link to themselves or not at all.
Editorially, The Standard reports favorably and with minimal criticism on the right-wing
[Kanu](https://www.jstor.org/stable/484112?seq=1) leader and the owner of Standard Media, Gideon Moi, [“Ruto to back Gideon Moi for the presidency in 2022”](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/politics/article/2001396279/well-back-you-for-top-seat-ruto-tells-gideon) and [“Gideon Moi leads BBI drive in Samburu.”](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/politics/article/2001397789/gideon-moi-leads-bbi-drive-in-samburu-photos) Further, they rarely criticize Right-Wing President Uhuru Kenyatta [SOTN Address: What President Uhuru Kenyatta told Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/politics/article/2001393687/quick-take-what-uhuru-told-kenyans). Finally, when reporting on the opposition, they present with a more negative tone, such as this [NASA principals sideline Raila in strategy to win by-elections](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/politics/article/2001398162/nasa-principals-sideline-raila-in-strategy-to-win-by-elections). A review of op-eds demonstrates a reasonable balance of opinions, but there is rarely criticism of the ruling right-wing Jubilee Party. They generally report the news factually but with poor sourcing and a right-leaning editorial bias that favors the government.
