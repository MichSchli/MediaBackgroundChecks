Funded by / Ownership
The Windsor Star is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his involvement in hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a
[downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Windsor Star reports local and regional news through journalists with minimal loaded words such as this:
[Hospital threatened with libel suit as appeal hearing continues](https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/hospital-threatened-with-libel-suit-as-appeal-hearing-continues). National news is derived primarily from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), whereas world news comes from multiple sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Generally, straight news reporting is factual and presents with minimal biased wording; however, story selection tends to lean right.
Editorially, there is a clear right-leaning bias with commentaries such as this:
[Editorial: Of choices we have, Ford’s PCs are best](https://windsorstar.com/opinion/editorials/pov-our-choice-for-ontario-is-ford/wcm/3695c6dd-6a88-411a-a71f-cd668a05a5c1) and this [Windsor Star’s View: End the subsidies](https://windsorstar.com/opinion/editorials/windsor-stars-view-end-the-subsidies). While the Windsor Star does offer opposing viewpoints, on the whole, more editorials favor the conservative right.
