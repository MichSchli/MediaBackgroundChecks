[the Chinese government](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/), which is well known for enforcing strict censorship on the internet.

In review, Weibo has similar features to American social media sites, particularly Twitter. It also has features similar to Instagram and Facebook, such as uploading short videos that disappear after 24 hrs called “Weibo stories.” Besides those features, they also have a game center Game.Weibo.Com, which provides a variety of online games for users.

This post has been deleted. Please see…” A [ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/) article called “ [China’s Memory Hole](https://projects.propublica.org/weibo/)“ shows how images are censored and erased from Weibo.
In general, like all media in China, Weibo is an arm of the communist government that censors content to promote pro-Chinese propaganda.
