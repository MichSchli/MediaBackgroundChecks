Analysis / Bias
This review is based on website content only. The Ring of Fire disclaims on their about page that “the listed author on each post is solely responsible for his/her content posted to the site. There is not an independent editorial board that reviews the content.”
In review, Ring of Fire publishes news that is strongly left-biased and utilizes frequently emotionally charged loaded words:
[Trump’s Mental Problems Are Getting Worse And He Has To Be Removed](https://trofire.com/2019/04/07/trumps-mental-problems-are-getting-worse-and-he-has-to-be-removed/) and this [Donald Trump Has Cheated His Way Through His Entire Life](https://trofire.com/2019/04/06/donald-trump-has-cheated-his-way-through-his-entire-life/). Both of these stories source from a transcript of dialogue from their radio programs. They also publish links to videos from [The Young Turks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-young-turks/), which we have rated strongly left-biased.
Editorially, all stories favor the progressive left and often criticize centrist Democrats such as this
[VP Kamala Harris Is HUGE Liability For Midterm Democrats](https://trofire.com/2021/08/15/vp-kamala-harris-is-huge-liability-for-midterm-democrats/) and denigrate the right such as this [Oops! McConnell Backtracks And Says He Wants Corporations In Politics](https://trofire.com/2021/04/08/oops-mcconnell-backtracks-and-says-he-wants-corporations-in-politics/). In general, Ring of Fire articles strongly favor the progressive left and are not always sourced properly.
