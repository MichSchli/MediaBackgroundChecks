History
[Founded in 2019](http://whois.domaintools.com/globalrealnews.com) by [Glenn Clinton](https://globalrealnews.com/author/admin/), Global Real News is a website that publishes scientific stories. According to their [about page](https://globalrealnews.com/about-us/) they are “your source for accurate reporting on the latest scientific studies. We are a small team of scientifically-literate adults working in engineering, chemistry, and the pharmaceutical industry who write for this website whenever we see research that we believe is of interest to our readers. Here you’ll find clean, easy-to-read, and factual reporting on the latest scientific studies with no agenda.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Global Real News writes original articles on science and scientific studies, however, it should be noted that they have not published a story since August 10, 2019. Stories typically have captivating titles to interest the reader such as this:
[The Extravagant Courtship Of Wolf Spiders Ends In A Deadly Trap](https://globalrealnews.com/biology/2019/07/25/the-extravagant-courtship-of-wolf-spiders-ends-in-a-deadly-trap/). This story is appropriately sourced to the journal Behavioral Processes. In general, all of the science-related stories are credible.
Interestingly, this website has a hidden tag called “news” in which they take a news story published on Reddit and analyze the comments to determine if they are positive or negative and objective or subjective. The primary author for these analyzed Reddit posts is
[Karen Crowder](https://globalrealnews.com/author/karen/). While the “news” tag is hidden and the articles not openly visible on the website, neither is Karen Crowder listed on the “meet the team” page. In our review of Karen Crowder’s [assessments](https://globalrealnews.com/news/2019/09/09/shocking-facts-support-national-popular-vote/) on what is negative or objective etc, we find that she is generally accurate in her determinations. However, the stories she chooses to analyze typically favor the left, especially when it comes to [climate change action](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), where she disclaims: “As this is a story very close to my heart, we are digging deeper into this development and will update this post as soon as we are done.”
