Analysis / Bias
Law & Liberty publishes essays, news, podcasts, forums, and book reviews from a right-leaning libertarian perspective. Articles and headlines often contain emotional wording to sway the reader, such as this
[Letting Crisis Go to Waste](https://lawliberty.org/letting-crisis-go-to-waste/). While this essay is biased and negatively charged against progressivism, it relies on credible sources such as [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [PNAS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-of-the-united-states-of-america-pnas/), [CDC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), and [Skeptic.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/skeptic-magazine/).
Editorially, they are highly critical of the left and offer criticism of former President Trump when his policy and actions do not align with Libertarian perspectives
[Trump’s Rage, Washington’s Prudence](https://lawliberty.org/how-george-washington-handled-a-mob-and-restored-faith-in-law-and-compromise/). When reporting on science issues such as [Covid-19](https://lawliberty.org/how-the-uk-succeeded-with-vaccines/), they reject government mandates but embrace the science of the disease and vaccines. In another article discussing climate change, they again don’t dispute the science but reject alarmism and strong government intervention [How to Teach Children about Climate Change](https://lawliberty.org/how-to-teach-children-about-climate-change/). In general, they report news factually and with a right-leaning libertarian bias.
