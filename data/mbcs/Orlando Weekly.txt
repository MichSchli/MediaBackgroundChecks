Analysis / Bias
The Orlando Weekly covers local arts, food, culture, music, entertainment, and news for the Orlando Metro Area. Local news is generally reported via staff writers, with some in-depth pieces. Straight news uses minimally loaded words such as this:
[Freeze warning issued for Orlando area on Christmas weekend](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/freeze-warning-issued-for-orlando-area-on-christmas-weekend-33179497). News stories are generally sourced through quotes, first-hand accounts, or hyperlinks.
Editorially, the Orlando Weekly leans strongly left with progressive opinion/news pieces such as these:
[GLAAD’s ‘Back to School’ video shows life under Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/glaads-back-to-school-video-shows-life-under-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-32210710) and [Florida urges appeals court to leave abortion ban in place as lawsuit works through courts](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/news/florida-urges-appeals-court-to-leave-abortion-ban-in-place-as-lawsuit-works-through-courts-32032461). Generally, story selection moderately favors the left, while opinion-oriented pieces use strong emotional wording to denigrate the right. Most information is sourced properly.
