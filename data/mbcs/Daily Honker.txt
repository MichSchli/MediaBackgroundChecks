[Trump Tower](https://dailyhonker.com/bag-of-smoking-feces-left-outside-nyc-trump-tower/), and political commentary, as seen in [Steve Bannon’s CPAC speech,](https://dailyhonker.com/lock-them-up-steve-bannon-puts-illegitimate-biden-regime-on-blast-in-epic-cpac-speech/) suggests a preference for content that can polarize or provoke strong reactions among readers.
