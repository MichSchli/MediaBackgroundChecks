Analysis / Bias
The Last American Vagabond’s reporting aligns with conspiracy theories and questions established scientific and geopolitical narratives. The video
[“Gain-Of-Function’s Newest ‘Brain Virus’ & Genetically Engineered Proteins To Control… Everything](https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/gain-function-engineered-proteins/) and the article “ [Why the US-UK attack on ‘the Houthis’ was an act of war on the Yemeni State](https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/us-uk-attack-houthis-act-of-war/)” exemplify this. Both pieces display significant skepticism toward established narratives, especially concerning COVID-19 vaccines and the portrayal of the Houthi movement in Yemen.
The video, hosted by Ryan Cristián, uses several sources to question vaccine efficacy and safety, appealing to viewers already doubtful of mainstream narratives. This selective presentation risks spreading misinformation. Similarly, the article offers a narrative counter to mainstream media portrayals, presenting the Houthis as a legitimate governing force, challenging Western perspectives. Sources used in both the video and article, such as Igor Chudov’s study analysis, Annals of Internal Medicine & JCM studies, and reports from various news outlets (
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Anadolu Agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anadolu-agency/), and the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)), are interpreted to align with the theme of questioning official narratives and suggesting hidden agendas.
Generally, The Last American Vagabond presents conspiracy theories as factual truths, significantly deviating from mainstream understanding and facts. Consequently, its credibility in providing unbiased and accurate information is questionable.
