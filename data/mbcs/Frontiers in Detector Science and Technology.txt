Analysis / Bias
Frontiers in Detector Science and Technology is an open-access journal that publishes information and research related to Detector Science. The journal primarily publishes research like this:
[Investigating binding energies and trapping cross-sections in an n-type Ge detector at low temperatures](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdest.2023.1275385/full).
[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
However, Frontiers in Detector Science and Technology is a credible scientific journal, as we have not found any controversy or significant retractions. However, Frontiers Media has
[retracted](https://retractionwatch.com/2014/09/26/publisher-issues-statement-of-concern-about-hiv-denial-paper-launches-investigation/) some studies in other publications that were found to be of poor methodology and not thoroughly peer-reviewed.
