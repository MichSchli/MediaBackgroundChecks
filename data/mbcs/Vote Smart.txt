Analysis / Bias
In review, essentially, this website is a search engine to look up politicians’ bios, votes, positions, ratings, speeches, and funding. For example, we searched a random politician, such as
[Ted Budd,](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/171489/ted-budd) a Republican from North Carolina. The website produced accurate results for each category without bias. We tried the Democratic Politician [Cory Booker](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/biography/76151/cory-booker) and received the same accurate results. While the website does not produce original fact checks, they [partner](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/about/bull) with [FactCheck.org,](http://Factcheck.org) [PolitiFact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/), and The [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) to expose the most egregious falsehoods. In general, this is a highly factual website that displays minimal bias.
