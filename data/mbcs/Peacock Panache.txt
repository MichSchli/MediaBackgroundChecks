Analysis / Bias
In review, Peacock Panache consistently publishes news and opinions that strongly favor the left through both story selection and strongly loaded emotional wording such as these:

While these stories are both strongly left biased in content, the information contained in the articles is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [Esquire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/esquire-magazine/), and [Newsweek](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/).
