History
[Founded in 2011](http://whois.domaintools.com/worldtruth.tv), World Truth TV is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website. According to their [about page](https://worldtruth.tv/aboutus/), the blog’s purpose is to serve “sacred knowledge” that the author has discovered. The primary author appears to be someone named Eddie, but there is a lack of transparency, so the editor and owner’s name is unknown.

Funded by / Ownership
The website is presumably owned by “Eddie,” and revenue is derived through advertising and donations.
