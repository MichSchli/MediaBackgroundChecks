Analysis / Bias
In review, The Mary Sue offers news and opinions of geek culture from a female perspective. Topics covered are gaming, technology, entertainment, and politics. When covering politics, there is a strong left-leaning bias in story selection and wording such as this:
[Twitter Creates Epic Ivanka Trump Memes After Her Embarrassing Attempt to Interact with World Leaders](https://www.themarysue.com/unwantedivanka-memes/), and this [Donald Trump Is Planning the Worst Fourth of July Party](https://www.themarysue.com/trump-fourth-of-july-campaign-rally/). This latter story is appropriately sourced from left-leaning sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Huff Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/), and [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/).
Editorially, many articles offer a pro-feminist perspective such as this:
[We’re Here for Two Teenagers Who Started a Feminist Club at Their All-Male School](https://www.themarysue.com/two-teenagers-feminist-club-all-male-school/). In general, story selection and political advocacy align with the left.
