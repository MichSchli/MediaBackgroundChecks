Analysis / Bias
In review, the Clarinda Herald-Journal reports on news, sports, weather, crime, and entertainment for the greater Clarinda region. Reporters demonstrate minimal bias when reporting local news, such as this
[Page County secures election information](https://clarindaherald.com/news/local/page-county-secures-election-information/article_bb7a8e4e-5770-11ec-bb36-47f8216d4101.html). Further, the website publishes national and international news from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Finally, all information is sourced via first-person accounts or through credible media.
Editorially, the Clarinda Herald-Journal reasonably represents both sides. A review of editorial articles demonstrates a reasonable low bias; however, slightly more op-eds favor the right such as this
[John M. Crisp: Kyle Rittenhouse is also a victim](https://clarindaherald.com/opinion/columnists/john-m-crisp-kyle-rittenhouse-is-also-a-victim/article_efc7261f-de00-5801-a0e3-078308f93f6a.html). While more op-eds favor the right, liberal perspectives have fair representation; therefore, they earn a least biased rating on the right side of the scale. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
