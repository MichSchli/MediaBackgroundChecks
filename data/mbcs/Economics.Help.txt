Analysis / Bias
Economics.Help uses minimal loaded words in their articles and usually sources properly to mostly left-leaning economists and economic news. In many
[blog posts](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/27917/concepts/gravity-theory-economics/), left-leaning economist Paul Krugman is cited. In general, Economics.Help articles regarding the USA economy tend to favor left-leaning economic policies: [“US economy under Obama 2009-2017”](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/25420/economics/us-economy-under-obama-2009-2017/).
