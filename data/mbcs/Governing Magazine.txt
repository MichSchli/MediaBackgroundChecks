Analysis / Bias
In review, the Governing website publishes news in the primary categories Security, Finance, Work, Context, and Community design. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded emotional language, such as this
[County Rejects Ransom Demand. Hackers Expose Sensitive Data](https://www.governing.com/security/County-Rejects-Ransom-Demand-Hackers-Expose-Sensitive-Data.html). This story is published through the [Herald-Sun.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-herald-sun-durham-north-carolina/) For the most part, articles are republished from credible local newspapers, such as this from the [Boston Herald](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-herald/) [Massachusetts’ New Police Reform Law Misses First Deadline](https://www.governing.com/now/Massachusetts-New-Police-Reform-Law-Misses-First-Deadline.html). Original reporting is often well-sourced and factual such as this [Our Cities Get Zoning All Wrong. Here’s a Way to Do It Better](https://www.governing.com/community/Our-Cities-Get-Zoning-All-Wrong-Heres-a-Way-to-Do-It-Better.html).
Editorially, Governing tends to favor the left with positive news stories on
[President Joe Biden](https://www.governing.com/next/Biden-Administration-Expected-to-Aid-FinTech-Innovation.html) and a more negative tone toward former [President Trump](https://www.governing.com/now/How-Governors-Not-Congress-Emerged-as-Trumps-Main-Opposition.html). In general, the news is reported factually and with a left-leaning bias in story selection.
