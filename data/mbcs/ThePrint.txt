Analysis / Bias
ThePrint covers a mix of political, social, and economic news stories, addressing various aspects of Indian society. ThePrint often uses neutral language and avoids sensationalism in its headlines and articles such as this:
[Yet another Houthi missile strike on merchant vessel with Indian crew, Navy responds to SOS call.](https://theprint.in/defence/indian-navy-responds-to-sos-call-from-vessel-struck-by-houthi-missile-in-gulf-of-aden/1941897/) This story, like others reviewed, was properly sourced from credible outlets; however, there is a lack of hyperlinks in most articles.
Editorially, ThePrint routinely favors the ruling right-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Modi. For example, in this article,
[Bharat Ratna is a political tool Modi using it to position BJP as a social justice party](https://theprint.in/opinion/bharat-ratna-is-a-political-tool-modi-using-it-to-position-bjp-as-a-social-justice-party/1938660/) and this [Modi has defined new ‘political time’ at Ayodhya. It’ll reshape our future public culture,](https://theprint.in/opinion/modi-has-defined-new-political-time-at-ayodhya-itll-reshape-our-future-public-culture/1935238/) both report favorably on the BJP. In general, the website holds right leaning biases and is reasonably factual due to poor sourcing techniques.
