Analysis / Bias
Most of Actualized.org’s articles focus on personal development and self-help; however, some have criticized the website for promoting pseudoscientific ideas. Leo Gura is the founder and administrator of Actualized.org, which includes a forum. In his
[forum](https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23371-brainwave-frequency-most-associated-with-meditation/), Leo Gura discusses Alpha and theta brainwave frequencies for meditation
“You have to train your mind to sync the peaks of alpha and theta, which requires an EEG machine, which is too complicated to go into here. Theta beats are good for purifying trauma and shadow work.”
The scientific community generally does not accept some of Leo Gura’s claims about the brain and neuroscience. Some may even be considered pseudoscientific or misleading. For example, he has promoted using
[psychedelic drugs](https://www.inverse.com/input/culture/leo-gura-actualized-org-youtube-forum-death-suicide) to promote enlightenment. While studies have shown that Psychedelic drugs may have [therapeutic benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603818/), they must be prescribed by a licensed Doctor in a clinical setting.
While Leo Gura’s website mainly emphasizes self-help, he also has YouTube videos presenting himself as non-partisan and critiquing the political left. For example, he discusses his beliefs about the political left in a video titled “
[When Does The Left Go Too Far?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAKThCSh5Hs) In another video, he criticizes the political right, [“Understanding The Liberal Mind.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UJbHNhYl0U&t=1298s)
In general, Actualized.org is a
[pseudoscience](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Leo_Gura) website that advocates questionable methods for self-help and encourages psychedelic drug use.
