We want to show that there is a different view. In particular, Iran and the Shi’as have become a focal point of world propaganda. From the media point of view, we are trying to give a second eye to Western audiences.”

Analysis / Bias
According to Reporters Without Borders, Iran is ranked 170 out of 180 countries for press freedom. They
[report](https://rsf.org/en/iran), “Iran has been one of the world’s most repressive countries for journalists for the past 40 years. State control of news and information is unrelenting, and at least 860 journalists and citizen journalists have been imprisoned or executed since 1979.”
In review, Press TV is an Iranian propaganda TV network and website. Several credible media outlets have criticized Press TV, such as The
[Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), who [described](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/dec/02/press-tv-full-story-asa) Press TV as “the controversial 24-hour news channel funded by the Iranian government.” British journalist [Nick Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cohen) has called the station “a platform for the full fascist conspiracy theory of supernatural Jewish power.” The right-leaning [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/) has [described](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/from-press-tv-four-examples-of-iranian-propaganda) them this way “If you like crackpot conspiracy theories or you’re interested in what the Iranian government wants you to believe, then pay a visit to Press TV!”
A news article review demonstrates a mixture of true unbiased news reporting such as this
[Democratic candidates may boycott debate due to strike](https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/12/14/613679/Sixth-Democratic-Presidential-Debate-Las-Vegas). In contrast, others are overt conspiracy theories negative toward the west such as this: [Trump is completely controlled by criminal Zionists: Writer](https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/12/14/613686/%E2%80%98Trump-completely-controlled-by-criminal-Zionists%E2%80%99). This article is not sourced and makes debunked 9/11 conspiracy claims such as this “Evidence has proven that the 9/11 attacks were planned, carried out, and covered up by neocon factions in the US government with heavy Israeli impetus. Yet the official narrative still implicates 19 fictional hijackers, of which 15 were said to be Saudi nationals.” In general, if it involves the USA or Israel, you can bank on it being negative and most likely misleading and/or false.
