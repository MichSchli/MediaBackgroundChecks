History
[Founded in 1845](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Citizen), The Ottawa Citizen is an English-language daily broadsheet newspaper owned by Postmedia Network in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The Ottawa Citizen has changed ownership many times over the years, and with each change, there was a new direction in editorial bias. The current editor is Michelle Richardson.

Funded by / Ownership
The Ottawa Citizen is owned by
[PostMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmedia_Network), which owns several right-leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left-leaning [CanadaLand](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/canadaland/), PostMedia has [directed](https://www.canadalandshow.com/the-conservative-transformation-of-postmedia/) its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees. [Chatham Asset Management,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/behind-trump-s-tabloid-king-a-connected-and-flush-hedge-fund) a New Jersey-based hedge fund, holds a significant equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc., which owns the [National Enquirer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-enquirer/). [David Pecker](https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html), who owns American Media, Inc., joined the Postmedia board and then [resigned ](https://www.canadalandshow.com/postmedia-david-pecker-donald-trump/)from the board of Postmedia in 2018 due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends,” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a
[downward spiral](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/10/25/analysis/postmedia-continues-its-downward-spiral). After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey [stepped down](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey will remain as executive chair. [Godfrey](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/01/10/paul-godfrey-steps-down-as-postmedia-ceo-andrew-macleod-set-to-take-over.html) was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016 while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Ottawa Citizen covers local news via journalists and national news via
[The Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) and International news through various sources such as [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/) for business news, [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [The Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/). All information is properly sourced to credible media outlets.
Editorially, there are
[more negative articles](https://ottawacitizen.com/?s=trudeau) regarding liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau than positive. While the Ottawa Citizen does criticize former President Trump, they do so lightly. In general, more stories favor the right editorially than the left, but there is a reasonable balance.
