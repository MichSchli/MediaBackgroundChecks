Analysis / Bias
In review, Grabien News breaks its information into three categories: Clips, Lists, and News. Clips present video clips from various news sources such as
[MSNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/), [C-Span](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/c-span/), and [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/). Lists break the news into topic categories that heavily lean right and negatively toward the left. Some lists include: [A Complete Guide to the Scandals of the Obama Administration](https://lists.grabien.com/list-complete-guide-scandals-obama-administration) or [44 Obama Era EPA Scandals the Media Ignored](https://lists.grabien.com/list-epa-scandals-under-obama-administration).
Speaking of climate change, Grabien presents a skeptical view that is not aligned with the
[consensus of the science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), as evidenced by this list, [Articles Supporting a Skeptical View of Global Warming](https://lists.grabien.com/list-articles-supporting-skeptical-view-global-warming). The sourcing for Lists ranges from the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) to far-right conspiracy and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), [CNS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/), and [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/).
The News page aggregates news from a variety of sources that range from Left-Center to far-right questionable, such as Breitbart. A thorough review of sources used on the news page shows a disproportionate amount from the right as compared to the left. Generally, Grabien republishes news that favors the right through story selection and sourcing.
Failed Fact Checks
[On Nov. 9, 2020, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it was “bad news” that Pfizer had developed what appeared to be a successful COVID-19 vaccine, during U.S. President Donald Trump’s tenure.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cuomo-vaccine-bad-news-trump/)– Mostly False
- Grabien sometimes relies on sources that fail fact-checks.
