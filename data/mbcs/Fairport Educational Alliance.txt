History
According to their
[About Us](https://fairporteducationalalliance.org/about-us) page, Fairport Educational Alliance was established because they believe education should be based on scholarship and facts. They express concern over introducing new curriculums that they describe as “toxic” and divisive, particularly those that align with New York State’s Culturally Responsive-Sustaining Framework.
While the page does address what the organization aims to do and why they feel compelled to do it, it lacks information on how they plan to achieve their goals. The website does not provide information about its founder, owner, or key persons involved. The organization appears to be focused on issues in New York.

Analysis / Bias
The Fairport Educational Alliance website exhibits a conservative bias. It opposes educational frameworks focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion, arguing that these approaches contradict “traditional family structures” and “basic American values.” However, the website does not explicitly define these terms, leaving them open to interpretation and potentially excluding various family configurations.
The site features articles that use emotionally loaded language to emphasize frustration and concern. For example, the article
[“It’s Time to Take Back Our Schools: Mom’s Eye-Opening Experience”](https://fairporteducationalalliance.org/news/f/its-time-to-take-back-our-schools-moms-eye-opening-experience?blogcategory=Sex+Ed) is written by an anonymous parent, raising questions about the experiences’ verifiability. The article includes phrases like “I’m at my wits’ end” and “sick and tired of this nonsense.” Another article, [“What is Gender Theory?”](https://fairporteducationalalliance.org/what-is-gender-theory%3F) discusses gender theory. The page also includes videos discussing gender and sexual identity in schools, including a video by Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator. These videos contribute to the overall conservative stance of the page on issues related to gender theory. Further, [Ben Shapiro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ben-shapiro-bias-rating/) is a political commentator and not a subject matter expert in gender studies or related fields.
Additionally, the “News” section mainly provides links to other organizations like “
[Moms for Liberty,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/moms-for-liberty-bias/)“ [“Parents Defending Education,”](https://defendinged.org/) [“No Left Turn in Education,”](https://noleftturn.us/) and [“Parents Against Critical Theory”](https://parentsagainstcriticaltheory.com/). In general, the Fairport Educational Alliance holds far-right-leaning political biases and sometimes relies on sources that [promote misinformation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/06/06/splc-moms-for-liberty-anti-government-extremist-group/70289379007/) on Critical Race Theory and the LGBTQ community.
