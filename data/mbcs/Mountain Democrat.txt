Analysis / Bias
In review, The Mountain Democrat primarily reports local and regional news with little reporting of national news. News reporting is done with minimal loaded words and is generally low biased and direct such as this
[EDC learns of 3 more COVID-19 deaths Thursday](https://www.mtdemocrat.com/news/edc-learns-of-3-more-covid-19-deaths-thursday/). Since this is primarily local news it is generally reported through quotes vs. links.
Editorially, Op-eds tend to lean right such as this
[California Commentary: Case for a Newsom recall continues to grow](https://www.mtdemocrat.com/opinion/california-commentary-case-for-a-newsom-recall-continues-to-grow/) and [The Balancing Act: Some thoughts on those who stormed the Capitol?](https://www.mtdemocrat.com/opinion/the-balancing-act-who-stormed-the-capitol/) While both sides are represented, more tend to slightly favor the right. In general, the news is reported factually and with a slight right-leaning editorial bias.
