Analysis / Bias
Coreysdigs.com is an alternative media platform known for promoting conspiracy theories. A notable theory presented on the site with the title “
[FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN, U.S. Funding the Control Grid Part 3: The Food Framework,](https://www.coreysdigs.com/food-supply-chain/funding-the-control-grid-part-3-the-food-framework/) is the alleged global conspiracy to control food and water supplies, implicating figures like Henry Kissinger and Klaus Schwab of the [World Economic Forum](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/). This theory suggests that these figures are part of a larger scheme to establish control over the global population.
The site cites sources like
[Robert W. Malone’s Malone Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/malone-institute-bias/), which is associated with vaccine skepticism. The Malone Institute suggests that graduates of the World Economic Forum are strategically positioned to support a globalist agenda, furthering the conspiracy narrative.
The author on Coreysdigs.com encourages readers to question the motives and actions of these individuals and the World Economic Forum. This call for skepticism is part of the site’s broader approach to challenging mainstream narratives. A quote from the article reads, “Schwab’s World Economic Forum has planted Young Global Leaders throughout the world to carry out a continuum of Kissinger’s depopulation plan, in part by controlling and transforming the food supply.”
However, the content on Coreysdigs.com often includes misleading information and selectively chosen evidence to support its narratives. It frequently uses sources with a history of promoting conspiracy theories, such as
[Unlimited Hangout](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/unlimited-hangout-bias/), [The Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), [ Vaccine Skeptic Robert W. Malone’s maloneinstitute.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/malone-institute-bias/), and [The Defender (Children’s Health Defense).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-defender-childrens-health-defense-credibility/)
Another article titled
[“Shipwrecked on Ten Islands with Clintons & Branson.”](https://www.coreysdigs.com/clinton-foundation/shipwrecked-on-ten-islands-with-clintons-branson/) presents an investigative report on the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean. The author suggests that the Clintons and Richard Branson have ulterior motives behind their regional philanthropic projects. The Clintons are often subjects of numerous internet conspiracy theories, including Pizzagate, the “Clinton Body Count,” the Benghazi Attack, and the Uranium One Deal. However, these theories lack credible evidence and have been debunked by multiple investigations and fact-checking organizations. Despite offering alternative viewpoints, Coreysdigs.com’s credibility and factual reporting are questionable due to its reliance on misinformation and speculative sources.
