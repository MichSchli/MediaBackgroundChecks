History
Launched in 2000,
[Al Manar](https://english.almanar.com.lb/about) is the official website for the TV station Al Manar. Al Manar features Lebanese, world, and business news, with a section called “Focus on Zionists” and a section for Hezbollah Statements.

Funded by / Ownership
[Al Manar](https://lebanon.mom-rsf.org/en/media/detail/outlet/al-manar/) is fully affiliated with Hezbollah and calls itself “the main tool in keeping up with the victories of the Lebanese Resistance of Hezbollah and the Zionist entity’s crimes.” The US state department designates Al Manar as a [media arm](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js4134.aspx) of Hezbollah. The [Lebanese Communication Group](https://lebanon.mom-rsf.org/en/owners/companies/detail/company//%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%84/) operates Al Manar TV and is owned by Hezbollah. Funding and revenue are not transparent.
Analysis / Bias
According to a
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) profile on [Lebanon’s Media](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14648683), “Almost all TVs and radios are privately-owned, and many are affiliated with political groups. Al-Manar TV is operated by the militant group Hezbollah.
In review, Al Manar publishes articles with strong emotionally loaded language such as “
[Lebanon Shows Entire World Pride in Face of US Tyrant.”](https://english.almanar.com.lb/702044) The article reads, “Pompeo and his entourage started touring the various decision-making centers in Beirut to provoke the Lebanese against Hezbollah resistance which has protected the country from the Zionist and the takfiri enemies.” Al Manar reports selectively when the issue doesn’t resonate with Hezbollah. When it comes to sourcing, Al Manar often hyperlinks to itself, and typically when covering world news, they republish news from [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) such as [“China to Impose Sanctions on US Firms in Taiwan Arms Sale](https://english.almanar.com.lb/780441).”
Editorially, Al Manar is classified as a hate group by the
[ADL](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) where they [state](https://www.adl.org/blog/hezbollah-re-launches-apps-blames-adl-for-failure-of-previous-effort) “Al-Manar broadcasts the terrorist group’s messages of hate and violence, disseminates anti-Semitic and anti-American propaganda and glorifies suicide bombings to millions of viewers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”
