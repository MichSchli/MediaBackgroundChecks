History
[Founded in 1995](https://whois.domaintools.com/mediacircus.com), Media Circus is a far-right blog that has promoted misinformation. The website lacks transparency as no one is named as editor or owner. The domain is registered in New Zealand, but that does not confirm this source comes from there.
Funded by / Ownership
Media Circus does not disclose ownership. The website does not have a clear source of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Media Circus is a questionable source with a far-right bias in reporting. All articles reviewed were pro-right and anti-left. Media Circus does not have an about page or disclaimer to describe who and what they are. The content of headlines and articles use loaded words and quote sources that are right biased or on our questionable list. For example, this headline uses the loaded word “Tragic”
[“The tragic family background of Barack Obama .“](https://www.mediacircus.com/tag/communism/) The use of the word “tragic” in this case is meant to portray Obama negatively. In another article entitled: [Soros-Funded ‘Fact Check’ Group Will Determine Which Facebook Stories are “Fake News,”](https://www.mediacircus.com/2016/12/soros-funded-fact-check-group-will-determine-which-facebook-stories-are-fake-news/) they source to the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which is on MBFC’s questionable list due to publishing many false stories. Further, the claim that Soros is funding Snopes is [false](http://www.snopes.com/ownership-and-revenue/).
Overall, due to poor sourcing, a false claim, and misleading words, we rate Media Circus as mixed for factual reporting with a strong right-wing bias. (M. Huitsing 7/26/2017) Updated (7/7/2021)
