Analysis / Bias
In 2022
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Slovenia 54/180 in their Press [Freedom Index.](https://rsf.org/en/slovenia) The current prime minister of Slovenia is [Janez Janša](https://apnews.com/f128a2a9413d24cd2f550f8ea129face); he is also the nationalist, right-wing populist Slovenian Democratic Party (SDP) leader. Janez Janša is known to use social media to attack critics such as Slovenian public broadcaster [Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTVS)](https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/detail-alert?p_p_id=sojdashboard_WAR_coesojportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-3&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=11&_sojdashboard_WAR_coesojportlet_alertPK=62377374&_sojdashboard_WAR_coesojportlet_displayLink=SojPortlet.getDashboardPortletId%28%29) and call critical journalists [“Presstitutes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/janez-jansa-new-pm-slovenia-in-mould-of-orban).”
In review, 24ur.com predominantly delivers infotainment content such as heavily image-focused news articles. The headlines are catchy with a primarily neutral tone when covering national news, such as
[“What do Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs expect after the corona crisis?”](https://www.24ur.com/novice/korona/kaj-po-korona-krizi-pricakujejo-slovenci-hrvati-in-srbi.html) and [“Melania Trump is celebrating her 50th birthday: from Sevnica to the White House”.](https://www.24ur.com/popin/tuja-scena/melania-trump-praznuje-50-rojstni-dan-od-sevnice-do-bele-hise.html) They also use minimally loaded language such as this: “ [Janez Janša will be the Slovenian Prime Minister for the third time: 52 deputies voted in favor](https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/jansa-8.html)” and [Twitter dispute between Janša and Šarc: ‘If they don’t believe me, they will at least be a medium in the service of the truth.’](https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/jansa-sarec.html) When it comes to sourcing, they rarely use hyperlinks but offer quotations. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a neutral tone such as this [Trump denies involvement in an attempted coup in Venezuela](https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/trump-zavraca-vpletenost-v-poskus-vdora-v-venezuelo.html).
Editorially, 24ur.com does not present opinion pieces; however, they generally present news with balance when reporting on politics. In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
