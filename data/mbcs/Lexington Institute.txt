Analysis / Bias
In review, the Lexington Institute’s website provides news in the categories of Defense, Energy, Education, Logistics, and In The News. News and research are original and generally low biased such as this
[The U.S. Department Of Energy’s Office Of Electricity: A Discussion With Bruce Walker, Assistant Secretary](https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/the-u-s-department-of-energys-office-of-electricity-a-discussion-with-bruce-walker-assistant-secretary/). This story is properly sourced. Most stories, however, are summaries and links to other publications in which a Lexington Institute member was published. The most common sources they are published in are the right-leaning [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/), InsideSources, and [RealClearDefense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-clear-defense/). They are also published in the [Boston Globe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-globe/) and [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/).
Editorially, they align moderately with the right, emphasizing a strong national defense, education reform, and market-driven solutions to energy and logistic needs. Although they generally support conservative policy, they do not always report favorably on former President Trump, such as this
[Britain’s Trump Fails Again](https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/britains-trump-fails-again/).
Regarding science, the Lexington Institute supports the consensus that
[Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is human-influenced; however, they support free-market solutions rather than the government. They generally report news factually with a right-leaning editorial and policy bias.
