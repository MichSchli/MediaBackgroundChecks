Analysis / Bias
In our previous review, we rated The Hearty Soul as a strong pseudoscience website based on promoting homeopathic cancer cures and relying on discredited sources such as
[Joseph Mercola,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/) who is also on our pseudoscience list for the promotion of unproven homeopathic remedies and [anti-vaccination conspiracies](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). They also published articles about the existence of human souls and ghosts, which have not been proven to exist. There are some valid articles on this website.
Since our last review, they removed most of the questionable content and generally publish fact-based content. However, we still find the publication of mild pseudoscience articles such as this
[Eat Brussel Sprouts Regularly, Your Body Will Thank You](https://theheartysoul.com/brussel-sprouts/). In this article, they claim that Brussel Sprouts can prevent certain types of cancers. According to the [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/brussels-sprouts/) “There is no direct evidence that Brussels sprouts have anti-cancer effects in humans, and some evidence has suggested that they may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.”
In general, The Hearty Soul has improved their journalistic standards, but there is still misleading pseudoscientific content, as evidenced above. However, the improvements are dramatic since the last review.
