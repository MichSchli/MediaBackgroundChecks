Analysis / Bias
The political articles on The Messenger often focus on topics that align with conservative viewpoints and are presented in a way that suggests a right-leaning bias. For instance, an article titled
[“Biden as VP Apparently Used Pseudonym to Discuss White House Hire with Hunter Biden, Email Shows”](https://themessenger.com/politics/biden-as-vp-apparently-used-pseudonym-to-discuss-white-house-hire-with-hunter-biden-email-shows-report) focuses on an email exchange between Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, from 2014. The author claims that Joe Biden used a pseudonym, “Robin Ware,” to discuss a potential White House hire. The source of this information is said to be Hunter Biden’s laptop. The article uses emotionally loaded language in its title and relies on [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/), which has a known conservative bias, and a PDF document labeled “ [EXHIBIT 4. JUNE 24, 2022, SECOND AOD EMAIL](https://www.slfliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2023/08/20230828-Complaint-Exhibit-4-Doc.-1-4.pdf),” which appears to be a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The article lacks comprehensive context, and its framing suggests a potential bias against the Bidens, with a focus on alleged secretive communications.
Another article,
[“Forty Years Ago, Scientists Warned About Climate Change. How Accurate Were Their Predictions?”](https://themessenger.com/tech/forty-years-ago-scientists-warned-about-climate-change-how-accurate-were-their-predictions) is well-researched and provides a balanced perspective. It cites scientific data and offers a balanced view without pushing a particular agenda. It cites sources like [Gizmodo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/gizmodo/), [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), and co2.earth
A third article,
[“Tucker Carlson: Fox News is ‘Run by Fearful Women,'”](https://themessenger.com/politics/tucker-carlson-fox-news-is-run-by-fearful-women) employs emotionally loaded language like “run by fearful women” and “Ousted Fox News host.” The article offers a one-sided view, focusing solely on [Tucker Carlson’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) perspective without providing counter-arguments or statements from Fox News. The Messenger includes tabloid-style stories alongside political news, such as [Miranda Kerr Is Pregnant With Her Fourth Baby Boy](https://themessenger.com/entertainment/miranda-kerr-pregnant-fourth-baby-boy?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=latest_news).
In general, The Messenger has a right-leaning editorial bias and demonstrates medium credibility based on some articles that use sensational language and questionable sources that lack a balanced perspective.
