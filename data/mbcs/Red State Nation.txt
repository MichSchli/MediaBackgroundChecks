Analysis / Bias
Red State Nation does not produce original reporting but rather summarizes and adds conservative commentary to news from other sources. Articles and headlines often contain emotional language, such as this

Regarding sourcing, most articles do not contain hyperlinked sourcing, instead linking to social media and videos.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left, such as this
