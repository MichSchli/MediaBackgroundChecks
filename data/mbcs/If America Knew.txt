History
If Americans Knew (IAK) features news and reports exclusively regarding the current situation in Israeli-occupied Palestine. Founded by
[Alison Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Weir_(activist)), who is also President of the [Council for the National Interest](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-for-the-national-interest/), IAK’s goal is, as stated on the site: “The mission of If Americans Knew is to inform and educate the American public on issues of major significance that are unreported, underreported, or misreported in the American media.”
If Americans Knew has been criticized by the
[Anti-Defamation League (ADL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) for what they deemed anti-Semitic statements, which [Alison Weir characterizes](http://alisonweir.org/journal/2009/2/13/anti-defamation-league-defames-me-my-letter-to-the-adl.html) as defamation. On the other hand, [Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fairness-accuracy-in-reporting-fair/) has called If Americans Knew “ [Valuable](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215202806/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=22&media_view_id=5437).” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
IAK, in line with its stated goals, provides comprehensive information not only on the history of the conflict but also on the daily affairs of the region. While there is a decidedly pro-Palestine slant to IAK, it appears to be mostly inherent in the content itself, as the articles and information provided are factual, as evidenced by a
[clean fact check record](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=if%20americans%20knew&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking), well-sourced, and presented with a minimum of editorializing. Despite the pro-Palestinian slant and the lack of reporting from Israel’s point of view, the factual content provided earns If Americans Knew a Left-Center rating.
