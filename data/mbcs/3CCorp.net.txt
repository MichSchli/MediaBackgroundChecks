History
[Founded in 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/3ccorp.net), 3CCorp.net is a hyper-partisan news and opinion website that advocates for the Presidency of Donald Trump. The website completely lacks transparency as they do not disclose names associated with ownership or authorship and there is not an about page to describe their mission. However, at the bottom of many articles there is a solicitation for money with the following statement: “I have been working diligently on this website to support our president and put out a conservative message for 14 months now.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

[Hysterical Global Reaction By World Governments To Coronavirus Pandemic ushering in new world order?](https://www.3ccorp.net/2020/03/22/hysterical-global-reaction-by-world-governments-to-coronavirus-pandemic-looks-exactly-like-what-conspiracy-theorists-have-predicted-for-years-now/) This story is sourced to the tin foil hat conspiracy website [Now the End Begins](https://www.3ccorp.net/2020/03/22/hysterical-global-reaction-by-world-governments-to-coronavirus-pandemic-looks-exactly-like-what-conspiracy-theorists-have-predicted-for-years-now/). Story selection is 100% one sided in favor of conservatives and President Donald Trump. The complete lack of balance equates to conservative propaganda. Further, the site frequently utilizes conspiracy and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), [Red State](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-state/) and [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). Finally, the website features conspiracy categories such as “ [The Globalist Agenda](https://www.3ccorp.net/the-globalist-agenda/)” and “ [Soros Watch](https://www.3ccorp.net/soros-watch/)“. In general, 3CCorp.net is a hyper-partisan conservative propaganda and conspiracy source that sometimes makes false claims.
