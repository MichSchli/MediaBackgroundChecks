Analysis / Bias
In review, Foreign Policy News utilizes some credible sources such as
[Merco Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercopress/); however, some articles are [not sourced](http://foreignpolicynews.org/2017/12/30/us-russia-cooperation-syria/) at all. Although the articles are very well written, typically, they fail to source or provide any links to outside sources that can verify their claims.
When it comes to US politics, they utilize emotionally loaded words such as
[“2018 US foreign policy: expect continuance of cataract vision”](http://foreignpolicynews.org/2017/12/31/2018-us-foreign-policy-expect-continuance-cataract-vision/) and “ [Donald Trump’s Jerusalem move scuttles Middle East Peace Process](http://foreignpolicynews.org/2017/12/18/donald-trumps-jerusalem-move-scuttles-middle-east-peace-process/).” A quote from this same article contains significantly loaded words that bias the reader against Trump’s decision: “in conclusion, Trump’s apparently impulsive decisions close the doors of negotiations and diplomacy and open the floodgates to hell.”
