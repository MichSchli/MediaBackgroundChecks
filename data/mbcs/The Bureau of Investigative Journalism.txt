Analysis / Bias
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism conducts investigative journalism, as the name implies. The Bureau works with publishers and broadcasters to maximize the impact of its investigations. For example, they have collaborated with Left and Right-leaning newsrooms such as the
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/2021/03/05/daily-source-bias-check-roanoke-times/), and [The Daily Telegraph](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/). TBIJ has reported on Drone Wars, Death through antibiotic resistance, the hidden influence of lobbying, and more. Story selection covers a wide range of topics and sometimes uses moderate loaded language such as this [Deliveroo riders can earn as little as £2 an hour during shifts, as boss stands to make £500m](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-03-25/deliveroo-riders-earning-as-little-as-2-pounds).
Editorially, stories and investigations tend to favor the left, focusing on inequality, environmentalism, and anti-war positions. Stories such as
[Trump, Obama, and the future of targeted killing](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-19/trump-obama-and-the-future-of-targeted-killing) point out that even though political parties may change, the outcome when it comes to war and aggression is the same. In general, TBIJ reports news factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
