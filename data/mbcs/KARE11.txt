Analysis / Bias
In review, KARE11 reports local news primarily through TV news videos and accompanying text. Local news is presented with minimally loaded wording such as this
[Walz calls for public safety funding ahead of MPD officer trials.](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/walz-calls-for-public-safety-funding-ahead-of-mpd-officer-trials-republicans-to-voice-concerns/89-79ed7849-2592-4163-8107-3f57fa31d339) National and International news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other TEGNA TV stations.
KARE11 also has a section dedicated to politics covering national politics through the Associated Press and local Minnesota politics through KARE11.com. Again, the wording is low-biased such as this:
[Lawmakers seek paid leave for packing plant workers](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/politics/lawmakers-seek-paid-leave-for-packing-plant-workers/89-2da35a57-f0ea-46cd-a4da-14b619375ba7). Further, the website does not publish editorial commentary. Finally, the website features fact checks from TEGNA’s fact check service [VERIFY Fact check.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/verify-fact-check-bias/) In general, the news is reported factually and with minimal bias.
