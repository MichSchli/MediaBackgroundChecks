History
[Founded in 2013](https://whois.domaintools.com/nworeport.me) (domain), NWO Report is a news, and opinion source focused on the New World Order conspiracy theory. According to its [about page](https://nworeport.me/aboutus-update/), “Once dismissed by cynics as a “conspiracy theory, the New World Order is rapidly becoming a reality. We look at its origins, how it operates and how it affects the lives of everyone.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The NWO Report mostly summarizes news stories from other sources focused on far-right conspiracy theories. NWO Report summarizes stories from discredited sources such as the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Project Veritas](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/project-veritas/).
Articles and headlines are highly emotional, favoring conservative conspiracy theories like this

Since 2020, NWO Report has consistently promoted debunked conspiracy theories regarding election fraud in the 2020 election with a section dedicated to the
[“Stolen Election.”](https://nworeport.me/category/stolen-election/) There was [no evidence of systematic election fraud](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) in the 2020 election that would have changed the outcome. Finally, most stories currently focus on the false [“Died Suddenly”](https://nworeport.me/category/covid-vaccine-deaths/) narrative due to the Covid-19 vaccine. [There is no evidence to suggest that vaccines are causing a rise in mortality.](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/the-film-died-suddenly-rehashes-debunked-claims-conspiracy-theories-covid-19-vaccines/) In general, NWO Report is an extreme right-biased conspiracy and pseudoscience website that is rarely factual.
