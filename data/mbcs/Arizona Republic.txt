Analysis / Bias
In review, the Arizona Republic covers local and state news through journalists with minimal bias in story selection and wording:
[New law would make Arizona cities pay for raising the minimum wage](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2019/08/19/arizona-legislature-house-bill-2756-minimum-wage-flagstaff/2014359001/). National news links directly to [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/). In general, straight news reporting is low-biased and factual.
Editorially, the Arizona Republic has a long history of supporting Republican candidates. In fact,
[over the course of 120 years](https://www.azcentral.com/picture-gallery/opinion/editorial/2016/09/07/arizona-republic-presidential-endorsements-120-years-no-democrats/89982938/), they never endorsed a Democratic presidential candidate until 2016, when they [endorsed](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/09/27/hillary-clinton-endorsement/91198668/) Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. [Further](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic#cite_note-McCain_Endorement-5), “In local elections, they have recently endorsed Democratic candidates such as former Arizona Governor, former Secretary of Homeland Security, and now President of the University of California [Janet Napolitano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano) and former Arizona Congressman [Harry Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Mitchell).”
Next, a review of their Op-Ed page also demonstrates a left-leaning bias with articles such as this:
[Jeff Flake says he will not call Donald Trump a racist. He should.](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2019/08/16/jeff-flake-says-donald-trump-not-racist-hes-wrong/2032861001/) Lastly, we reviewed the editorials and found a reasonable balance, with 6 out of 10 favoring the left.
