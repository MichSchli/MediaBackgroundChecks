History
[EUvsDisinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/about/) is the flagship project of the East StratCom Task Force (ESCTF), established in 2015 by the European External Action Service to counter Russian disinformation. The task force, funded by the EU since 2018, focuses on identifying, analyzing, and raising awareness about disinformation in various forms. It covers topics such as [Russian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/) information manipulation campaigns related to [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/).
EUvsDisinfo is based in Brussels, Belgium, within the European External Action Service (EEAS).

[East StratcomTask Force](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en). Being a project of the European Union, it is likely funded by the EU’s budget; however, specific funding details are not provided on the website, thereby lacking transparency.
Analysis / Bias
EUvsDisinfo primarily focuses on providing factual and analytical counter-arguments to disinformation. The organization categorizes its articles into specific sections, such as Ukraine,
[Belarus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/belarus-media-profile/), [Moldova](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/moldova-government-and-media-profile/), [Georgia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/georgia-government-and-media-profile/), Eastern Partnership, [China](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/china-media-profile/), and Africa, allowing users to explore disinformation in these regions or topics. It has a [database](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/) of disinformation cases and offers resources for learning more about the topic.
In the articles analyzed, including
[“The Kremlin’s Disinformation Love Song to North Korea,”](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/the-kremlins-disinformation-love-song-to-north-korea/) EUvsDisinfo frequently employs emotionally loaded language. This usage could influence the reader’s perception and suggest an editorial stance that departs from an analytical tone.
In their fact-checking reports, EUvsDisinfo debunks disinformation claims using various sources, each with different biased and factual reporting ratings. For example, in the report titled
[“Israel bombs civilians while Russia hits only military targets,](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/israel-bombs-civilians-while-russia-hits-only-military-targets)” the organization cites sources like [the Times of Israel](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/times-of-israel/) (Left-Center Bias, High factual reporting), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) (Left-Center Bias, Mixed factual reporting), and [Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-europe-radio-liberty/) (Least Biased, Mostly factual reporting). Another source, Ukraine at War, is not rated by Media Bias/Fact Check but focuses on documenting Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine.
EUvsDisinfo seemingly has a minimal left-right bias as they tend to focus on misinformation from authoritarian regimes. However, they have been
[sued by three publications](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2018/three-publications-are-suing-the-eu-over-fake-news-allegations/) in the [Netherlands](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/netherlands-media-profile/) that hold right-leaning anti-EU sentiments. The sources claim that EUvsDisinfo “didn’t label disinformation at all but rather went after news and commentary it didn’t like.” After the lawsuit was initiated, they [retracted the disinformation labels](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2018/03/euvsdisinfo-publicly-retracts-disinformation-labels-after-lawsuit-threats-and-political-pressure.html). Based on this, EUvsDisinfo tends to hold left-leaning political perspectives, as evidenced by mislabeling right-leaning perspectives.
