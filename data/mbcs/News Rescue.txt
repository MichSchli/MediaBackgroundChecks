Analysis / Bias
In review, News Rescue reports news summaries and commentary on Nigerian and international news. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[DOOM: NIGERIANS REACT AS PIGEONS RELEASED BY BUHARI REFUSE TO FLY](https://newsrescue.com/doom-nigerians-react-as-pigeons-released-by-buhari-refuse-to-fly/). They also report on US politics with negative views toward Democratic President Joe Biden such as this [BACK TO DAYS OF US WARS AND INTERVENTIONS: BIDEN SENDS TROOPS INTO SYRIA](https://newsrescue.com/back-to-days-of-us-wars-and-interventions-biden-sends-troops-into-syria/) and this [TIME ADMITS 2020 US ELECTION WAS “RIGGED” BY THE CABAL FOR BIDEN, KAMALA VICTORY](https://newsrescue.com/time-admits-2020-us-election-was-rigged-by-the-cabal-for-biden-kamala-victory/). [Time Magazine’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/) report never mentions the word “rigged.”
News Rescue frequently promotes conspiracy theories regarding
[Covid-19](https://newsrescue.com/covid-19-is-a-man-made-virus-hiv-discoverer-says-could-only-have-been-created-in-a-lab/) as well [anti-vaccination](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) [misinformation](https://newsrescue.com/?s=vaccine). They also routinely source conspiracy website [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) for stories. In general, story selection favors the right and sometimes is not factual.
