Analysis / Bias
Deccan Chronicle’s primary focus is politics, economy, entertainment, external affairs, lifestyles, and culture.
In review, editorial positions are typically pro-government, as demonstrated in this
[article](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/110618/coca-cola-maker-sold-shikanji-rahul-gandhi-left-twitter-in-splits.html) about opposition party leader Rahul Gandhi and this quote from the article: “This is not the first time that Rahul Gandhi has faced flak for such comments. .[…] Needless to say, he lost many in his audience during the explanation.” Further, to prove their points, Deccan Chronicle uses Twitter users’ tweets rather than credible media sources.
For national news, they republish stories from the
[Press Trust of India,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India) which is the most significant news agency in India and [Asian News International (ANI)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/asian-news-international-ani/) Headlines utilize moderately loaded language such as: [“Industrialists got crores, farmers got nothing: Rahul Gandhi attacks Modi govt”](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/110618/industrialists-got-crores-farmers-got-nothing-rahul-gandhi-attacks-m.html) and “ [Congress-free India means getting rid of ‘Congress culture,’ says Amit Shah.”](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/110618/congress-free-india-means-getting-rid-of-congress-culture-says-amit.html)
