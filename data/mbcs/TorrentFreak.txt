Analysis / Bias
TorrentFreak has been recognized for its original reporting on digital issues and is frequently cited by prominent news outlets such as
[The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/), [The Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [De Standaard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/de-standaard-bias/). The website covers a range of topics, including the activities of police intellectual property crime units, U.S. Trade Representative reports anti-piracy web blocking, torrent tracker news, VPN and seedbox reviews, file-sharing website news, copyright law news, and the warez scene.
Articles and headlines typically do not contain emotive language such as this
[Court: Cloudflare is Liable for Pirate Site, But Not as a DNS Provider](https://torrentfreak.com/court-cloudflare-is-liable-for-pirate-site-but-not-as-a-dns-provider-231127/). This story, like all others reviewed, uses proper sourcing with hyperlinks from credible outlets.
TorrentFreak’s editorial stance is committed to balanced reporting, not shying away from reports that either affirm or oppose the view that piracy hurts sales. Further, they do not directly write political op-eds but will report on politics when it pertains to their niche like this:
[Trump Doesn’t Deserve Copyright Win Over Eddie Grant But Still Might Get One](https://torrentfreak.com/trump-doesnt-deserve-copyright-win-over-eddie-grant-but-still-might-get-one-230918/). In this article, the author criticizes the Trump campaign’s use of the fair use defense, implying that it was an abuse of the legal system. The mention of Trump’s team reminding Grant that “some people remain more equal than others” further suggests a critique of Trump’s perceived misuse of power and legal resources. We also found some articles somewhat critical of Joe Biden and his stances on privacy, reflecting a balanced view.
In general, TorrentFreak is fact-based and does not hold traditional left-right biases.
