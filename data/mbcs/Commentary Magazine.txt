History
Founded in 1945,
[Commentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentary_(magazine)) is a monthly American magazine on religion, Judaism, politics, and social and cultural issues. Besides its strong coverage of cultural issues, Commentary historically provided a strong voice for the anti-Stalinist left. [Norman Podhoretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Podhoretz), the founder, originally a liberal Democrat turned neoconservative, moved the magazine to the right and toward the Republican Party in the 1970s and 1980s. The current editor is [John Podhoretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podhoretz), an American writer, a columnist for the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), the author of several books on politics, and a former speechwriter for Presidents [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) and [George H. W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush). The website also provides a [masthead](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/about/) on its about page.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Commentary Magazine publishes original news and opinion pieces that favor neoconservatives and are typically pro-Israel. They also produce several Podcasts per week.
Headlines often use moderately loaded emotional language to sway the reader, such as this:
[Let the Impeachment Turf War Begin](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/politics-ideas/let-the-impeachment-turf-war-begin/). This story is credibly sourced to the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/). Although this is a conservative-leaning publication, they do not always align with the former Trump administration: [Trump Did This to Himself](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/politics-ideas/donald-trump-did-this-to-himself-impeachment/). Regarding science, Commentary does not outright reject the human impact on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/); however, they do not support government solutions and sometimes use wording that misleads on the impact, such as this: [The Worst Climate Change Canard](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/culture-civilization/the-worst-climate-change-canard/). While they don’t promote blatant misinformation regarding Covid-19, they often minimize it: [The Last Gasp of Covid Fanaticism](https://www.commentary.org/noah-rothman/the-people-covid-broke/).
Commentary Magazine is very well written, with almost all stories favoring the right; however, they oppose the former Trump Administration’s brand of Conservatism and usually properly source their information.
