Analysis / Bias
In review, Metabunk consists of people who post forum questions that are answered by other members and Mick West. For example, a thread was created to investigate a potential UFO,
[Black UFO At Skinwalker Ranch (A Fly)](https://www.metabunk.org/threads/black-ufo-at-skinwalker-ranch-a-fly.11271/). Users prove it is actually a black fly that crossed in front of the lense. They also debunk ridiculous conspiracies such as Coronavirus being spread by 5G [Debunking Correlations Between 5G deployments and Coronavirus](https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunking-correlations-between-5g-deployments-and-coronavirus.11196/). In general, this is a pro-science source that debunks pseudoscience and conspiracy theories through evidence.
