History
Founded in 2016 by Malcolm Teasdale, America Out Loud is a conservative news and opinion website that promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience through the website and podcasts. According to their
[about page](https://www.americaoutloud.com/who-we-are/), “America Out Loud has evolved into an American values media colossus, bringing you unbridled and unadulterated facts, opinions, analyses, and truer-than-life stories voiced through the magic of talk radio and print media. Critically, we’re Americans willing to research the issues and events of the day and to say what must be said to keep us all informed of the evil politics and machinations of the Marxist Left.”
Malcolm Teasdale does not use his name on the website but uses an alias called Malcolm Out Loud.

Analysis / Bias
America Out Loud publishes columns, podcasts, and videos from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines often contain emotionally loaded wording
[Congressional Shell Game Sells America Out to China and Mexico](https://www.americaoutloud.com/congressional-shell-game-sells-america-out-to-china-and-mexico/). This story relies on credible sources such as [The Verge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/). However, in reviewing numerous articles, we found many instances of poor sources that routinely promote conspiracy theories and false claims, such as [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), and [NOQ Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/noq-report/).
Editorially, all stories favor the right and are often fear-based and emotional when reporting on Marxism/globalism, such as
[The Legacy of Leftism: Dysfunctionality Promoted as Aberrant Normalcy](https://www.americaoutloud.com/the-legacy-of-leftism-dysfunctionality-promoted-as-aberrant-normalcy/). Other topics of concern for America Out Loud are critical race theory, [immigration,](https://www.americaoutloud.com/is-dhs-the-new-department-of-subversion-is-mayorkas-the-new-innkeeper/) and [replacement theory](https://www.americaoutloud.com/the-fundamental-changing-of-american-society-is-underway/).
Finally, since 2020 America Out Loud has continued to promote conspiracy theories regarding the Presidential Election of 2020
[Evidence of Electoral Fraud is Mounting, Americans Must Rise to Oppose It](https://www.americaoutloud.com/evidence-of-electoral-fraud-is-mounting-americans-must-rise-to-oppose-it/). Further, they frequently promote disinformation and pseudoscience regarding Covid-19, such as this [One mRNA, One Spike Protein, 1291 Diseases, Unlimited Ways to Die](https://www.americaoutloud.com/one-mrna-one-spike-protein-1291-diseases-unlimited-ways-to-die/). This article is written by Dr. Peter McCullough, who frequently promotes [false information](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Dr.%20Peter%20McCullough) regarding Covid-19. Generally, America Out Loud is a conspiracy and pseudoscience site; however, due to their hyper-partisan conservative agenda, we rate them Questionable due to strong political bias.
