History
Interpreter Mag (I.M.) was founded by the
[Atlantic Council](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/atlantic-council/), a nonpartisan organization that promotes cooperation between the United States and Europe. I.M. was established to translate articles from the Russian press into other languages. Its stance has changed significantly since then, according to its About page: “Little did we realize then that the Interpreter would devote as much energy to covering what the Russian Federation got up to outside of its own borders.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Today I.M. covers, as stated, Russia’s involvement in international affairs, primarily focused on Syria, Crimea, and the war in Ukraine. They also have a daily podcast covering the same range of topics. The articles are well written and factual, with a noticeable anti-Putin and Russian government stance. I.M. does have a small amount of U.S.-related news, although it is primarily about the investigations of Russian involvement in the election.
