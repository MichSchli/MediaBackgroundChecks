The website completely lacks transparency as there is not an about page, nor disclosure of ownership, [an editor is not named](https://tribunist.com/editorial-and-advisory-board/), and news stories do not list author names.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Tribunist presents news and opinions with a right-leaning conservative bias. Headlines and articles utilize only moderate loaded emotional language such as this:
[Trump Doubles Down on Iran After Oil Attack “US Locked and Loaded”](https://tribunist.com/news/trump-doubles-down-on-iran-after-oil-attack-us-locked-and-loaded/). This story like most on the website utilizes proper sources. In this case, they source to [ABC News](https://tribunist.com/news/trump-doubles-down-on-iran-after-oil-attack-us-locked-and-loaded/). In another [article](https://tribunist.com/news/us-air-force-drops-80000-pounds-of-bombs-on-iraqi-island-infested-with-isis-fighters-video/) they utilize video and link to [Military.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/military-com/). In general, story selection favors the right, but not in an overt manner.
