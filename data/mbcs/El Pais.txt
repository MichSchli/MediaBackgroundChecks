In review, El Pais publishes articles written by experts with minimally emotionally loaded language, such as
[“Why science should revolutionize the world of politics”](https://english.elpais.com/science_tech/2020-06-07/why-science-should-revolutionize-the-world-of-politics.html) and articles related to national politics [“After bitter debate in Congress, Spain’s PM secures extension to state of alarm](https://english.elpais.com/politics/2020-06-03/after-bitter-debate-in-congress-spains-pm-secures-extension-to-state-of-alarm.html).” El Pais typically reports all sides; for example, in the above-mentioned article, they report the Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez’s (center-left) perspective, as well as the opposition parties’ perspectives, such as the conservative People’s Party (PP) leader Pablo Casado’s and The leader of the far-right Vox, Santiago Abascal’s perspective.
When it comes to sourcing, El Pais international’s coverage utilizes both news agency material as well as foreign correspondents. El Pais also has

In covering the USA, most articles are neutral when reporting news such as this
