Analysis / Bias
In review, The Laconia Daily Sun publishes local news, community announcements, events, local business news, real estate columns, and classifieds. Local information is presented with minimal bias, such as this
[Anonymous stranger helped return phone to Gilford woman](https://www.laconiadailysun.com/news/local/anonymous-stranger-helped-return-phone-to-gilford-woman/article_358899ec-4e86-11ea-adbb-8b380034e79e.html). Most local and community news is low biased in the presentation.
Editorially, The Laconia Daily Sun presents both left-center and right-center perspectives without using extremes. For example, this editorial supports the dangers of climate change and the actions that need to occur:
[Froma Harrop: Do US carmakers want us to like them?](https://www.laconiadailysun.com/opinion/columns/froma-harrop-do-us-carmakers-want-us-to-like-them/article_54e945ba-0d55-11ea-9b9a-9f5f6c9390be.html) While we could not find any editorials that deny human-influenced climate change, the paper routinely publishes letters to the editor with differing viewpoints, such as this: [Climate change alarmists are on the wrong side of history](https://www.laconiadailysun.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/climate-change-alarmists-are-on-the-wrong-side-of-history/article_f71213c6-ae3c-11e9-b751-63e616ab4f41.html).
The paper does not offer editorial coverage; however, the story selection of news stories concerning Trump often leans toward the negative. However, when covering
[Bernie Sanders](https://www.laconiadailysun.com/search/?f=html&q=bernie+sanders&s=start_time&sd=desc&l=25&t=article&nsa=eedition), there tends to be more favorable reporting, though letters to the editor offer [strong criticism](https://www.laconiadailysun.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/sanders-despises-the-capitalism-that-makes-us-great/article_bc129328-49a9-11ea-a89c-23bed5b3b730.html). They generally cover news factually and with minimal bias, whereas op-ed coverage tends to lean slightly left but is reasonably balanced.
