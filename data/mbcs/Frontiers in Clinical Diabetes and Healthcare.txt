[Frontiers Media](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frontiers/) has been criticized for being a predatory open-access publisher. [In short](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03759-y), Predatory Open Access publishing is an exploitative open-access publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without providing the editorial and publishing services associated with legitimate journals.
