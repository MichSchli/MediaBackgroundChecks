Analysis / Bias
In review, the magazine and website publish news related to archaeology and discoveries. The information is presented for a lay reader to understand. Articles and headlines do not use loaded language, such as this
[Erosion Exposes Shipwreck on Florida Beach](https://www.archaeology.org/news/9218-201118-florida-beach-shipwreck). While most stories originate from other sources such as local media, others are derived from peer-reviewed studies but written in an easily digestible way.
