Analysis / Bias
Freethink Media owns
[BIG THINK](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-think/), BIG THINK PLUS, SMARTER FASTER trademarks. For example, if you click on “Explore” under the progress issue, you will be redirected to “Big Think.”
In review, Freethink publishes articles with moderately loaded headlines, such as
[Morocco has a doomsday seed vault. We stepped inside](https://www.freethink.com/series/just-might-work?media_id=DtkJcYNq). Typically, their stories favor the left, such as [“The Great Progression 2025-2050.”](https://bigthink.com/progress/the-great-progression-peter-leyden/) A quote from the article reads: “The mainstream California progressives like Newsom in that way are pro-business, pro-entrepreneur, pro-technology, pro-innovation — pro-progress.” The article also states, “But California, more than any other state, is fully engaged in solving those future challenges, from climate change (now phasing out the sale of gas autos by 2035) to dealing with the diversity of its population (now only 35 percent white).” The claim that California’s population is “35 percent white” is accurate according to [census data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA) but not linked to a source.
However, most Freethink articles are sourced diligently, such as this article,
[“Russia’s cyberattacks foreshadow the future of war.”](https://www.freethink.com/technology/ukraine-russia-cyberattacks) For example, Freethink utilizes credible sources such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Vice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vice-news/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), [Wired](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/), [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), [MIT Technology Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mit-technology-review/), [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [ABC News Australia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news-australia/), [Business Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-standard-india/), [Washingtonian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washingtonian-bias-credibility-rating/), and [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) They also republish articles from the [Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/).
Editorially, Freethink promotes left-leaning pro-science positions such as concern for
[climate change](https://www.freethink.com/environment/climate-change-charts), fact-based reporting on [Covid-19](https://www.freethink.com/health/universal-coronavirus-vaccine-46654), and [support](https://www.freethink.com/social-change/the-crib-a-place-to-call-home-for-lgbtq-young-adults) for the LGBTQ community. In general, Freethink is fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
