History
[Founded in 2012](http://whois.domaintools.com/100percentfedup.com), 100 Percent Fed Up is a far-right news and opinion blog. According to their [about page](https://100percentfedup.com/about/), “We are two moms inspired by the life of Andrew Breitbart. We’re exposing the lies of the left & MSM propagandists.” They further state, “Our goal is to expose the lies and hypocrisy of the progressives in academia, the entertainment industry, and MSM through the use of social media.” Unfortunately, like most questionable sources, they do not list ownership nor authors/staff associated with the website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, 100 Percent Fed Up reports news with an extreme right-wing bias in reporting. All news favors the right and denigrates the left through the use of loaded emotional wording such as these:
[WATCH TRUMP GREETED by Huge Crowd of Jubilant Supporters in Florida](https://100percentfedup.com/watch-trump-greeted-by-huge-crowd-of-jubilant-supporters-in-florida/) (Greeted, Huge, Jubilant to promote Trump) and [LIBERALS FREAK Over Discovery That Betsy DeVos’ Brother Financed Effort To Find Hillary’s Emails](https://100percentfedup.com/liberals-freak-over-discovery-that-betsy-devos-brother-financed-effort-to-find-hillarys-emails/) (“Liberals Freak” and within the article they use “crooked Hillary,” a negative connotation, in an attempt to denigrate the left).
When it comes to sourcing information, 100 Percent Fed Up typically provides links to mostly mainstream sources and then follows with hyper-partisan biased opinions that favor the right. However, they also occasionally
[utilize](https://100percentfedup.com/texas-muslims-praying-in-methodist-church-claim-sharia-is-just-like-the-constitution-video/) right-wing conspiracy sources such as [InfoWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/). Politically, this website thoroughly endorses the conservative platform.
