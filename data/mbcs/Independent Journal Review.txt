Analysis / Bias
Based on our previous review of IJR, they were a conservative news website with high factual reporting. Today it appears that IJR writers post stories. For example, the story
[Pelosi Says Art Depicting the Founding Fathers Should Not Come Down](https://ijr.org/pelosi-responds-to-criticisms-of-art-depicting-the-founding-fathers/) comes from an author/poster who does not have a bio. This article is not particularly biased but is strictly sourced back to IJR. Most stories are summaries of larger national stories such as this: [Nearly $1.4 Billion in Coronavirus Stimulus Checks Went to Dead People: Report](https://ijr.org/trump-stimulus-checks-went-to-dead-people-report/). This story is properly sourced to the [Government Accountability Office](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/us-government-accountability-office-gao/). Finally, they also republish stories from low-biased credible sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/).
Editorially, most stories favor a conservative perspective such as this
[Cruz Praises Texas for Passing Elections Bill While Torching ‘Washington Elites’](https://ijr.com/cruz-texas-passing-elections-bill-torching-washington-elites/). Articles listed under the commentary section are usually republished from the Far-Right and Questionable [Western Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/) that frequently fails fact checks. A review of opinion content indicates that most favor the right.
