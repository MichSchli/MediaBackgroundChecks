In review, the South Bend Tribune covers local news through journalists and national/international news via the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Local news is covered with minimal loaded emotional language such as this: [Buchanan medical marijuana businesses get state approval.](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/buchanan-medical-marijuana-businesses-get-state-approval/article_f0fb0546-f8ab-5d5f-9a42-6282f7fefb57.html) Further, they properly source infomation. Editorially, the South Bend Tribune endorses both Democratic and Republican candidates; however, they endorse slightly more Democrats in a 2016 count. The opinion pages reflect a diversity of thought that is mostly balanced and strays from extremes.
