Analysis / Bias
ThinkPol provides investigative journalism and news reporting on Canadian political issues. Articles and headlines typically are not sensational and usually favor a left-leaning perspective, such as this
[Gap between rich and poor widens at fastest pace on record – Statistics Canada.](https://thinkpol.ca/2023/07/04/gap-between-rich-and-poor-widens-at-fastest-pace-on-record-statistics-canada/)
Editorially, ThinkPol aligns more with a progressive perspective such as this
[Global warming could suffocate life on Earth as oxygen levels fall, research shows](https://thinkpol.ca/2015/12/01/global-warming-could-suffocate-life-on-earth-as-oxygen-levels-fall-research-shows/), and [Canadian Government pressured to recognize human rights abuses in Mexico](https://thinkpol.ca/2017/10/21/canadian-government-pressured-to-recognize-human-rights-abuses-in-mexico/). When reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they tend to be sympathetic toward the Palestinians, like [Israeli nationalists wage battle against Palestinian flag](https://thinkpol.ca/2022/06/05/israeli-nationalists-wage-battle-against-palestinian-flag/). In general, the news reporting is fact-based and holds a moderate left-leaning political bias.
