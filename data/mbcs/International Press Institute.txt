History
The
[International Press Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Press_Institute) (IPI) is a global organization dedicated to promoting and protecting press freedom and the improvement of journalism practices. Founded in October 1950, the IPI has members in over 120 countries.
The IPI is a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organizations that monitors press freedom and free expression violations worldwide.
According to their
[about page](https://ipi.media/about/), “IPI members work cooperatively to shape the debate on policies affecting the media and to push back against those seeking to restrict the free flow of news and information in order to protect political, economic, or other interests. Equally important, IPI membership offers solidarity in the face of oppression.” [Read our profile on Austria’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/austria-media-profile/)
