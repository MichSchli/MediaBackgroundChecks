Analysis / Bias
In review, The Intellectualist publishes summaries or partial text of news articles and then links to the full story. Most stories come from the least biased and left-leaning sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Story selection significantly favors the left with many stories negative toward the right such as this: [DeVos: I Am Pro-Freedom, That’s Why I Discriminate Against People Not Like Me.](https://mavenroundtable.io/theintellectualist/news/devos-i-am-pro-freedom-that-s-why-i-discriminate-against-people-not-like-me-VxX9qQSRuEmnBeNxQzH74w/) This story comes from the [Detroit Free Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/detroit-free-press/) with a much different title that is not biased: [Betsy DeVos: It’s not about me, it’s about students](https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2019/05/06/betsy-devos-education-secretary-schools/1118730001/).
