Based in
[Wisconsin](https://www.advocate.com/news/gays-against-groomers-exposed), it gained attention for using the term “groomer” in a derogatory manner against the LGBTQ+ community. Criticized by [The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) and The [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) (SPLC) for spreading [misleading narratives](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/online-amplifiers-anti-lgbtq-extremism) and being an [anti-LGBTQ+](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2023/10/20/anti-lgbtq-rallies-buoyed-big-right-wing-money) extremist group, [GLAAD](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/glaad/) describes Gays Against Groomers as a national organization that uses harmful language to attack LGBTQ-inclusive policies and mischaracterizes gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth. The group frequently collaborates with [Moms for Liberty](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/moms-for-liberty-bias/) to disseminate this harmful rhetoric.

Analysis / Bias
Led by
[Michell,](https://twitter.com/thegaywhostrayd) with figures like [Sasha Leigh](https://www.gaysagainstgroomers.com/team) and David Leatherwood, GAG is viewed as a right-wing group, not grassroots. Its rhetoric, often involving the term [“groomer,” ](https://www.advocate.com/news/gays-against-groomers-exposed#:~:text=Gays%20Against%20Groomers%20sells%20merchandise,and%20is%20registered%20in%20Wisconsin)positions LGBTQ+ individuals as threats, especially in education. The group has been linked to the “Stop the Steal” movement and other far-right activities, and its leaders have a history of involvement in right-wing extremism and conspiracy theories.
Michell, for instance, has been involved in spreading QAnon conspiracy theories and expressed support for the January 6 insurrection. Leatherwood, another prominent figure in the group, also has ties to the
[“Stop the Steal”](https://www.them.us/story/gays-against-groomers-extremists-trump-operatives) movement and has celebrated the January 6 events.
Based on their rhetoric and actions, the ADL and the SPLC have identified Gays Against Groomers as an anti-LGBTQ extremist group. The group’s activities have had real-world impacts, including the incitement of harassment and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals and communities.
Key Document Analysis
The “Newspaper” category under the “More” section provides access to publications and downloadable materials produced by Gays Against Groomers. We analyzed the document from the “Newspaper” category titled
[“The Transgender Bill of Rights: Gay Erasure and the End of Childhood Innocence,”](https://www.gaysagainstgroomers.com/_files/ugd/655098_8f5a6da20d274e579734ee284ecbba3e.pdf) which expresses strong opposition to LGBTQ+ inclusion in education, particularly targeting transgender rights.
The group uses strong, emotionally loaded language to argue that such inclusion is harmful to children, demonstrating a clear bias against transgender individuals. A representative quote from the document is: “These ‘transgender rights’ activist lunatics can try all they want, but we will not back down until this movement is destroyed. Gay rights grant gay & lesbian adults the freedom to live our lives as who we are. ‘Trans rights’ force society to rearrange and affirm people as what they are not,” which exemplifies their critical stance and emotive rhetoric. The document’s tone is provocative, lacking a balanced perspective and relying more on ideological assertions than empirical evidence.
In general, Gays Against Groomers (GAG) presents a highly biased viewpoint against LGBTQ+ rights, employing rhetoric that has been condemned as hate speech and fueling a climate of fear and hostility towards LGBTQ+ individuals. Its connections to far-right movements and its usage of extremist rhetoric place it firmly within right-wing activism, far from the grassroots community advocacy it claims to represent. Finally, this source frequently promotes misinformation and makes false claims, as evidenced by failed fact checks below.
