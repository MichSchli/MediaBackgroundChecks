Analysis / Bias
The National covers local news for Scotland through reporters with minimal bias, such as this
[Multinational fertiliser company extracting peat in planning breach, documents allege](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23070964.multinational-fertiliser-company-extracting-peat-planning-breach-documents-allege/). Regarding sourcing, they rely on first-person accounts and large quotes, which is appropriate for a print publication.
National and international news is usually republished through reliable sources such as
[PA Media](https://pamediagroup.com/) (national news agency for the UK and Ireland) and [The Sunday Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/).
Editorially, story selection and op-eds offer some balance; however, The National openly endorses the Center-Left Scottish National Party, which advocates for
[Scottish Independence](https://www.thenational.scot/news/scottish-independence/) from the United Kingdom. For example, [Boost for Scottish independence as new poll puts Yes up four points](https://www.thenational.scot/news/23068579.boost-scottish-independence-new-poll-puts-yes-four-points/). Generally, the news is fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
