Analysis / Bias
In review, one article titled
[“You bought underwear from govt purse: Garba Shehu blasts ex-military gov for criticizing Buhari”](https://dailytrust.com/you-bought-underwear-from-govt-purse-garba-shehu-blasts-ex-military-gov-for-criticising-buhari/) focuses on a political exchange between Garba Shehu, a spokesperson for President Buhari, and an ex-military governor. The article employs emotionally loaded language like “blasts” in the headline, which could indicate a sensationalist tone. Additionally, the story focuses primarily on Garba Shehu’s comments, which may suggest an inclination to highlight the official government viewpoint.
Another article titled
[“Banky W, Obanikoro’s Son Get Another Opportunity as Tribunal Nullifies Victory of Labour Party Rep”](https://dailytrust.com/banky-w-obanikoros-son-get-another-opportunity-as-tribunal-nullifies-victory-of-labour-party-rep/) discusses a legal victory that provides Banky W and Obanikoro’s son another opportunity in a political race. The article remains largely neutral, reporting on the events and the tribunal’s decision without expressing favoritism or overt bias.
Regarding cited references, both articles use extensive quotes but do not include hyperlinks to external information or data, limiting the reader’s ability to verify the claims made easily.
