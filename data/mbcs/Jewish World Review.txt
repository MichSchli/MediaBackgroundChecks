Analysis / Bias
In review, Jewish World Review has a right-leaning conservative bias in story selection and many times does not properly source information in articles. For example, in the article entitled: “
[REVEALED: The Obama administration’s support for Hamas was not passive](http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0317/glick030317.php3),” there is not a single link to an external source to support the claim that Obama actively supported Hamas. Further, the author of this piece is from the [Dave Horowitz Freedom Center](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/david-horowitz-freedom-center/), a far right-wing anti-Islam organization.
Generally, story selection always favors the right and comes from authors such as
[Ben Shapiro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ben-shapiro-bias-rating/), Brent Bozell, and David Limbaugh. All of these authors have failed fact checks.
