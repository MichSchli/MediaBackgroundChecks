Analysis / Bias
In 2022, Singapore was ranked 139/180 by
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) in the [Press Freedom Index.](https://rsf.org/en/singapore) In their report, they state, “As a result of judicial and financial pressure from the authorities, self-censorship is widespread, including within the alternative, independent media.”
[Lee Hsien Loong](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/National-Day-Message-2019) the current Prime Minister of Singapore. He is also the Secretary-General of the center-right [People’s Action Party ( PAP). ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)The Singapore Government controls CNA, and the Government is known for its conservative Center-right stance.
In review, when covering Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, CNA utilizes a neutral tone in their headlines such as this
[“Don’t ‘drop workers’: Companies and workers should take the long view, says PM Lee in May Day message](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/may-day-covid-19-companies-workers-take-long-view-pm-lee-12692086).” On the other hand, when covering opposition Workers Party leader Pritam Singh, they also maintain a neutral tone [“WP’s Pritam Singh calls for ‘thorough review’ of Singaporean living wage following ‘useful lessons’ from COVID-19”.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/solidarity-budget-wp-pritam-singh-review-of-living-wage-12614322) Therefore they give equal voice to both sides. Furthermore, they source through quotes rather than hyperlinks.
CNA typically syndicates to low-biased credible news sources such as
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) when covering world news pertaining to the USA.
