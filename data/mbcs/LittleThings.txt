Analysis / Bias
LittleThings publishes uplifting human interest stories focusing on health and parenting. Articles and headlines do not use overly emotional wording such as this
[Moms Who Got Sober During The Health Crisis Open Up About What It Was Like](https://littlethings.com/family-and-parenting/sober-moms). However, some stories have sensational headlines, such as this [Bindi Irwin Gets Surprised By Her Husband And Brother With Terrifying Nursery Theme](https://littlethings.com/family-and-parenting/bindi-irwin-nursery-surprise).
Editorially, LittleThings aligns with the left reporting negatively on conservatives such as this
[Mary Trump Is Reportedly Set To Take Down Her Famous Family With ‘Harrowing’ Details In New Book](https://littlethings.com/family-and-parenting/mary-trump-new-book) and reporting positively on President Joe Biden [Major Biden Had His ‘Indoguration’ And Raised Over $200,000 For The Rescue He Came From](https://littlethings.com/pets/major-biden-indoguration).
When it comes to science, LittleThings prefers Pseudo. For example, they promote liver detox,
[8 Foods To Eat And 4 To Avoid In Order To Detox Your Liver In A Safe And Healthy Way](https://littlethings.com/lifestyle/liver-detox), where there is [no evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-dubious-practice-of-detox) to support it. They also promote Acupressure, [Acupressure Points And Their Surprising Health Benefits](https://littlethings.com/lifestyle/health-benefits-of-acupressure-points), which again [lacks evidence](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-acupressure/). They have also published false information, as seen below, in failed fact checks.
