History
[Founded in 1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace), Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization with offices in over 55 countries and an international coordinating body in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Greenpeace states [its goal](https://web.archive.org/web/20100411091859/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/faq/questions-about-greenpeace-in) is to “ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity” and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. The current executive director is Jennifer Morgan. [Read our profile on the Netherlands government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/netherlands-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Greenpeace is funded through donations. The organization does not accept money from governments, intergovernmental organizations, political parties, or corporations to avoid their influence. However, Greenpeace does receive money from the National Postcode Lottery, the biggest government-sponsored lottery in the Netherlands.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Greenpeace advocates for the environment through multiple channels. Our focus is on the content of their website. The website features popups for donations as a call to action, such as this “Donald Trump wants to bail out the oil industry instead of caring for families during this health and economic crisis. Help us hold him accountable.” As can be seen, they do not hold a favorable view of the Trump administration. The website also features a climate scorecard that rates candidates on how well they support
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) legislation: [WHERE’S YOUR 2020 CANDIDATE ON CLIMATE?](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/climate2020/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=actioncard&utm_campaign=climate_scorecard) If you are wondering, Bernie Sanders, scores 94/100, Biden 72/100, and Donald Trump 0/100.
While Greenpeace is generally pro-science on most issues, they differ strongly with GMOs. For example, virtually all articles oppose
[GMOs](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/?s=gmo) despite science indicating their safety. Therefore, we rate GreenPeace a moderate pseudoscience website.
