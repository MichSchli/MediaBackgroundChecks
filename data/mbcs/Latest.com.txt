Analysis / Bias
In review, Latest.com is a news and opinion website with a borderline extreme left bias. All articles favor the left and denigrate the right. There is significant use of loaded language such as: “
[Fake News Spreader in Chief Donald Trump lied that the Obama administration “legalized” bump stocks on Twitter Friday.](https://latest.com/2018/03/donald-trump-blatantly-lies-that-obama-legalized-bump-stocks/)” Although Latest.com uses very strong emotional language they always source their information. However, sometimes they use [poor sources](https://latest.com/2017/03/sean-spicer-admits-its-possible-intel-leaked-to-rep-nunes-came-from-white-house/) that frequently fail fact checks, such as the [Palmer Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/palmer-report/). For the most part Latest.com is factual in reporting, though misleading due to the language they use.
