History
Right Wing News was founded by John Hawkins in 2001, a far-right conservative, who regularly contributes articles to right-wing publications. There are currently three Right Wing News websites. The original is found at rightwingnews.com and owned by John Hawkins, which typically publishes only Hawkins’ articles and podcasts. You can see a review of that site
[here](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/right-wing-news/). In 2018, Right Wing News merged with MediaVines, inc. They currently operate two other Right Wing News websites at the domains: rightwing.news and rwnofficial.com. These two domains look identical and have the same about page information. For the purpose of this review, we will look at rightwing.news as they have current news stories, whereas rwnofficial has not published a story in over a week as of 12/5/2018. The about page for rightwing.news reads: “Right Wing News publishes content that is traditional news, opinion based and is consistent with conservative values.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, virtually every headline and article on Right Wing News utilizes very strong loaded emotional language such as
[Pelosi Immediately Stabs Trump In The Back After Becoming Speaker – Illegals Cheering!](https://rightwing.news/pelosi-immediately-stabs-trump-in-the-back-after-becoming-speaker-illegals-cheering/) This article sources the Questionable extreme right [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which has failed numerous fact checks. In general, all articles favor the right in story selection and denigrate the left. Further, many are very poorly sourced to other questionable and/or factually mixed right-wing sources.
