Analysis / Bias
In review, The Rock Hill Herald covers local news, sports, weather, and crime through reporters. Articles and headlines are often minimally biased, such as this:
[Earth Fare to close all stores, including 7 around Charlotte and 2 in the Triangle](https://www.heraldonline.com/latest-news/article239913923.html). National and international news is provided by the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). The website features a section for politics and government news that generally offers syndicated content from other McClatchy properties and the Associated Press.
Editorially, The Herald has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates such as Barack Obama in 2012. The opinion page tends to lean left with articles such as this:
[ As Trump threatens Americans, guess whose senators are silent?](https://www.heraldonline.com/opinion/article231028348.html#storylink=mainstage) And [The governor should get louder on Medicaid expansion](https://www.heraldonline.com/opinion/editorials/article231427808.html#storylink=mainstage). In general, they report factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
