Analysis / Bias
COED publishes news and analysis on entertainment news, Covid-19, economics, lifestyle, and politics. Articles and headlines contain minimally loaded language such as this
[Man Faces 20 Years In Prison For Selling Fake COVID Vaccination Cards](https://coed.com/2021/12/07/man-faces-20-years-in-prison-for-selling-fake-covid-vaccination-cards/). Articles are properly sourced from credible media outlets such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), local news stations, and justice.gov.
Editorially, COED does not have a dedicated opinion section; however, they report on political issues with a left-leaning bias. For example, many articles argue for marijuana legalization
[Illinois Governor Pardons Over 11,000 People With Low-Level Marijuana Convictions.](https://coed.com/2020/01/01/illinois-marijuana-pardons/) Other articles focus on [climate change](https://coed.com/2019/09/10/is-the-media-taking-climate-change-in-hollywood-seriously/) and [social justice](https://coed.com/2018/11/27/rider-university-bans-chick-fil-a-lgbtq-stance/). Generally, stories are mostly factual and hold a left-leaning editorial bias through story selection.
