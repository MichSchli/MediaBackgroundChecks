Analysis / Bias
Open to Debate employs a debate format for discussing political issues, aiming to offer balanced viewpoints by selecting diverse topics and debaters. However, our analysis is based on summaries and participant backgrounds, not full hour-long debate videos. We also analyzed a comedy event based on a provided transcript.
The debate
[“Mock Trial: Is Trump Guilty in the January 6th Case?”](https://opentodebate.org/debate/mock-trial-is-trump-guilty-in-the-january-6th-case/) features [Lanny Davis](https://opentodebate.org/debaters/lanny-davis/), a background in politics and law, and [Sara Azari](https://opentodebate.org/debaters/sara-azari/), a criminal defense attorney/legal analyst for [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/) and prominent networks. While Davis is associated with liberal politics, Azari’s political leanings remain unclear. Our examination of Azari’s [interview](https://www.womencriminaldefenseattorneys.com/blog/interview-of-sara-azari) from the Women Criminal Defense Attorneys blog found no explicit references to her political leanings; her focus is on legal expertise and education. Legal experts [Joel Cohen](https://opentodebate.org/cross-examiner/joel-cohen/) and [Randall Eliason](https://opentodebate.org/cross-examiner/randall-eliason/) add depth, but their political affiliations are not explicitly known.
The Debate’s structure allows for in-depth exploration of arguments, but potential bias may arise from participants’ backgrounds and leanings. The Debate’s impartiality depends on moderation and cross-examiners’ effectiveness in balancing discussions.
Our analysis of Open to Debate, especially the “Mock Trial: Is Trump Guilty in the January 6th Case?” debate, is limited by video length and accessibility. We drew conclusions from the debate structure, participants’ backgrounds, and the platform’s overall approach. While these elements suggest an intention for balanced discussion, a full assessment of impartiality requires a thorough review of complete debate content. Therefore, while indications of a balanced approach are present, a definitive assessment of overall impartiality is not possible within this analysis.
Additionally, based on the provided
[transcript](https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-wokeness-killing-comedy-live-debate-in-nyc/), we analyzed live comedy events from Open to Debate. The event [“Is Wokeness Killing Comedy?”](https://opentodebate.org/newsletter-is-wokeness-killing-comedy/) examines whether wokeness restricts comedians and stifles comedic creativity or enhances comedy by broadening its scope and promoting social consciousness. Both debaters provide differing viewpoints. Lou Perez argues that wokeness, focusing on power structures and the potential for censorship, harms comedic creativity and freedom. Michael Ian Black counters that comedy is more successful than ever, with wokeness contributing to thoughtfulness and inclusivity, expanding the range of voices in the field. The platform encourages balanced discussions and diverse viewpoints, aligning with Open to Debate’s commitment to encompassing multiple perspectives in its content.
While Open to Debate has not directly failed a fact-check, some of the debaters have
[failed fact-checks](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/jul/27/anthony-scaramucci/it-felony-leak-financial-disclosure-form-anthony-s/), such as [Anthony Scaramucci](https://opentodebate.org/debaters/anthony-scaramucci/), who was briefly Press Secretary for Former President Trump. Finally, it is also difficult to individually verify debaters’ claims as they may not always provide a source for the information they present.
