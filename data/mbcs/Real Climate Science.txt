History
[Founded in 2015](http://whois.domaintools.com/realclimatescience.com), Real Climate Science is a skeptical climate science blog created by Tony Heller (formerly known as [Steven Goddard](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Steven_Goddard)). According to their [about page,](https://realclimatescience.com/who-is-tony-heller/) Tony Heller is an electrical engineer who worked as a science teacher and geologist. The page further states, “climate science doesn’t work because it is done largely by dishonest, incompetent hacks who don’t follow or even understand any legitimate methodology.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Real Climate Science is the personal blog of Tony Heller, whose mission is to debunk the consensus that
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is strongly human-influenced. Articles and headlines often feature highly emotional wording such as this [Alarmists Using Children For Climate Fodder](https://realclimatescience.com/2020/01/alarmists-using-children-for-climate-fodder/). This is a video story narrated by Tony Heller that claims the solutions for climate change are the same as communism. Politically, Real Climate Science aligns with the right through the support of former President Trump’s environmental deregulation and human-influenced climate change denial [Obama’s Plan Vs. Trump’s Plan](https://realclimatescience.com/2020/01/obamas-plan-vs-trumps-plan/). In general, Tony Heller and his Real Climate Science blog believe that climate change is [The Biggest Fraud In History](https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/the-biggest-fraud-in-history/). This theory is at odds with the [consensus of science.](https://climate.nasa.gov/) According to a recent report by [Cornell University](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change), “More than 99.9% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that climate change is mainly caused by humans, according to a new survey of 88,125 climate-related studies.”
Most of the information published on this blog is not derived from peer-reviewed research; in fact, Mr. Heller explains why peer-reviewed studies in climate change are “worthless”
[Why Climate Science Peer Review Is Worthless](https://realclimatescience.com/why-climate-science-peer-review-is-worthless/). In general, Real Climate Science is opposed to Real Climate Science.
