History
Founded in 2018, The Colorado Sun is a Denver-based news and journalism website. According to their
[about page](https://coloradosun.com/about-us/), they strive to “cover all of Colorado so that our state — our community — can better understand itself.” They further state, “We are committed to fact-based, in-depth, and non-partisan journalism. We cover everything from politics and culture to the outdoor industry and education.”
The Colorado Sun is transparent as they list all staff, with Larry Ryckman serving as editor.
Eight former employees of
[The Denver Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/denver-post/) started The Colorado Sun in response to multiple layoffs at the Denver Post after the Post’s acquisition by the private equity firm [Alden Global Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alden_Global_Capital).

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Colorado Sun produces original news reporting and long-form journalism and republishes stories from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Articles and headlines typically do not report with emotional language such as this: [Gov. Jared Polis declares state of emergency in response to a coronavirus outbreak](https://coloradosun.com/2020/03/10/colorado-state-of-emergency-coronavirus-jared-polis/). Like all stories published by the Colorado Sun, there is proper sourcing within each article. News is categorized into sections, with one section dedicated to Politics. Stories in this section tend to cover both sides of issues and minimize editorializing such as this: [Colorado issues, like fracking and marijuana, divide the Democratic candidates for president](https://coloradosun.com/2020/02/18/colorado-democratic-presidential-candidates-fracking-marijuana/).
The website also features opinion columns that strike a reasonable balance. However, a review of dozens demonstrates more that favor the left, such as this:
[Silverman: How did extreme right-wingers take over Colorado’s Republican Party?](https://coloradosun.com/2020/03/09/trump-core-gardner-election-politics-opinion/) and this [Carman: When the spit hits the fan, universal access to health care is critical](https://coloradosun.com/2020/03/15/coronavirus-covid-19-health-care-colorado-opinion/). Generally, the news is reported factually and with strong sourcing, while editorials tend to lean left.
