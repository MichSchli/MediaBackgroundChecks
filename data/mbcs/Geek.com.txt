History
[Founded in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek.com), Geek.com is a technology news weblog about hardware, mobile computing, technology, movies, TV, video games, comic books, and all manner of geek culture subjects. According to their [about page](https://www.geek.com/about/), “Geek culture may be dominating pop culture, but no matter how many supercomputers everyday folks shove in their pockets while spending a billion dollars on comic book movies, the mainstream can never replace geekdom’s wonderfully weird heart.”
The current editor-in-chief is Dan Costa.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Geek.com almost exclusively covers technology, science, and entertainment news. These articles are typically low-biased and informative such as this:
[This Robot Groundskeeper Is Equal Parts Lawnmower and Snow Blower](https://www.geek.com/tech/this-robot-groundskeeper-is-equal-parts-lawnmower-and-snow-blower-1803235/). Science-related stories are usually well-sourced, such as this [one](https://www.geek.com/news/beijing-based-company-creates-chinas-first-cloned-kitten-1803300/), which is sourced to the [New York Times](https://www.geek.com/news/beijing-based-company-creates-chinas-first-cloned-kitten-1803300/) and [AFP](https://www.geek.com/news/beijing-based-company-creates-chinas-first-cloned-kitten-1803300/).
Geek.com rarely reports on political issues; however, when they do, it is related to their genre, such as this:
[Federal Court Rules Trump Can’t Block Haters on Twitter.](https://www.geek.com/tech/federal-court-rules-trump-cant-block-haters-on-twitter-1795104/) This story is sourced to Columbia University and the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) In general, this is a low-biased source that reports factually.
