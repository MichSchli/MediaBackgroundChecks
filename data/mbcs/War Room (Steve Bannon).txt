History
Launched in 2019, War Room is the podcast of conservative former Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon. The website warroom.org is the associated website that hosts the podcast and publishes news and opinion articles. According to their
[about page](https://warroom.org/about/), “War Room: Pandemic is a news site and podcast with former Trump campaign CEO and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon, former chief of staff to Nigel Farage, Raheem Kassam, and WarRoom’s own Jack Maxey.”
Bannon is also the founder of the conservative advocacy group called
[Citizens of the American Republic](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/823509136) and was a former [Breitbart News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) executive chairman. [In October 2022](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/stephen-k-bannon-sentenced-four-months-prison-two-counts-contempt-congress), Bannon was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress and sentenced to 4 months in prison. The indictment alleged that Bannon failed to comply with a subpoena from the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee seeking information about his role on the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Analysis / Bias
The War Room website publishes Bannon’s War Room podcast. The website also features text news and opinion articles by Bannon and others. Bannon’s podcast frequently promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience through questionable guests like
[Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/), [Peter Navarro](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/navarro-report/), [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), and [Naomi Wolfe](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/large-scale-studies-found-covid-19-vaccination-doesnt-increase-risk-negative-pregnancy-outcomes-contrary-to-claim-naomi-wolf/). All of these people have either [promoted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-says-phone-records-subpoenaed-by-house-jan-6-committee.html) unsubstantiated claims of election fraud in the 2020 election or pseudoscience related to [Covid-19 and vaccines](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-effectively-prevent-severe-disease-havent-shown-signs-of-antibody-dependent-enhancement-as-claimed-by-robert-malone/).
Editorially, all stories favor the extreme right, such as this
[Fauci’s Replacement Signed Deals Pushing Research Collaboration With Chinese Communist Party In Wuhan, Responsible For Secret Reversal Of Gain-of-Function Funding Ban.](https://warroom.org/2022/12/10/faucis-succcesor-spearheaded-collaboration-with-ccp-on-gof-research/) Others denigrate the left like this: [Biden’s Deceitful Open Border Plan Increases Legal Pathways For Title XIII Workarounds.](https://warroom.org/2022/12/14/bidens-deceitful-open-border-plan-increases-legal-pathways-for-title-xiii-workarounds/)
Further, almost every story reviewed either promotes conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, or disinformation, such as this
[Episode 845 – An Infinite Bioweapon … How the CCP Virus Weakened the Church and How to Fix It (w/ Maria Luisa, Brian McCall, Dr. Maria Ryan, Dr. Yan, Drew Mason)](https://warroom.org/2021/04/02/episode-845-an-infinite-bioweapon-how-the-ccp-virus-weakened-the-church-and-how-to-fix-it-w-maria-luisa-brian-mccall-dr-maria-ryan-dr-yan-drew-mason/) and this [Episode 1,232 – Exposing the Stolen Election](https://archive.ph/o2HAS#selection-589.0-589.44). There is [no evidence](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/05/facebook-posts/no-virus-causes-covid-19-not-patented-bioweapon/) that Covid is a bioweapon or that the [2020 election was stolen](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-courts-election-idUSKBN2AF1G1).
In general, Steve Bannon’s War Room is a vehicle to promote far-right disinformation propaganda as a means to sow division and create chaos. To put it in perspective, “War Room” is less credible than the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and rivals Infowars in its blatant promotion of disinformation.
