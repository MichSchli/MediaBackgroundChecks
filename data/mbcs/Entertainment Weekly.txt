Analysis / Bias
In review, Entertainment Weekly covers movies, television, and general entertainment with minimal bias, such as this:
[See the best â€™60s fashion from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.](https://ew.com/movies/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-fashion/) Headlines typically reflect the content of articles, and credible sources are used for reference. Editorially, EW does not directly cover politics; however, they do publish entertainment news as it relates to politics. For example, they often publish video clips of late-night TV hosts mocking politicians like this: [Trevor Noah and Jimmy Fallon perform dueling impressions of Trump smoking weed](https://ew.com/tv/2019/06/26/trevor-noah-jimmy-fallon-donald-trump-impressions-smoking-weed/). A thorough review of political content demonstrates a more negative tone toward the right-leaning politicians.
