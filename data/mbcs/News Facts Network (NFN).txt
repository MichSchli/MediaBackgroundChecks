Analysis / Bias
In review, News Facts Network (NFN) is a companion site to Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC). And in the interest of full disclosure, I have written site reviews for MBFC off and on for years. I have not done any work with or for NFN, however. And I approached this review as objectively as I would any other site I review. I read the content and articles, fact-checked them thoroughly, and verify what I find with independent sources I know to be credible. Then let the evidence determine my rating.
NFN provides a variety of articles and opinion pieces on current affairs, primarily political, from sources on both the left and the right. The linked sources I checked are all within the Right-Center, Least Biased, and Left-Center as rated on the MBFC’s site. All of which provide accurate, factual reporting with a minimum of bias. What I found is that NFN is as factual and accurate a site as any I’ve seen. Both in its source material and in the opinion pieces. On NFN’s “About” page they list their mission statement as follows: “The mission of News Facts Network is to curate and publish news stories that are certified factual and low biased.” In this, I believe they have succeeded. While some of the content may have a slight left or right bias, that is primarily determined by the source, not NFN. Finally, NFN’s painstaking fairness in presenting both sides is admirable, and not often seen.
