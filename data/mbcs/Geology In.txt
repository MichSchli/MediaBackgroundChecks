Analysis / Bias
In review, Geology In primarily aggregates geology news from other reputable science journals and magazines. Although the scientific information is generally credible, Geology In utilizes loaded sensational headlines such as this:
[Yellowstone Volcano Was Hit by Earthquake Swarm of 2,500 Tremors.](http://www.geologyin.com/2018/12/yellowstone-volcano-was-hit-by.html#KdR5kQUZvxvBFM9z.99) This particular story was summarized from credible [USGS](https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/article_home.html) information and used wording from a [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/yellowstone-supervolcano-earthquake-swarm-volcano-yellowstone-volcano-1255302) article. Generally, most stories follow the same format of summaries from other sources; sometimes, these stories are copied verbatim, though credit is given to the original source.
