Analysis / Bias
In review, TreeHugger has a left-leaning political bias based on their views of conservation and sustainability, however, this is a scientific website that sources to credible science. They just happen to focus on the importance of conservation. Articles and headlines use minimally loaded language such as this

Editorially, TreeHugger aligns with the left based on their advocacy for conservation and concern for climate change. When reporting on political issues, they present a negative point of view when covering the former Trump administration, such as this:
