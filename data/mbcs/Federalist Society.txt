History
Founded in 1982,
[The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Society), most frequently called the Federalist Society, is an organization of conservatives and libertarians seeking reform of the current American legal system in accordance with a textualist or originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. In January 2019, The Washington Post Magazine wrote that the Federalist Society had reached an “unprecedented peak of power and influence.” Of the nine members of the Supreme Court of the United States, six (Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Amy Coney Barrett) are [current or former members of the organization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). [The mission](https://fedsoc.org/about-us) of the Federalist Society is “It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Federalist Society’s main purpose is to ensure that conservative judges are appointed. The Federalist Society is opposed to so-called liberal public education, reproductive choice, labor regulations, and environmental laws and is highly pro-2nd amendment. The website has a
[blog](https://fedsoc.org/commentary/blog-posts) that covers these issues with a strong right-wing bias in reporting. There is moderate use of loaded words, and not all articles are sourced. They generally hold a right-conservative bias and promote activist judges who further their agenda.
