Analysis / Bias
Mexico Daily Post often republishes articles from other news sources, such as
[“Beware: A timeshare fraud network is run by Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion in Puerto Vallarta.”](https://mexicodailypost.com/2023/03/06/a-timeshare-fraud-network-is-run-by-cartel-jalisco-nueva-generacion-in-puerto-vallarta/) sometimes without significant changes. For example, the article [“El Chapo had same powers as a president: AMLO says,”](https://mexicodailypost.com/2020/01/02/el-chapo-had-same-powers-as-a-president-amlo-says/) published by Mexico Daily Post, is nearly identical to the article [“El Chapo had same powers as a president, Mexico’s leader says”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/el-chapo-president-power-joaquin-guzman-sinaloa-cartel-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-a9267241.html) from [The Independent.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/) Both articles present the same wording, structure, and sequence of information. While the Mexico Daily Post attributes [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) at the bottom, the extent of similarity suggests a direct replication of The Independent’s content. This heavy borrowing without significant rephrasing or original input indicates that the Mexico Daily Post article heavily borrowed or copied content from the Independent constituting plagiarism.
Another example of plagiarism occurs in the article
[Mexican government condemns the death of Mexican national Cristian Baltazar Torres](https://mexicodailypost.com/2023/04/19/mexican-government-condemns-the-death-of-mexican-national-cristian-baltazar-torres/) where they [copied a 100% match](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-excessive-force-us-police-shooting-f7444082ced06181db89edaa0e7f118c), including the headline from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). While they provide a crediting link to the AP as the source, the hyperlink leads back to the Mexico Daily Post’s homepage, never attributing it to the AP article. Throughout our review, we found numerous examples of copied work and misattributed content.
The Mexico Daily Post also tends to republish articles that are critical of right-wing figures and movements, such as
[“Tucker Carlson’s extremist recommendation to the Republicans: The US should bomb Mexico”](https://mexicodailypost.com/2023/07/18/tucker-carlsons-extremist-recommendation-to-the-republicans-the-us-should-bomb-mexico/) and “ [Donald Trump Jr. says it’s no big deal if his dad bombs Mexico,](https://mexicodailypost.com/2022/05/07/donald-trump-jr-says-its-no-big-deal-if-his-dad-bombs-mexico/)” indicating a left-leaning political bias. In general, this website is an imposter website that is designed to look like a credible news site.
