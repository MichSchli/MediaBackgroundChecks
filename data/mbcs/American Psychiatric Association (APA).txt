Analysis / Bias
The American Psychiatric Association website publishes news and information for a general audience under the
[Patients and Families](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families) tab, which lists mental conditions in alphabetic order. The website also publishes news releases about the association and a blog with stories like [Decriminalizing Mental Illness and Promoting Mental Health Equity](https://www.psychiatry.org/News-room/APA-Blogs/Decriminalizing-Mental-Illness). All information is credibly sourced to organizations such as the [Centers for Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.psychiatry.org/News-room/APA-Blogs/Decriminalizing-Mental-Illness) and peer-reviewed journals.
Editorially, the website prominently advocates for the
[Goldwater Rule](https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/goldwater-rule), which is a 1973 directive that urges psychiatrists to show restraint when asked to assess the mental fitness of political candidates. Although the APA does not directly assess former President Trump’s psychological status, they do report negatively on his policy [APA Expresses Concern About the Trump Administration Executive Order Regarding Diversity and Inclusion Training by Federal Agencies](https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/apa-expresses-concern-about-the-trump-administrati). On the other hand, they report favorably on the Biden Administration [APA Congratulates President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President- Elect Kamala Harris; Pledges to Work with Them on Advancing Mental Health](https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/apa-congratulates-president-elect-joe-biden-and-vi).
The APA generally publishes fact-based content that aligns with the political left in the United States.
