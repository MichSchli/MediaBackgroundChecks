Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the content of Waking Times I found several articles that would fall under both the Pseudoscience and Conspiracy categories. For example, in this
[anti-vaccination article](http://wakingtimesmedia.com/far-vaccine-damaged-children-america-chemical-weapons-damaged-children-syria/), they use fear to persuade people [not to vaccinate their children](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/). The article attempts to convince people that more children are vaccine damaged in the USA than children in Syria have been damaged by chemical weapons. This article provides zero evidence to support that more children are injured by vaccines. There is not a single statistic from a reliable source to support this claim. They do, however, claim that the Syrian bombing by the USA was a False flag operation. In fact, the article cites Natural News as the primary source of information. [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) is a well-known purveyor of pseudoscience, conspiracies, and fake news. Within this same article they cite a source called [CDC.news](http://cdc.news), which is meant to look like an official CDC page, but in fact, is owned by Natural News for the purpose of discrediting the CDC. At least they put a disclaimer on the CDC.news page that it is not affiliated with the credible [Centers for Disease Control.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/)
