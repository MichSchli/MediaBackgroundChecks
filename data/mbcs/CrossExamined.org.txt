Analysis / Bias
The article
[“Christians, Donald Trump, and the Meeting”](https://crossexamined.org/christians-donald-trump-meeting/) by Frank Turek argues that Christians should support [Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) based on the idea that Trump’s policies align with Christian values. The article cites sources such as [Priests for Life](https://www.priestsforlife.org/), a now-removed YouTube video, and an unrelated site, [ADF Media](https://adfmedia.org/search?search_term=). The author, Frank Turek, is a Christian apologist who uses religious context to advocate for political support, which could be seen as biased and not objective.
Another article,
[“5 Reasons the Resurrection of Jesus Is Not a Copy of Ancient Pagan Myths,”](https://crossexamined.org/5-reasons-the-resurrection-of-jesus-is-not-a-copy-of-ancient-pagan-myths/) aims to debunk the idea that Jesus’ resurrection is borrowed from ancient myths. The article is written from a Christian apologetic perspective and cites ancient texts and myths to support its arguments. It’s important to note that the resurrection of Jesus is a matter of faith and religious belief. There is no scientific evidence to prove or disprove the resurrection, making it a topic that is inherently difficult to analyze through a purely factual lens. The article operates within the framework of Christian apologetics and aims to defend a religious belief rather than provide empirical evidence.
In addition, CrossExamined.org often delves into scientific topics like evolution but approaches them from a faith-based perspective, which can be considered pseudoscience. For example, the article
[“Intelligent Design & Evolution”](https://crossexamined.org/intelligent-design-evolution/) argues against the scientific theory of evolution and attempts to provide a religious explanation for the origin of life. This mixing of religious beliefs with scientific topics can be misleading.
Finally, the website also features an article that suggests it is against same-sex marriage, advocating for a traditional Christian view. The article
[“How to Speak the Truth on Same-Sex Marriage (Even If the World Hates You For It)”](https://crossexamined.org/how-to-speak-the-truth-on-same-sex-marriage-even-if-the-world-hates-you-for-it/) discusses the stance of the Christian church on same-sex marriage and suggests that if same-sex marriage is allowed, it could lead to the endorsement of other sexual proclivities by the church. In general, CrossExamined promotes unproven and scientifically unsubstantiated claims.
