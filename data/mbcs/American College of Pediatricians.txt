History
[Founded in 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Pediatricians), The American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) is an advocacy group of pediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the United States. The group was founded by a group of pediatricians, including Joseph Zanga, a past president of the [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-academy-of-pediatrics/), as a protest against the AAP’s support for adoption by gay couples. The group’s membership as of 2016 is estimated at 500 members, in contrast to the AAP’s of over 60,000 members. The organization’s view on parenting is at odds with the American Academy of Pediatrics, which holds that sexual orientation does not correlate with the ability to be a good parent and raise healthy and well-adjusted children. The Southern Poverty Law Center has described the American College of Pediatricians as a “ [hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/american-college-pediatricians-defames-gays-and-lesbians-name-protecting-children)” with “a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about LGBT people.”
According to their
[about page](https://www.acpeds.org/about-us), “The Mission of the American College of Pediatricians is to enable all children to reach their optimal physical and emotional health and well-being. To this end, we recognize the basic father-mother family unit, within the context of marriage, to be the optimal setting for childhood development, but pledge our support to all children, regardless of their circumstances.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The American College of Pediatricians is not a credible organization that routinely publishes
[anti-LGBT information](https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/parenting-issues/defending-traditional-marriage?highlight=gay%20marriage) and [anti-Vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this: [Human Papillomavirus Vaccination](https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/health-issues/human-papilloma-virus-vaccination?highlight=vaccination) and this [College Opposes Mandatory Humanpapilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccination](https://www.acpeds.org/college-opposes-mandatory-humanpapilloma-virus-hpv-vaccination). Regarding LGBTQ, the Southern Poverty Law Center has written this: [AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PEDIATRICIANS DEFAMES GAYS AND LESBIANS IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING CHILDREN](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/american-college-pediatricians-defames-gays-and-lesbians-name-protecting-children).
[Psychology Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/psychology-today/) has written this: [The American College of Pediatricians Is an Anti-LGBT Group.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/201705/the-american-college-pediatricians-is-anti-lgbt-group) While Media Bias Fact Check does not determine Hate Group status, we rely on 3rd party experts and pro-science sources, which have both proclaimed the American College of Pediatricians a Hate Group.
