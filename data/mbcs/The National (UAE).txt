Analysis / Bias
In 2022,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked United Arab Emirates (UAE) 138/180 in their [Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/united-arab-emirates), stating that “the authorities can censor local or foreign publications if they criticize domestic policies, the economy, the ruling families, religion or the UAE’s relations with its allies.” Abu Dhabi’s ruler and UAE President is [Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.](https://www.cpc.gov.ae/en-us/thepresident/Pages/president.aspx) [Read our detailed profile on UAE’s government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-arab-emirates-media-profile/)
In review, The National publishes articles with headlines that have strong, emotionally loaded language when covering rival countries, such as
[“Turkey’s imperialist streak masks its inner turmoil](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/editorial/turkey-s-imperialist-streak-masks-its-inner-turmoil-1.1033964),” [“Why Europe should practise social distancing with Turkey,”](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/why-europe-should-practise-social-distancing-with-turkey-1.993363) and [“Iran’s ‘amazing’ Covid-19 detectors identified as re-purposed fake bomb scanners”.](https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/iran-s-amazing-covid-19-detectors-identified-as-re-purposed-fake-bomb-scanners-1.1006918)
The National does not criticize and mostly focuses on positive coverage of the country’s ruling families, such as
[“Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid turns 70: A look back at his life”](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-turns-70-a-look-back-at-his-life-1.886195) and [“Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid tours Dubai’s Fish Farm.”](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/environment/sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-tours-dubai-s-fish-farm-1.1037897) The National also reports selectively when the issue doesn’t resonate with the Ruler. For example, news related to his wife, where The New York Times reports [“Princess Haya, Wife of Dubai’s Ruler, Seeks Protective Order”](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/world/middleeast/princess-haya-dubai-protective-order.html); however, The National does not report this or any other news related to her after the divorce. Prior to the divorce, they covered her regularly with positive stories such as [“Princess Haya’s biscuit fund: how a simple packet can save a child’s life](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/princess-haya-s-biscuit-fund-how-a-simple-packet-can-save-a-child-s-life-1.697978).” The National often sources through quotes and utilizes Emirates News Agency (WAM) which is the official news agency of the United Arab Emirates. They also republish [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) news stories. When covering world news about the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a negative tone [“Trump rally disappoints with small crowd in Tulsa.”](https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/trump-rally-disappoints-with-small-crowd-in-tulsa-1.1036542) In general, this is a source that promotes pro-State propaganda and poorly sources information.
