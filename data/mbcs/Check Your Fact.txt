Analysis / Bias
In review, CYF tends to select fact checks more favorable to the Right. For example, they are more likely to select a True statement by a Republican and a False statement by a Democrat. This conveys a right-leaning bias but does not diminish the quality and veracity of the fact check.
CYF uses appropriate neutral language in headlines and articles such as this:
[FACT CHECK: DOES THE DEATH TAX ONLY APPLY TO ESTATES WORTH MORE THAN $11 MILLION?](http://checkyourfact.com/2017/09/29/fact-check-does-the-death-tax-only-apply-to-estates-worth-more-than-11-million/). Like all credible fact-checkers, they utilize proper sources and experts within the field to validate the claim they are fact-checking. In general, they are reliable fact-checker that favors the right but produces accurate fact-checking.
