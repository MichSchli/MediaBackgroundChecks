Analysis / Bias
[Study Finds](https://studyfinds.org/mission/) “publishes digestible, summarized versions of research that are intended to stir debate: We do not agree nor disagree with any of the studies we post; rather, we encourage our readers to debate the veracity of the findings themselves.”
The website creates YouTube videos that are published on its
[SFTV page](https://studyfinds.org/sftv/). They also publish research and articles in the categories of family, health, science, society, politics, business news, and weird.
Headlines of articles often use moderately loaded language to hook the reader, such as this
[Astronomers spot the largest potentially hazardous asteroid hiding near Earth in 8 years](https://studyfinds.org/largest-asteroid-in-8-years/). This news summary is sourced from the credible [Astronomical Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac8cff).
News summaries are typically derived from firsthand interviews and expert opinions from researchers as well summarized peer-reviewed studies. Most articles are sourced from credible outlets such as The European Journal of Nutrition,
[The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/), and the American Journal of Public Health.
The website also publishes research and news related to politics that uses eye-catching headlines such as this
[Can’t we all just get along? 4 in 5 Americans would put aside differences for common causes](https://studyfinds.org/americans-differences-common-cause/). However, the article’s content is low-biased and factual and sourced from credible polling researchers. Study Finds does not publish opinion content; therefore, they are least biased and highly factual.
