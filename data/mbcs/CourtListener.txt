Analysis / Bias
CourtListener offers a comprehensive database of legal opinions and court documents and user-friendly tools for searching and analyzing these materials. The platform’s advanced search options and citation visualizations enhance the research experience for legal professionals, journalists, academics, and the general public.
One notable feature is the
[SCOTUS Mapper](https://www.courtlistener.com/visualizations/scotus-mapper/), which allows users to visualize connections among Supreme Court cases. While CourtListener is generally free, the “Make a Network” feature requires users to sign in to their CourtListener accounts. Additionally, the platform hosts the [RECAP Archive](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/), which aggregates [documents](https://free.law/2017/08/15/we-have-all-free-pacer) from the PACER (The Public Access to Court Electronic Records) system, offering an alternative to the fee-based access provided by [PACER](https://pacer.uscourts.gov/help/faqs/top-faqs) itself.
CourtListener maintains a neutral stance, avoiding editorialization or endorsement of specific viewpoints in its presentation of legal information. Its content is factual, well-organized, and consistently updated. In addition, both
[ProPublica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/propublica/), a nonprofit newsroom with a left-center bias, and [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), rated right-center biased by MBFC, have incorporated [CourtListener’s data](https://free.law/2023/12/21/proppublica-builds-on-our-data) into their reporting on judicial conflicts. Therefore, CourtListener demonstrates minimal bias and is fact-based.
