Analysis / Bias
In review, The Maui News produces original reporting covering the islands of Maui, Lanai, and Molokai in Hawaii. Headlines and articles contain minimal emotional language:
[Lanai residents to test the COVID-19 app](https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2020/11/lanai-residents-to-test-covid-19-app/). National and international news is republished from the [Associated Press.](https://www.post-journal.com/news/local-news/2019/10/police-investigating-saturday-stabbing/)
Editorially, the paper does not endorse Presidential candidates. A review of editorial commentary shows a reasonable balance between right and left without delving into extremes; however, slightly more op-eds favor the left, such as this, which is critical of the GOP:
[Courts have been packed](https://www.mauinews.com/opinion/editorial/2020/10/courts-have-been-packed/), and this [GOP should follow its rule](https://www.mauinews.com/opinion/editorial/2020/09/gop-should-follow-its-rule/). The news is generally reported factually with a slight liberal bias editorially.
