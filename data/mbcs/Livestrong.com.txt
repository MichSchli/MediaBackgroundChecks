History
Founded in 2008, Livestrong.com is a health, fitness, and lifestyle website that is in partnership with the Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF), Livestrong (
[Livestrong.org](https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2009/08100/Livestrong.org)) as they state: “We are a proud licensing partner of the LIVESTRONG Foundation and have contributed over $3M in support of their mission to provide services to those affected by cancer.” There is [controversy](https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2009/08100/Livestrong_com_vs_Livestrong_org__Does_Same_Name.7.aspx) about using a similar domain name that utilizes LAF’s legitimate cancer foundation and a website that promotes questionable homeopathic cancer advice.

Analysis / Bias
According to their about page: “LIVESTRONG.COM provides the blueprint to simple healthy living. Our mission is to empower anyone at any age or stage in their fitness journey with the information and tools that will help them to make better choices – even just one small better choice can motivate them and improve their potential to truly thrive.”
In review, Livestrong.com does provide sound dietary advice that is rooted in science. They also have developed
[MyPlate](https://www.livestrong.com/myplate/), which shows a color-coded way to balance meals with protein, carbs, fats, etc. This is good information and used by millions. It is helpful. However, they also promote pseudoscience and junk science such as [Psyllium Husk & Bentonite Clay for Weight Loss](http://www.livestrong.com/article/343091-psyllium-husk-bentonite-clay-for-weight-loss/#ixzz1xhywHom5) in which there is zero scientific evidence. Further, [some sources](https://www.salon.com/2013/11/20/livestrongs_cancerhacks_hashtag_delivers_terrible_advice/) have accused them of endorsing [natural cures for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) or prevention that is dangerous to overall health.
Failed Fact Checks
- A
[factual search](https://factualsearch.news/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=livestrong&gsc.sort=&gsc.ref=fact_checking)reveals that LiveStrong.com has not failed a fact check, likely because pseudoscience sites do not get fact-checked often. The bottom line is most of the information on Livestrong.com is factual and trustworthy, but some dips into the pseudoscience realm.
