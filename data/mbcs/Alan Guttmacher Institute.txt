Funded by / Ownership
The Institute was first started in
[1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttmacher_Institute) as part of Planned Parenthood, with its funding being solely from Planned Parenthood. Once the Guttmacher Institute was no longer connected to Planned Parenthood in 2007, the organization only received less than 1% of its funding from Planned Parenthood in 2010. Now, most of the funding is gained through private foundations based in the United States. Other funding does come from international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank. Over the last 25 years, the [MacArthur Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Foundation), along with Planned Parenthood’s contribution of well over $2 million, has provided funding so that the Guttmacher Institute can conduct studies internationally on women’s abortion rates and reproductive health.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Guttmacher Institute exclusively reports on and advocates for reproductive rights. There is little use of loaded language such as this:
[Ensuring Access to Abortion at the State Level: Selected Examples and Lessons](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2019/01/ensuring-access-abortion-state-level-selected-examples-and-lessons). This research is very well sourced from credible sources and information. In general, all information on this website points toward advocacy for abortion and contraception rights. Although this strongly aligns with the political left, the Guttmacher Institute, according to the [least biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/) [Factcheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/factcheck-mailbag-week-of-april-6-april-12/), “provides the most highly respected statistics on the sexual health of women and men. Its figures on abortion are widely cited by the media as well as by groups on both sides of the political aisle.”
