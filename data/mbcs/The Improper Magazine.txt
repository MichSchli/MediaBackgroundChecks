Analysis / Bias
In review, TheImproper primary reports on entertainment and culture about New York City. They also occasionally report political news with a strong left-leaning bias such as this article:
[Tucker Carlson Scolded By Journalist Brit Hume for Hate Mongering (See!).](https://www.theimproper.com/158213/tucker-carlson-scolded-journalist-brit-hume-hate-mongering-see/) This particular article does not contain linked sourcing, however, it is an opinion piece centering around a video clip, which they provide and therefore does not require it. In another piece highly critical of the right, ( [Brett Kavanaugh History of Lying, Zealotry, Hypocrisy Disqualifies Him for High Court](https://www.theimproper.com/158172/brett-kavanaugh-history-lying-political-zealotry-hypocrisy-disqualify-him-for-high-court/)) there is significant use of loaded language denigrating Brett Kavanaugh and the right in general, however, the information is properly sourced to court documents and other credible media outlets.
