Analysis / Bias
In review,
[NeuroNation](https://sp.neuronation.com/en/#courses) utilizes courses that they purport to increase memory and concentration. They further claim that the courses are being used successfully in Alzheimer’s prevention as well as for stress and burnout prevention in corporate health management. While brain games and training may increase performance through repetition, [there isn’t any](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/does-brain-training-work/) current [scientific evidence](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100616661983?journalCode=psia) to back the claims made by NeuroNation.
