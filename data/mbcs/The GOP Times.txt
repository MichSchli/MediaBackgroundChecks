History
[Launched in 2020](https://whois.domaintools.com/thegoptimes.com), The GOP Times is a conservative news commentary website by [Sandy Ravage](https://thegoptimes.com/author/chris/) (not the real name), who is listed as the site admin. The website otherwise lacks transparency as they do not have an about page, provide author bios, or name ownership.

Analysis / Bias
The GOP Times does not produce original news content; instead, they rely on the reporting of other sources and add conservative commentary. Articles and headlines frequently contain loaded emotional wording such as this
[GOP DEVASTATED… Eternally Red Seat in DANGER](https://thegoptimes.com/gop-devastated-eternally-red-seat-in-danger/), and this [Senator Rand Paul OUTRAGES Democrats… REPEAL IT NOW!](https://thegoptimes.com/senator-rand-paul-outrages-democrats-repeal-it-now/)
The website relies on credible sources such as
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) and Questionable sources like [The Blaze](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-blaze/), [Just the News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). The Gateway Pundit is one the least credible sources on the internet, failing fact checks on a near daily basis.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and usually denigrate the left, such as this
[Democrats Destroy Working Families As They Run For Federal Office](https://thegoptimes.com/democrats-destroy-working-families-as-they-run-for-federal-office/). They also report favorably on former President Trump, such as this [Trump Is Handed Another Win](https://thegoptimes.com/trump-is-handed-another-win/). Further, after the 2020 Presidential Election, they promoted election fraud conspiracies such as this [Breaking news: 700k STOLEN Votes, Trump Win Coming in HOT](https://thegoptimes.com/breaking-news-700k-stolen-votes-trump-win-coming-in-hot/). According to conservative fact-checker [Check Your Fact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/check-your-fact/), this is [false](https://checkyourfact.com/2021/11/05/fact-check-maricopa-audit-find-700000-trump-votes/).
Finally, the website promotes Covid-19 vaccine misinformation (pseudoscience). For example, in this piece,
[The TRUE Number Of Vaccine Injuries Will Make You See Red!](https://thegoptimes.com/the-true-number-of-vaccine-injuries-will-make-you-see-red-2/) they rely on VAERS for information. The VAERS website [disclaims](https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html) that “anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS” and that content is not vetted before being made public; therefore, there is likely a significant amount of misinformation published. We also highly recommend this article [Understanding causality in adverse events after vaccination](https://healthfeedback.org/understanding-causality-in-adverse-events-after-vaccination/) to understand why VAERS does not prove causality and why the numbers should not be taken literally. In general, The GOP Times is Far Right biased and sometimes promotes misinformation.
