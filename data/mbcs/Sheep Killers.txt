History
Founded in 2009, Sheep Killers is an over-the-top conspiracy and pseudoscience website. There isn’t an about page or any names mentioned with the website, but it appears to be a hybrid of biblical literalism and conspiracy theories all mashed together. Their home page reads: “The Bible says that Israel was constantly being led astray by bad leaders. Well, like them, Americans have also have been led astray by bad leadership. Our leaders perfectly fit the description of Israel’s leaders given in
[Ezekiel chapter 34.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2034;&version=51;) The [New World Order](http://www.sheepkillers.com/thenewworldorder.html) and our government (if indeed there is a difference) are counting on the fact that most people are really sheep. We are ignorant and easily led – and in many cases, [we even finance and bring about our own destruction](http://www.sheepkillers.com/thefederalreserve.html)! In an effort to wake people up to the many realities that could easily point to our doom, this website is being designed to expose the [Global Elite’s agenda](http://www.sheepkillers.com/thenewworldorder.html) for stripping you of your rights, your money, your property, your privacy and ultimately for the total [depopulation of the earth down to a number (500 million)](http://www.sheepkillers.com/georgiaguidestones.html) that can easily be controlled to do their bidding. That may sound crazy at first glance. Once, we thought so too. Until our eyes were opened.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, where to start? This website covers every conspiracy and quacked pseudoscience story imaginable. They cover
[9-11 as a false flag](http://www.sheepkillers.com/the911conspiracy.html), [Chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/) as a government means to mind control, the [New World Order](http://www.sheepkillers.com/thenewworldorder.html), and of course, [Obama is a Muslim,](http://www.sheepkillers.com/thenewworldorder.html) which sources the very questionable extreme right [WND](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-net-daily-wnd/), which is a fake right-wing news source.
In general, this is one of the craziest conspiracy sites on the internet.
Overall, Sheep Killers is an absolute Tin-Foil Hat and Quackery website. Literally, nothing is proven on this website. I say this seriously,
