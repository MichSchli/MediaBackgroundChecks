History
Founded in 2017,
[Le Média](https://www.lemediatv.fr/annexes/manifeste) is a news/web television platform focusing on investigative journalism and in-depth analysis, often covering social justice, environmental issues, and global inequities. Le Média was launched to provide an alternative media voice closely aligned with the left-wing political movement France Insoumise. Co-founded by key figures including [Sophia Chikirou](https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/le-media-linvraisemblable-feuilleton-qui-agite-la-chaine-proche-des-insoumis-en-4-episodes-1303828), Gérard Miller, and Henri Poulain, the platform sought to embody the ideological tenets of [France Insoumise](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/whose-populism-mixed-messages-france-insoumise-melenchon-left/) (populist Left Party), reflecting its broader political ambitions and objectives. The involvement of Chikirou, who has a significant background in political communications and strategy within France Insoumise, indicates the channel’s deep political connections with left-wing politics.

Analysis / Bias
The articles from Le Média exhibit a distinctly progressive, left-leaning perspective, emphasizing themes such as social justice, environmental sustainability, and critiques of capitalist frameworks. For instance, the article
[“Repression and Crimes against migrants: how Europe Finances the Horror”](https://www.lemediatv.fr/articles/2022/repression-et-crimes-contre-les-migrants-comment-leurope-finance-lhorreur-ANOhlo9fSZmmgmPiHJVezQ) critiques Europe’s migration policies and their outsourcing of border control, highlighting a perceived lack of empathy and responsibility towards migrants.
Another piece,
[“Spying on Journalists: France Stands Together Alongside Six European States,”](https://www.lemediatv.fr/articles/2023/espionnage-des-journalistes-la-france-fait-bloc-aux-cotes-de-six-etats-europeens-ube8AubrSUuWremXwq8VHw) criticizes the French government’s surveillance policies concerning journalists, describing the government’s intentions as having “repressive aims against the press” and accusing it of “actively campaigning to allow surveillance of journalists, in the name of ‘national security.'”
Le Média uses official sources such as the
[European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en) and the [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en) and references specific [documents](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24214069/compte-rendu-dune-reunion-du-conseil-de-lue-du-22-novembre-2023-emfa.pdf) to support its claims about various governments’ stances on journalist surveillance. However, the credibility of these sources is difficult to assess.
In addition to articles, Le Média produces content like the
[“Critical Symptoms”](https://www.lemediatv.fr/emissions/2021/psychotrauma-indemnisation-la-double-peine-des-victimes-dattentats-O6W5RqoJTHuJ6j-4FUm1ug) show on societal issues, including mental health. However, the lack of explicit sourcing makes evaluating the content’s accuracy and reliability difficult without scientific or expert references. While the show’s accompanying text offers insights into the challenges faced by individuals with these disorders and mentions significant statistics, it fails to cite specific sources for the data or claims made.
In general, Le Media strongly favors the left and is reasonably fact-based.
