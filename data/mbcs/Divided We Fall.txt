Analysis / Bias
An article on the
[recent indictment of former President Donald Trump](https://dividedwefall.org/trump-indictment-debate/) presents two contrasting viewpoints, one arguing that the indictment is politically motivated and the other contending that it is rooted in the rule of law. The article cites multiple sources, including [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [PBS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pbs/), [NY Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/) (Mixed), [Daily Mail UK](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) (Questionable), [manhattanda.org](https://www.manhattanda.org/), [AP News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/), which range from left-center to right-biased.
A second article, focusing on
[“AI in Arts and Entertainment,”](https://dividedwefall.org/ai-in-arts-and-entertainment/) takes a neutral stance, discussing the pros and cons of AI in creative fields. The article is well-researched and cites reputable sources like [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/). Furthermore, it’s worth noting that Divided We Fall also tackles highly controversial topics like abortion.
In their article
[“The Abortion Debate: Can We Find Common Ground?”](https://dividedwefall.org/the-abortion-debate-can-we-find-common-ground/), the site presents a balanced debate between pro-choice and pro-life camps. However, it’s noteworthy that the pro-life debater cites a source from Quillette, rated as [Questionable/Mixed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quillette/) by Media Bias/Fact Check. This inclusion suggests a variance in source credibility, even as the article aims for a balanced presentation of views. In general, Divided We Fall is categorized as least biased based on presenting a variety of perspectives representing both sides.
Failed Fact Checks
