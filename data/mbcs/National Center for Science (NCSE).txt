Analysis / Bias
In review, the National Center for Science Education is considered the United States’
[“leading anti-creationist organization](https://books.google.com/books?id=vg2XaexW62wC&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false).” The purpose of the organization is to promote science in classrooms through the support of teachers and the provision of resources. The website also publishes news that favors science, such as this [New antiscience legislation in Oklahoma](https://ncse.ngo/new-antiscience-legislation-oklahoma) and this [Resolution to support climate change education introduced in Congress](https://ncse.ngo/resolution-support-climate-change-education-introduced-congress-0). While these issues tend to align with the left, they also align with the consensus of science.
