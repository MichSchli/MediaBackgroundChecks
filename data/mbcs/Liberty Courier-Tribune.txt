Analysis / Bias
The Liberty Courier-Tribune website publishes news for the greater Liberty, Missouri area. Local news features original reporting with minimal bias, such as this:
[Chris Lonsdale becomes Missouri House rep for District 38](https://www.mycouriertribune.com/news/election_news/chris-lonsdale-becomes-missouri-house-rep-for-district-38/article_43c64802-12e6-11ed-872c-e3deb795acad.html). The [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and other large, credible media outlets cover national and international news.
Editorially, they produce op-eds under the Voices tag with a reasonable balance of opinions; however, more favor the right such as this
[Biden Administration needs to help slow inflation](https://www.mycouriertribune.com/opinion/community_voices/biden-administration-needs-to-help-slow-inflation/article_b2fb760c-082d-11ed-9260-470d803ef1b3.html). In general, they report news factually and with a slight right-leaning bias.
