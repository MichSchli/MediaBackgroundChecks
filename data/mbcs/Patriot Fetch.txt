History
[Founded in January 2021](https://whois.domaintools.com/patriotfetch.com), Patriot Fetch is an anonymously published conservative news and opinion website. The website lacks transparency as they do not name owners, editors, or provide an about page. However, at the bottom of some pages, they disclaim, “Calling All Americans! Patriot Fetch is Conservative Breaking News Headlines every day, all day.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
Patriot Fetch does not disclose ownership; however, with a bit of digging, we were able to discover who owns them. On the website’s
[contact page](https://patriotfetch.com/contact/), they list their email as @ILoveMyFreedom.org, an online store that sells conservative-themed merchandise. [I Love My Freedom](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/i-love-my-freedom/) is also a far-right questionable website owned by [Making Web LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/making-web-llc/). Making Web LLC also owns the questionable [Trending Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trending-politics/) website. Therefore, we conclude that Making Web LLC holds or is affiliated with Patriot Fetch. Advertising and a store that sells conservative-themed merchandise generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
Patriot Fetch publishes original reporting and republished content from other sources such as Trending Politics. Most articles reviewed derive from poor sources that hold far-right viewpoints and often promote misinformation, such as My Patriot Post,
[Right Scoop](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-right-scoop/), and the [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/). Original reporting is often highly biased using loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this [WOKE students and employees at ASU, and Levi Strauss are troubled by Rittenhouse verdict, demand he be expelled](https://patriotfetch.com/2021/11/woke-students-and-employees-at-asu-and-levi-strauss-are-troubled-by-rittenhouse-verdict-demand-he-be-expelled/).
The opening quote of the article is loaded with emotional wording favoring the right “The far left has been freaking out ever since Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges on November 19th, stemming from the Kenosha riots in which the 17-year-old teen at the time was forced to defend himself against a marauding mob of thugs, fatally shooting two and wounding one on the evening of August 25th, 2020.”
Editorially, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left. We found examples of Patriot Fetch promoting unfounded conspiracies such as this
[SAY HIS NAME! Another Clinton Connection Found DEAD](https://patriotfetch.com/2021/06/reporter-who-broke-clinton-lynch-tarmac-story-found-dead/). This story implies the [Clinton Body Count conspiracy](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/27/viral-image/no-evidence-support-clinton-body-count-hoax/) in which some claim the Clinton’s routinely murder people to cover up their secrets. Another article claims that [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left/cnn-bias/) ran a headline that said the vaccine would make you immortal [Very Real CNN Headline Argues Getting Vaccine Will Basically Make You Immortal](https://patriotfetch.com/2021/10/very-real-cnn-headline-argues-getting-vaccine-will-basically-make-you-immortal/?utm_source=880hpy). As proof, they linked to a Twitter account that removed the fake headline. Patriot Fetch holds a far-right editorial bias and often promotes misinformation.
