History
The Gnews.org domain was
[registered in 2012](http://whois.domaintools.com/gnews.org), with little other information about this website provided. The website does not have an about page, and links to their contact and disclaimer pages do not work. The two prominent names associated with the website are [Miles Guo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo_Wengui) (Guo Wengui), a Chinese Billionaire who controls Beijing Zenith Holdings. After falling out with the Communist Party leadership members, Guo was “accused of corruption and other misdeeds and forced to flee China. He fled to the United States in late 2014 after learning he was going to be [arrested](https://www.metro.us/president-trump/trump-changes-mind-guo-wengui-mar-a-lago) after allegations against him including bribing, kidnapping, money laundering, fraud, and rape.” The other prominent name is Alt-Right figure [Steve Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon), who served as an adviser to USA President Donald Trump and previously ran the questionable Alt-Right website, [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
The website promotes conspiracy theories and anti-communist propaganda.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Gnews publishes news and opinions with frequent use of emotionally loaded wording such as this:
[Miles Guo explains why CCP unleashed Wuhan coronavirus](https://gnews.org/107513/). In fact, most stories on the website currently point to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as the creator of the Coronavirus. Steve Bannon provides a videocast that often makes outrageous claims such as this: [Bannon’s War Room: 1.47 billion people will be infected by April, May](https://gnews.org/95382/). The website also provides world news that presents a very positive view of President Trump, such as this: [VINDICATED! President Trump acquitted from impeachment HOAX](https://gnews.org/104099/). This story, like most uses poor sources.
Failed Fact Checks
[Says the Chinese Communist Party “will finally admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from ‘a lab in Wuhan’ linked to its covert biological weapon programs.”](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/28/blog-posting/no-evidence-chinese-officials-will-say-coronavirus/)– FALSE [Coronavirus patients are being “cremated alive” in China.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/26/facebook-posts/chinese-billionaire-floats-conspiracy-about-corona/)– FALSE [The U.S. has threatened to get Italy out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which it partially relies upon for defense if it uses 5G technology.](https://misbar.com/en/factcheck/2020/09/05/u-s-didnt-threaten-to-kick-italy-out-of-nato-for-using-5g)– Fake [A mathematical principle known as “Benford’s Law” proves that Joe Biden’s votes were impossibly distributed and are therefore fraudulent.](https://www.truthorfiction.com/does-benfords-law-prove-election-fraud-in-biden-votes/)– False
They have also produced an unverified document that promotes the
[conspiracy](https://gnews.org/89737/) that the Chinese military spread the disease deliberately. In general, Steve Bannon and Miles Guo each rail against the Chinese Communist Party through conspiracy theories and unsourced propaganda. Politically, this source aligns strongly with the right through their rejection of communism.
