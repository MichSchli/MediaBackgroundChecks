History
Conservative Revival is a strong right-leaning news and opinion website. According to its
[about page](https://conservativerevival.com/about/) “Some days it feels like liberal ideas are the only things being promoted and celebrated. Conservative values… what are those? Where have they gone? And how do we make them popular again?” There aren’t any names associated with the website.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Conservative Revival publishes news and opinions with an extreme right-wing bias. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left by using loaded emotional wording such as this:
[Donald Trump Was Grinning From Ear to Ear When He Learned of This Supreme Court Victory](https://conservativerevival.com/latest-news/donald-trump-was-grinning-from-ear-to-ear-when-he-learned-of-this-supreme-court-victory/). The article itself also contains significant loaded quotes such as this: “Liberals waged total war against Trump during his four years in office and one of the ugliest episodes came when Democrats and the fake news media conspired to try and destroy Brett Kavanaugh with false allegations of sexual assault from back when Kavanaugh was in high school.”
Another example of highly loaded wording is
[Ron DeSantis Proved a Simple Truth That Will Wreck Democrats In November](https://conservativerevival.com/latest-news/ron-desantis-proved-a-simple-truth-that-will-wreck-democrats-in-november/). Like most on the website, this story does not provide hyperlinked sourcing.
Finally, Conservative Revival promotes conspiracy theories such as those from
[Tucker Carlson](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/). In general, this is an extremely right-biased propaganda website.
