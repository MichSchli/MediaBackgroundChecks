Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features selected science news stories and op-eds from various news publications in addition to commentary from its own contributors. Though their own political views lean conservative, the site’s founders say their goal is to give readers “ideological diversity” in its commentary section. In reviewing their political news and opinions there are slightly more that is published from right-leaning sources; however, both sides are represented.
Most of the news content on Real Clear Science is aggregated from other sources such as
[BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), [Ars Technica](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ars-technica/), and [Nature](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nature/). However, most [RCS content](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2020/07/07/breaking_down_human_consciousness.html) is derived from pro-science sources.
