Analysis / Bias
Eurasianet maintains a critical perspective toward regional governments, as seen in its articles about
[Turkmenistan’s leadership](https://eurasianet.org/turkmenistan-father-and-son) and [Azerbaijan’s environmental protests](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijani-president-makes-first-remarks-about-blockaded-village). The [Turkmenistan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/turkmenistan-government-and-media-profile/) article, using emotionally loaded language, describes a “farcical intra-generational tussle” and asserts Gurbanguly “stole his son’s limelight,” citing sources like the IMF for economic context and [turkmenistan.gov.tm](https://turkmenistan.gov.tm/ru/post/75526/geroj-arkadag-nagrazhdyon-pochyotnym-znakom-glav-gosudarstv-centralnoj-azii) to contrast its commentary with official narratives.
The
[Azerbaijan](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/azerbaijan-government-and-media-profile/) article titled [“Azerbaijani President Makes First Remarks about Blockaded Village”](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijani-president-makes-first-remarks-about-blockaded-village) critiques President Ilham Aliyev’s response to protests, referencing [azadliq.org](https://www.azadliq.org/p/4321.html) (affiliated with US Congress-funded [Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/radio-free-europe-radio-liberty/)) and juxtaposing it with official statements from the [president.az](https://president.az/az/articles/view/60429). In both articles, Eurasianet juxtaposes official sources with critical commentary, offering a skeptical viewpoint on events and policies. While this approach presents an alternative to official narratives, it lacks balance.
Considering Eurasianet’s apparent critical bias towards the discussed governments, consulting multiple sources may provide readers with a more comprehensive understanding. Lastly, the article
[“Will Biden take on neglected Caucasus and Central Asia?”](https://eurasianet.org/will-biden-take-on-neglected-caucasus-and-central-asia) demonstrates a left-center bias, characterizing “ [Trump’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) erratic approach” in contrast to “ [Biden’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/joe-co-uk-bias/) team of experienced pros,” which critically frames the Trump administration while presenting the Biden administration in a favorable light.
