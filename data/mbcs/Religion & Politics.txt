History
Religion & Politics is an online journal focused on the intersection between religion and US politics. According to their
[about page](https://religionandpolitics.org/about-us/), “Religion & Politics is an online news journal, dedicated to the two topics thought unfit for polite company. We feature articles from scholars and journalists who proceed from a single premise: that for better and for worse, religion and politics converge, clash, and shape public life.”

Analysis / Bias
The website features articles from scholars and journalists who cover how religion and politics intertwine. Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[Religious Nationalism Holds Sway as Virginia Revokes the Rights of Trans Students.](https://religionandpolitics.org/2022/10/26/religious-nationalism-holds-sway-as-virginia-revokes-the-rights-of-trans-students/) This article like all others reviewed, is properly sourced from government sources and credible outlets such as [Forbes](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/forbes/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). The website also links to other related stories from sources such as [The New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/).
Editorially, Religion & Politics usually covers both sides of issues; however, we have determined that many articles are negative toward conservatives and former President Trump, such as this
[The Long Road to White Christians’ Trumpism](https://religionandpolitics.org/2020/12/08/the-long-road-to-white-christians-trumpism/). A quote from the article reads:
Why would Christians vote for a man whose life flaunts their norms? What about his treatment of women? What about his racism and his anti-immigrant policies? After nearly five years of questions, white American Christians still overwhelmingly supported Trump’s unsuccessful 2020 reelection bid.
On the other hand, stories favor Joe Biden, such as this
[Biden Can Restore America’s Credibility on Religious Freedom](https://religionandpolitics.org/2020/11/24/biden-can-restore-americas-credibility-on-religious-freedom/). A quote from the article reads:
We need a president who restores credibility and authenticity to America’s efforts to promote religious freedom for all people everywhere. Joe Biden is the person, to use another biblical phrase, for such a time as this.
On the issues. Religion & Politics is concerned with racism, civil liberties, climate change, and other issues favored by the left. Therefore, we rate them Left-Center biased and fact-based in reporting.
