History
Science Feedback is a worldwide network of scientists sorting fact from fiction in science-based media coverage. They state their
[goal](https://sciencefeedback.co/about/) is to help readers know which news to trust. They also provide feedback to editors about the credibility of information published in their outlets. Each reviewer holds a Ph.D. and has recently published articles in top-tier peer-reviewed science journals. Science Feedback publishes [Climate Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-feedback/), which fact-checks claims regarding climate change, and [Health Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/health-feedback/), which analyzes health and medical claims. [Science Feedback](https://sciencefeedback.co/about/) is a non-profit organization annually certified by the [International Fact-Checking Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fact_Checking_Network).

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Science Feedback website does not produce original content but rather links to
[Climate](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and Health Feedback fact checks. They also provide links to articles in the [press](https://sciencefeedback.co/press-coverage/) that mention Health or Climate Feedback. The website is free from editorial bias as it does not offer opinion pieces or publish news reporting. Further, on September 27, 2019, The IFCN concluded an [investigation](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/the-ifcn-concludes-investigation-about-science-feedback/) into a Science Feedback/Health Feedback [fact check](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/lila-rose-claim-that-abortion-is-never-medically-necessary-is-inaccurate-it-is-necessary-in-certain-cases-to-preserve-mothers-life-young-america-foundation/) and found that “Science Feedback’s conclusion appears sound and fair, based on the best evidence. Their fact-check is an accurate attempt to inform readers on the veracity of a claim and strictly adheres to their scientific fact-checking methodology.”
However, the independent right-leaning Zebra Fact Check
[reports](https://www.zebrafactcheck.com/science-feedback-flunked-fact-checking-101/) that Science Feedback “ignored context, altered a quotation, and ultimately relied on an equivocal argument.” Zebra Fact Check is not a signatory of the IFCN.
