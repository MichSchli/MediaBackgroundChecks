Analysis / Bias
In review, the Bemidji Pioneer reports on news, sports, weather, crime, and entertainment for the greater Bemidji, MN region. Reporters demonstrate minimal bias when reporting local news, such as this
[Duluth’s Blatnik Bridge will be rebuilt, likely to feature new Wisconsin connector](https://www.bemidjipioneer.com/news/local/blatnik-bridge-will-be-rebuilt-likely-to-feature-new-wisconsin-connector). Further, the website publishes national and international news from credible sources such as the [LA Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times-los-angeles-times/) and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/). Finally, all information is sourced via first-person accounts or through credible media.
Editorially, the Bemidji Pioneer reasonably represents both sides. However, a review of columnists demonstrates more favor the right such as this
[Finding Faith: Jesus’ message wasn’t ‘be right at all costs’](https://www.bemidjipioneer.com/opinion/columns/finding-faith-jesus-message-wasnt-be-right-at-all-costs). In general, the news is reported factually and with right-leaning editorial bias.
