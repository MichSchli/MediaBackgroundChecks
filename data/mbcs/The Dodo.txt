Analysis / Bias
In review, The Dodo publishes feel-good stories about animals such as this:
[5 Reasons Why Big Dogs Are The Best.](https://www.thedodo.com/videos/close-to-home/5-reasons-why-big-dogs-are-the-best) Besides feel-good stories, they also report on animals that are threatened by extinction, such as this: [Last Rhino Of His Kind Gets Armed Protection](https://www.thedodo.com/videos/sudan-the-last-rhino). In between articles about wildlife, there are very cute stories such as [this](https://www.thedodo.com/on-the-farm).
Regarding politics, this source has a strong left-leaning bias that is often opposed to former President Trump, such as this:
[Trump Defends His Sonsâ€™ Sick Hobby Of Killing Innocent Animals](https://www.thedodo.com/trump-speaks-on-sons-hunting-1275724124.html). In general, story selection always favors the left and denigrates the right through loaded emotional language.
