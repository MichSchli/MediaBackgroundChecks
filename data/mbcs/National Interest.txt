History
[Founded in 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Interest) by conservative thinker [Irving Kristol](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/weekinreview/battle-splits-conservative-magazine.html), The National Interest (TNI) is an American bi-monthly international affairs magazine published by the [Center for the National Interest](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-the-national-interest/), which we have rated as right-center biased. It is associated with the [ realist school of foreign policy thought,](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/) which contradicts the liberal thought of cooperation. In general, this is a foreign policy magazine that also touches on politics and other current events of our time. You can view their Masthead [here](https://nationalinterest.org/masthead).

Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Interest primarily covers international affairs. Headlines typically utilize minimally loaded words such as these:
[Can Moon Jae-In Bridge the Gap between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un?](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/can-moon-jae-bridge-gap-between-donald-trump-and-kim-jong-un-52757) and [Brexit Will Heighten Division Within the European Union](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/brexit-will-heighten-division-within-european-union-52762). These two articles are properly sourced from credible outlets such as [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/) and [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/).
Articles published are generally pro-military in that they believe aggressive actions are unwarranted, as are passive actions that lead to vulnerability. Still, the theme is the USA comes first despite the action taken.
Editorially, they do not hold a favorable view of former President Trump:
[Trumpism Is a Political Fad](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/trumpism-political-fad-206031) or current President Joe Biden [The Blue-Collar Joe Biden Myth Needs to End](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/blue-collar-joe-biden-myth-needs-end-179560). The National Interest is a factual source that leans right regarding foreign affairs.
