Analysis / Bias
In review, This Magazine publishes original news stories from a progressive left perspective. Headlines and wording often contain moderately loaded emotional language such as this:
[We need to stop pretending there’s no Islamophobia crisis in Canada](https://this.org/2019/02/28/we-need-to-stop-pretending-theres-no-islamophobia-crisis-in-canada/). Although this story is well-written and thorough, it completely lacks hyperlinked sourcing.
Editorially, This Magazine favors issues related to the left, such a
[LGBTQ rights](https://this.org/category/lgbt/), [Climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), and [pro-Education](https://this.org/category/education-2/). Further, they often report negatively on [conservatives](https://this.org/2011/08/09/c-393/) and positively on progressives, in which they criticize [Trudeau](https://this.org/2019/10/01/what-happened-to-justin-trudeau-the-feminist/) for his lack of keeping progressive promises.
