[about page](https://c2cjournal.ca/about/), “C2C’s unabashed bias is in favor of free markets, democratic governance, and individual liberty. We strive for balance, fairness, and accuracy in our reporting and commentary. Our mission is to explore and develop “Ideas that Lead” by encouraging writers to push boundaries, challenge orthodoxies, and advance arguments rooted in the values and principles of classical liberalism and western civilization.” The current editor-in-chief is George Koch.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the C2C Journal produces original long-form journalism from a libertarian/conservative perspective. Articles and headlines often utilize loaded emotional wording such as this
[Statue Smashers: Why History Protesters Are The New Totalitarians](https://c2cjournal.ca/2020/12/statue-smashers-why-history-protesters-are-the-new-totalitarians/). This long-form article is properly sourced to local media and larger publications such as the [New York Times](https://c2cjournal.ca/2020/12/statue-smashers-why-history-protesters-are-the-new-totalitarians/). Story selection favors the right and often denigrates the left such as [The Unbearable Wokeness Of Being In Stratford](https://c2cjournal.ca/2020/11/the-unbearable-wokeness-of-being-in-stratford/).
When it comes to reporting on scientific issues, they do not deny human influence on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). Still, they do not agree with progressive solutions [Justin Trudeau’s Job-Killing Climate Change Plan](https://c2cjournal.ca/2019/12/justin-trudeaus-job-killing-climate-change-plan/). In general, most stories favor a free-market conservative platform and are mostly factual.
