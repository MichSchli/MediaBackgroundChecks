Analysis / Bias
In Defence of Marxism publishes articles on Marxist theory,
[history](https://www.marxist.com/20th-century-revolutions/), and analysis of [current events](https://www.marxist.com/imt-manifesto-on-arab-revolution-part-one.htm). They publish well-sourced analyses such as [“LGBT: Liberation and Revolution”](https://www.marxist.com/lgbt-liberation-and-revolution.htm) and “Bernie’s [ Betrayal: The Fight for Socialism Continues](https://www.marxist.com/bernies-betrayal-the-fight-for-socialism-continues.htm)!” They utilize credible sources such as [ILGA](http://ilga.org/), [Financial Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/financial-times/), [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/), and republish stories from [socialist.net](http://www.socialist.net/); however, they poorly source their opinion pieces and rarely link to the sources. In Defence of Marxism also uses emotionally loaded language in their headlines and the body of the article, such as [“The stinking hypocrisy of Trump’s attack on Syria](https://www.marxist.com/the-stinking-hypocrisy-of-trump-s-attack-on-syria.htm).”
