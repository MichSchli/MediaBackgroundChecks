Analysis / Bias
In review, Israel Hayom covers Israeli and regional news with strong loaded emotional language such as this:
[“Netanyahu won the fight of his life.”](https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/03/03/netanyahu-won-the-fight-of-his-life/) A quote from the article reads, “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu managed to increase the Likud’s electoral share to 36-37 seats – despite the three indictments against him, despite the venomous criticism of him from Blue -and White/Labor Gesher-Meretz/Avigdor Lieberman, despite the media efforts by journalists who long ago stopped being fair and objective analysts and turned into pundits whose goal was to see Netanyahu go to jail – is a huge achievement.”
When describing the opposition, they often use denigrating language such as this “Former IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, on the other hand, scored a painful failure.” In general, Israel Hayom promotes Netanyahu’s political agenda and has a very strong right-leaning bias in reporting. Israel Hayom also
[endorsed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/donald-trumps-the-israeli-media/) Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election and often published strongly biased editorials praising the former President Trump, such as [“An amazing friend to Israel departs the White House; thank you, President Trump.”](https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/11/09/an-amazing-friend-to-israel-departs-the-white-house-thank-you-president-trump/)
When it comes to sourcing, for example, in the article “
[Trump administration formally notifies Congress it plans to sell 50 F-35 jets to UAE](https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/11/11/trump-administration-formally-notifies-congress-it-plans-to-sell-50-f-35-fighter-jets-to-uae/)” they source from the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) They also [source](https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/11/16/chabad-virtual-event-to-highlight-triumph-of-jewish-resilience/) from right-biased Israeli sources such as the [Jewish News Syndicate (JNS).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/jewish-news-syndicate-jns/)
When covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they usually use emotionally charged wording, such as in this
[article](https://www.israelhayom.com/opinions/the-palestinians-have-been-left-on-their-own/), with a quote that reads, “Peace between Israel and the UAE could have benefitted the Palestinians enormously, but they prefer to cling to frustration, anger, and dreams that will never come true.”
In general, they hold right-leaning biases and sometimes publish misinformation in support of Israel’s government (propaganda).
