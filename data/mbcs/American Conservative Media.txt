Analysis / Bias
In review, American Conservative Media is a blog that produces conservative opinions and summarized news stories. Articles and headlines often contain moderately loaded wording such as this:
[Democrats Allow For Illegals To Receive Next Stimulus Checks](https://americanconservativemedia.com/2020/05/16/democrats-allow-for-illegals-to-receive-next-stimulus-checks/). This story does not contain hyperlinked sourcing. In fact, none of the stories reviewed contain sourcing of information. A thorough review of articles reveals that all favor the right, without presenting opposing viewpoints such as this: [President Trump was right, again.](https://americanconservativemedia.com/2020/04/14/president-trump-was-right-again/) In general, this a website that poorly sources information and holds a strong right-leaning bias.
