You couldn’t understand her because she always had dreadlocks and donned baggy masculine trousers. I have never seen her putting on a skirt.”
The Daily Monitor publishes critical articles about the
[right-wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Uganda) populist President Museveni [“Ugandans are lazy, Museveni tells S.African business community.”](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/ugandans-are-lazy-museveni-tells-s-african-business-community-4143152) A quote from the article reads, “In his foreign and local engagements, Mr. Museveni has consistently, without statistical proof, accused Ugandans of being lazy in front of their business competitors.” In another article, they criticize Prime Minister Nabbanja (Right-wing populist), [“Other countries have safety nets, we have Nabbanja.”](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/lifestyle/heart-to-heart/other-countries-have-safety-nets-we-have-nabbanja-4090858)
On the other hand, the Daily Monitor publishes articles with a pro-opposition tone for
[Bobi Wine](https://nupuganda.org/) (Center-Left): [”Bobi Wine’s lonely walk to election day.”](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/special-reports/elections/bobi-wine-s-lonely-walk-to-election-day-3251966)
When it comes to sourcing, The Daily Monitor typically source through quotes such as in this article titled
[“Politicians ‘influencing’ transfer of teachers”](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/-politicians-influencing-transfer-of-teachers-4147898) they use quotes and interviews, and they mention sources without disclosing them “Sources said transferring civil servants aims at strengthening and ensuring effective service delivery.”
In general, the Daily Monitor holds a left-leaning editorial bias and is reasonably fact-based; however, they poorly source information, are not fully transparent on shareholders, and the country has limited press freedom.
