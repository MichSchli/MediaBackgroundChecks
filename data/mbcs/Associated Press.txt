History
Inventor and publisher of The New York Sun,
[Moses Yale Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Yale_Beach), started the Associated Press in 1846. Five New York newspapers created the Associated Press (AP). The AP is a multinational not-for-profit news agency headquartered in New York City and currently owned by its contributing newspapers, radio, and television stations in the United States. The Associated Press (AP) states its [mission](https://www.ap.org/about/our-story/) as “to inform the world” and describes its brief history as “In 1846, five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it. And The Associated Press was born.”

Funded by / Ownership
[The Associated Press (AP) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)is a nonprofit news cooperative with a profit of [$1.6 million](https://www.ap.org/ap-in-the-news/2018/ap-reports-loss-on-one-time-accounting-charges) in 2016.

According to an article titled “ [AP reports loss on one-time accounting charges,”](https://www.ap.org/ap-in-the-news/2018/ap-reports-loss-on-one-time-accounting-charges) the Associated Press lost $74 million in 2017, and it states the reason as “mostly due to one-time accounting charges related to the federal tax overhaul passed late last year.”
Analysis / Bias
AP utilizes moderate-loaded language in their headlines in their political coverage, such as “
[AP Exclusive: Before Trump job, Manafort worked to aid Putin](https://apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a).” However, the articles are always well-sourced. When it comes to their economic coverage, they maintain neutral language and least biased coverage: [“US-China tariffs: What’s behind them, who stands to be hurt?”](https://www.apnews.com/b3af3f8af7d9414e90c8c1662ba4d6f8/US-China-tariffs:-What's-behind-them,-who-stands-to-be-hurt?) The AP also publishes well-researched and sourced articles such as [“Science Says: How family separation may affect kids’ brains,”](https://apnews.com/348936a5a306404ab20125d39a683a40/Science-Says:-How-family-separation-may-affect-kids'-brains) utilizing pro-science sources such as the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-academy-of-pediatrics/).
When reporting on conservatives, the Associated Press usually maintains a neutral voice. However, in
[some articles](https://apnews.com/470b8da7d0da439686342904906c5f43), the author demonstrates bias through loaded emotional language such as this: “PUSHED Ukrainian officials to investigate BASELESS corruption allegations against the Bidens.” While this statement is factual, using “Pushed” and “Baseless” conveys Rudy Giuliani’s negative emotions. The Associated Press generally publishes slightly left-leaning, fact-based news through left-biased editorializing by their authors. It is important to note that the AP does not tolerate misinformation, as evidenced by the firing of a reporter who reported unsubstantiated claims.
Failed Fact Checks
- They are a certified IFCN fact-checker. However, the AP tends to fact-check conservatives more than liberals.
