Analysis / Bias
In review, Creation Ministries International or creation.com promotes 100%
[literal interpretation](https://creation.com/about-us#what_we_believe) of the bible. These include a global flood and the story of Noah, anti-evolution, that humanity sprung forth from Adam and then Eve, and that marriage is only permitted between a man and woman. Ironically, the bible does not literally state that marriage is between men and women. This is a very generous interpretation from the Adam and Eve story and then again in [Matthew 19:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A4-5&version=NIV).
Editorially, all information on the website favors a Christian perspective. Many stories promote misinformation, such as this one that compares abortion to murder
[How abortion harms women: The science](https://creation.com/how-abortion-harms-women). In this story, they report on a study that shows that women who have abortions have a higher rate of breast cancer. This is not true. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/medical-treatments/abortion-and-breast-cancer-risk.html), “After adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors, the researchers found that induced abortion(s) had no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer. The size of this study how it was done provide good evidence that induced abortion does not affect a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer.” In general, Creation Ministries International is a quackery-level pseudoscience organization.
