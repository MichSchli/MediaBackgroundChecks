Funded by / Ownership

[Mercer family](https://theintercept.com/2018/03/23/gatestone-institute-john-bolton-chairs-an-actual-fake-news-publisher-infamous-for-spreading-anti-muslim-hate/) and the [William Rosenwald Family Fund](https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-gatestone-institute/), which is considered a top funder of Islamophobia.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Gatestone Institute is anti-Islamic, pro-Christian, and Jewish/Israel. Many of the articles will link back to sites that don’t say what they claim or make the same rash judgments without proof. Example: Obama tells Christians to not protest in Egypt, then doesn’t provide quotes or sources saying he said that.
Story selection often revolves around portraying Muslims negatively, such as this
[Europe: The Great White Death?](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/11044/europe-white-death) This poorly sourced story arouses fear that Europe could have a larger Muslim population than the Christian population. Based on the title, apparently, only Whites are Christian in Europe? Further, the Gatestone Institute has been frequently criticized for publishing misleading or false information about Muslims, such as these:
[Trump’s new national security adviser chairs a group that has spread false claims about Muslim refugees in Europe](https://www.businessinsider.com/john-bolton-gatestone-institute-muslim-refugees-2018-3?r=UK) [How Geert Wilders Became America’s Favorite Islamophobe](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/01/how-geert-wilders-became-americas-favorite-islamophobe/) [John Bolton presided over anti-Muslim think tank](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/john-bolton-chaired-anti-muslim-think-tank-n868171) [The paranoid style in Islamophobic politics](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/262953-the-paranoid-style-in-islamophobic-politics)
Other organizations, such as the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), have [called](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/22/anti-muslim-round-62218) the Gatestone Institute “an organization known for spreading anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.” Further, they are closely connected to the former Trump administration as John Bolton served as National Security Adviser for Trump, and Alan Dershowitz is represented fprmer President Trump in his Impeachment: [This Anti-Muslim Think Tank Paid Alan Dershowitz and John Bolton Over $250k](https://observer.com/2018/11/anti-muslim-gatestone-institute-think-tank-alan-dershowitz-john-bolton/).
