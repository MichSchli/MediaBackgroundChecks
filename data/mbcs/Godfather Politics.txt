Godfather Politics does not provide ownership information on their website, however the domain is
[registered](http://whois.domaintools.com/godfatherpolitics.com) to Discount Book Distributors. The website is clearly funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Godfather Politics is an extreme right wing website that publishes news and opinions that always favor the right and denigrate the left. There is over-the-top use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[Christmas-Hating Leftists Launch War on Michigan Grade School’s Three Wise Men Display.](https://godfatherpolitics.com/christmas-hating-leftists-launch-war-on-michigan-grade-schools-three-wise-men-display/) They also routinely publish [conspiracy theories](https://godfatherpolitics.com/hillary-clinton-coughing-fits-a-complete-history/) such as those involving Hillary Clinton’s health…2 years after the election. When it comes to sourcing, they [utilize](https://godfatherpolitics.com/the-migrant-caravan-crisis-a-complex-dilemma-for-president-trump/) discredited right wing conspiracy sites such as [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://godfatherpolitics.com/antifa-hangs-severed-pig-heads-and-signs-calling-for-revolutionary-violence-at-texas-political-offices/). In general, every story on this website is sensationalized and mostly misleading to fit the extreme right wing narrative.
