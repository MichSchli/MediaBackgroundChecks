History
The Crime Prevention Research Center is a nonprofit founded in 2013 by John Lott, author of the book “More Guns, Less Crime.” He is best known as an advocate in the gun rights debate, particularly his arguments against restrictions on owning and carrying guns. According to their
[about page](https://crimeresearch.org/about/), “The Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) is a research and education organization dedicated to conducting academic quality research on the relationship between laws regulating the ownership or use of guns, crime, and public safety; educating the public on the results of such research; and supporting other organizations, projects, and initiatives that are organized and operated for similar purposes.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit. They claim on their
[about page](https://crimeresearch.org/about/) that they “do not accept donations from gun or ammunition makers or organizations such as the NRA or any other organizations involved in the gun control debate on either side of the issue. Nor do we accept donations from organizations involved in the debate over illegal immigration.” Although there have been [claims](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/piers-morgan-and-alan-dershowitz-get-in-heated-argument-with-anti-gun-control-advocate/) made that the NRA funds John Lott and the CPRC, there is no evidence to support that claim. Unfortunately, the website lacks transparency and does not disclose funding. Donations generate revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Crime Prevention Research Center produces research and information favorable toward guns. The website publishes research with minimally loaded language such as this:
[Major New Research on School Safety: Schools that Allow Teachers to Carry Guns haven’t seen school shootings during school hours](https://crimeresearch.org/2019/05/major-new-research-on-school-safety-schools-that-allow-teachers-to-carry-guns-havent-seen-school-shootings-during-school-hours/). John Lott conducted this research. Viewing the research presented on their page, all of the research is favorable toward gun ownership and minimizes gun dangers.
The website features an Op-Ed section that curates news from other right-leaning outlets such as
[Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), [Townhall](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/townhall/), [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/), and the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). All of these sources are listed as Mixed factual or questionable due to failed fact checks. Finally, the website has a section dedicated to gun data and statistics from credible sources.
John Lott’s work has been called “
[Junk Science](http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/mythsofmurder.htm),” while right-leaning outlets have [praised](https://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2018/03/17/snopes-blows-fact-checking-crime-prevention-research-center/) the website and Lott’s research.
