Analysis / Bias
Lew Rockwell is a website that promotes conspiracies, pseudoscience, and fringe economic theories. Lew Rockwell uses minimal loaded words in their headlines and articles. Still, they typically source from far-right or questionable sources such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), and the #1 purveyor of pseudoscience [Joseph Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/). Some topics on the website are those related to [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/), [Mind Control](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2018/02/no_author/mk-ultra-what-they-didnt-tell-you-about-the-mind-control-program-thats-probably-still-operational/), [False Flags](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2018/04/no_author/false-flags-are-real/), and [anti-immigration](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2018/01/no_author/immigration-and-the-deep-state/) articles from other questionable sources. Further, the Lew Rockwell website has been placed on the [Hatewatch list](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2009/12/14/lew-rockwell%E2%80%99s-website-warns-coming-us-civil-war) by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/).

This story originates from [LifeSiteNews](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/), a questionable source that frequently fails fact-checks regarding science. We also found that they often source from other questionable and conspiracy sources such as [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and [Ron Paul](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-ron-paul-institute/). Further, during 2020 Presidential Election, they frequently promoted election fraud conspiracies such as this [Democrats Must Not Be Allowed To Get Away With Their Criminal Election Fraud](https://web.archive.org/web/20201110234030/https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/11/vasko-kohlmayer/democrats-must-not-be-allowed-to-get-away-with-their-criminal-election-fraud/). There has been [no evidence](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election) of unusual election fraud to date. In general, Lew Rockwell is a low-credibility source that frequently publishes right-wing disinformation.
