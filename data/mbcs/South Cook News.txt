They are a part of Brian Timpone’s Imposter website network with over 1200 websites with the same design and an about page that reads “We believe in limited government, in the constructive role of the free market, and in the rights of citizens to choose the size and scope of their government and the role it should play in their society.”
West Cook News lacks transparency as they do not disclose funding or ownership.
