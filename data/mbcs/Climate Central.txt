Analysis / Bias
In review, Climate Central reports on climate change science, effects, and solutions. Articles and headlines are generally low-biased but sometimes convey an emotion such as
[‘Give us a break, Lord’: Amid active hurricane season, pandemic halts recovery in Florida two years after Michael](https://www.climatecentral.org/news/give-us-a-break-lord-amid-active-hurricane-season-pandemic-halts-recovery-in-florida-two-years-after-michael). Information is usually properly sourced to credible media outlets and always factual. While they lean left politically in their concern for climate change, they are pro-science in their publications and approach.
