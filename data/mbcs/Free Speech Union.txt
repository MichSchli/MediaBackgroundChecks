Analysis / Bias
The Free Speech Union’s
[FAQ section](https://freespeechunion.org/faqs/) covers topics like workplace pronoun use, police record issues, human rights law, social media’s role in work, and critiques of anti-racism training.
Our review of the
[“Anti-Racism and Unconscious Bias Training”](https://freespeechunion.org/anti-racism-and-unconscious-bias-training/) subsection reveals skepticism towards programs like Implicit Association Testing (IAT) and Unconscious Bias Training (UBT), framing them as based on “dubious theories” like Critical Race Theory and imposing “collective guilt” on certain demographics. The section implies that support for movements like Black Lives Matter may be coerced by employers or peers, and it questions the effectiveness of diversity training.
In support of its claims, FSU cites a
[briefing paper](https://freespeechunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Unconscious-Bias-Training.pdf) by journalist [Carrie Clark](https://freespeechunion.org/about/who-we-are/), which includes endnotes, citing sources from opinion pieces and discussions rather than direct links to corroborating peer-reviewed research, some of these, such as the links to [Quartz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/quartz/) and OSF, are broken, which hinders verification of the cited material. Other sources include articles from [The Cut](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-cut/) and [The Conversation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/). The lack of accessible details on Carrie Clark’s academic credentials or her standing in the scientific community makes it difficult to ascertain the reliability of her research, which is significant given its use by the Free Speech Union to substantiate their positions. This approach, with its reliance on a narrow range of sources, reflects the FSU’s critical perspective on mainstream anti-racism training and the application of Critical Race Theory in workplace settings.
The article titled
[“Write to your MP to raise free speech concerns about Government’s plans to publish a bill banning conversion therapy”](https://freespeechunion.org/) employs minimally loaded language, emphasizing the importance of free speech without being overly sensational. The body of the article presents a one-sided view against the proposed conversion therapy ban, using emotionally loaded language to argue that the ban could infringe on free speech and parental rights. It includes citations to support its claims, although the sources are used to support a specific narrative. The sources cited are [The Times UK](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-times-of-london/) and [Daily Telegraph (UK).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-telegraph/#google_vignette) The tone and choice of language suggest a bias against the ban and in favor of the organization’s stance on free speech and against what they perceive as “woke” activism.
In general, FSU promotes that they are engaged in a “
[Culture War](https://freespeechunion.org/weekly-news-round-up-25/)” and rejects “Woke” ideology, indicating a conservative right bias.
Failed Fact Checks
- None by a third-party fact checker; however, FSU and Tobey Young had their
[accounts closed by PayPal](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/paypal-free-speech-union-accounts-shut-over-covid-misinformation-90bzf2b2g)for the promotion of misinformation related to COVID-19. The ban was reversed a few days later.
Overall, the Free Speech Union is right-biased based on advocacy and editorial positions that align with a conservative perspective. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to poor sourcing techniques and one-sided reporting that excludes opposing viewpoints. (M. Huitsing 11/08/2023)
