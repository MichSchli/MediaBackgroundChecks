Analysis / Bias
The 2020 Conservative publishes poorly sourced news articles from other sources. Articles and headlines contain highly emotional wording such as this
[THERE’S ONE SICK TRICK THAT SLEEPY JOE HASN’T PULLED YET….](https://2020conservative.com/theres-one-sick-trick-that-sleepy-joe-hasnt-pulled-yet/) This article is from the far-right, questionable source [Wayne Dupree](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/waynedupree-com/). Other articles are not sourced at all.
Editorially, all stories favor the right, and most denigrate the left, such as this
[SICK PERVERT DON LEMON HAS BEEN HIT WITH SOME AMAZINGLY BAD NEWS!](https://2020conservative.com/sick-pervert-don-lemon-has-been-hit-with-some-amazingly-bad-news/) Finally, they also publish conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccine, such as this [BILL GATES: “VACCINES ARE “BEST WAY” TO DEPOPULATE](https://2020conservative.com/bill-gates-vaccines-are-best-way-to-depopulate-3/). Bill Gates [did not say that](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/bill-gates-didnt-say-he-wanted-to-use-vaccines-to-reduce-the-population/). In general, 2020 Conservative is an extreme right-biased source that publishes misinformation and lacks credibility.
