Analysis / Bias
In review, AmoMama primarily reports on entertainment news and celebrity gossip. Headlines use minimally loaded language, such as this
[Celebrity Couples Who Got Back Together after a Breakup or Divorce](https://news.amomama.com/171395-celebrity-couples-who-got-back-together.html). Stories are usually properly sourced to other credible media outlets. The website also publishes world news with minimal bias and proper sourcing such as this [Hurricane Dorian Leaves around 70,000 People Homeless in the Bahamas](https://news.amomama.com/171666-hurricane-dorian-leaves-70000-people-hom.html). Although they claim on their about page that they do not cover politics, there is a tab that links to political news stories.
In general, AmoMama focuses on entertainment news utilizing proper sourcing and presenting with minimal bias; however, they do occasionally promote pseudoscience such as this:
