[Proposed ‘Whitecourt Launch’ policy could help aspiring entrepreneurs](https://www.whitecourtstar.com/news/local-news/whitecourt-launch-could-help-entrepreneurs). The national news is derived primarily from the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/) and [National Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-post/), whereas world news comes from multiple sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/). Generally, straight news reporting is factual and presents minimal biased wording; however, story selection tends to lean right.
Editorially, there is a clear right-leaning bias with commentaries. While the Whitecourt Star does offer opposing viewpoints, on the whole, more editorials favor the conservative right.
