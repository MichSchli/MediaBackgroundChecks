Analysis / Bias
The Hillsboro Star-Journal focuses on local news reporting and does not publish national news on its website or newspaper. Articles and headlines do not use emotionally loaded language such as this
[EMS Chief May Lose License](http://starj.com/). However, this story lacks hyperlinking like all others on the website.
Editorially, a review of op-eds indicates a balance of views. In general, the Hillsboro Star-Journal is mostly fact-based and exhibits minimal bias in reporting.
