Analysis / Bias
The Guardian Nigeria has a balanced approach when reporting national politics. They utilize minimally loaded headlines such as
[”2023 presidential election must be challenged, says Atiku.”](https://guardian.ng/politics/2023-presidential-election-must-be-challenged-says-atiku/) This article features a speech by the presidential candidate of the Center-Right PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Another article titled [“Election: APC says Tinubu victory well deserved”](https://guardian.ng/news/election-apc-says-tinubu-victory-well-deserved/) consists of quotes from APC’s publicity secretary, Mr. Felix Morka. Finally, in another article about the elections, [“We will follow legal, peaceful procedures to reclaim our mandate, says Obi,”](https://guardian.ng/politics/we-will-follow-legal-peaceful-procedures-to-reclaim-our-mandate-says-obi/) features reporting on Mr. Obi’s Speech. Mr. Obi is the Labour Party Presidential Candidate in the 2023 election. In other words, they cover all sides.
In general, the Guardian Nigeria does not hold significant political bias, but they poorly source by not always using hyperlinks, lack transparency in ownership, and have failed numerous fact checks.
