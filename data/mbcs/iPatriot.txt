History
iPatriot is a news and opinion website with a right bias in reporting. Their
[tagline](https://ipatriot.com/about/) is “News by you. for you.” This is accurate as iPatriot is a citizen journalism website where writers submit their articles, and iPatriot publishes them.
The website does not name an editor.
Funded by / Ownership
According to their
[about page](https://ipatriot.com/about/), iPatriot is owned and operated by Dorm 18 – 1 Productions, a Christian organization with a libertarian bent. Revenue was derived from a store linked to [Patriot Depot](https://patriotdepot.com/), which sells conservative-themed merchandise.
Analysis / Bias
iPatriot features news articles and content published by members. In reviewing articles I found that most are opinion-based and slant heavily to the right based on the wording and political topics. For example, this article uses loaded language to convey a rejection of reparations
[Reparations: Democrats Scam and Insult Blacks Again](https://ipatriot.com/reparations-democrats-scam-and-insult-blacks-again/). This story provides hyperlinks to sources, but one of them is the questionable and low factual [Rush Limbaugh](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rushlimbaugh-com/). In another story, [Democrat Propaganda – All Negative All the Time](https://ipatriot.com/democrat-propaganda-all-negative-all-the-time/) does not provide a source for the opinionated claims.
Editorially, all stories favor the right and lack credibility due to a lack of editorial vetting and poor sourcing of information. In general, this is a right-wing opinion blog.
