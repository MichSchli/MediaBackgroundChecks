In review, elDiario.es publishes articles from a progressive perspective. The headlines often use emotionally loaded language such as
[“We want to be, be and exist without fear.”](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/orgullo-critico-toma-calle-queremos-existir-miedo_1_8082817.html) The article is about Pride walk and LGBT rights. They typically cover opposition parties’ perspectives with a negative tone, such as in this article where they are critical of conservative People’s Party (PP) leader Pablo Casado [“The two faces of Casado.”](https://www.eldiario.es/opinion/zona-critica/casado-pp-vox-lgtbiq-fondos-europeos-orban_129_8076799.html) Further, in this article, the author compares Casado (center-right People’s Party (PP) to far-right Santiago Abascal – ultra-right Vox party). A quote from the article reads, “The PP and Vox are two sides of the same coin, be it that of false patriotism or that of explicit homophobia. It is the same family.”
When it comes to coverage of center-left PM Pedro Sánchez, elDiario.es uses a softer tone such as “
[Sánchez rejects that Junqueras is at the dialogue table: “It is between governments, and he has years of disqualification left.”](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/sanchez-rechaza-junqueras-mesa-dialogo-gobiernos-le-quedan-anos-inhabilitacion_1_8081153.html) They also strike a critical tone of the left-populist party Podemos leader [Pablo Iglesias Turrión.](https://www.eldiario.es/euskadi/blogs/viento-del-norte/pablo-iglesias-turrion-cancion-cecilia_132_1527291.html) For example, a quote from the article reads, “I am concerned that Pablo Iglesias insists on putting sticks in the wheel of Pedro Sánchez’s PSOE, creating all kinds of doubts and feeding uncertainties.”
El Diario.es typically sources to itself; however, they also utilize both news agency material, particularly Agencia EFE, S.A. (Spanish international news agency), and they collaborate with
[The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/) and credible sources such as [Whitehouse.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/whitehouse-gov/) and the [Washington Post.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) Most articles are neutral when covering the USA, such as this “ [Biden’s Advice for Employers Who Can’t Find Workers: “Pay Them More.”](https://www.eldiario.es/rastreador/solucion-biden-dificultades-empresarios-encontrar-trabajadores-pagadles_132_8074266.html) In general, elDiario.es reports news factually and with a left-leaning editorial bias.
