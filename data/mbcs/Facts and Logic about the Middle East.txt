Analysis / Bias
In review, FLAME has an extreme bias for Israel and against Muslims. According to
[The Village Voice](http://www.villagevoice.com/news/political-ads-shot-down-6416198), when a reporter “pointed out the overt bigotry” in a FLAME ad in 1998 that described Islam as “virulent” and blamed it for promoting violence against the U.S. and Israel, FLAME’s Gerardo Joffe said, “All Arab Muslims may not be a bunch of fanatics, but I’ve never met one who isn’t.”
Articles and headlines contain moderately loaded language such as this
[The Israel Apartheid Lie](https://www.factsandlogic.org/ad_175_the-israel-apartheid-lie/). This public relations message is completely unsourced. In the article, [Will President Biden get trapped by failed Israel-Palestinian conflict policies of the past,](https://www.factsandlogic.org/will-president-biden-get-trapped-by-failed-israel-palestinian-conflict-policies-of-the-past/) they again do not provide hyperlinked sourcing. Editorially, they strongly favor right-leaning former prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [Israel’s PM Netanyahu’s brilliant speech at the U.N.: “Have you no decency? Have you no shame?”](http://factsandlogic.org/hotline_archive/flame_hotline_093009.html). In general, the information may be factual, but without properly citing information, it is difficult for the reader to investigate further.
