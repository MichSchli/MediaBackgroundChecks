History
The
[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_a_Responsible_Federal_Budget) (CRFB) is an independent, non-profit, bipartisan public policy organization based in Washington, D.C., that addresses federal budget and fiscal issues. CRFB focuses on many issues, including deficit reduction, “entitlement” reform, fundamental tax reform, improving the budget process, and other topical issues as they arise.
It was founded in 1981 by former United States Representatives Robert Giaimo (D-CT) and Henry Bellmon (R-OK), and its board of directors includes former Members of Congress and directors of the Office of Management and Budget Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The CRFB is primarily concerned with reducing the federal budget generally through entitlement reform. The website offers news and a blog that uses minimal loaded words such as this
[Treasury Reports $63 Billion Deficit for July, Pushing FY 2020 Total to $2.8 Trillion](http://www.crfb.org/press-releases/treasury-reports-63-billion-deficit-july-pushing-fy-2020-total-28-trillion). This story is sourced to the Treasury Department. When reporting on political issues, they remain primarily neutral with stories like this: [How Much Would President Trump’s Executive Orders Cost?](http://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-president-trumps-executive-orders-cost)
Editorially, CRFB generally aligns with the right regarding fiscal matters; however, they report on
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) from a pro-science perspective that [evaluates economics](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/evaluating-cost-climate-change) rather than the actual science of climate change. Generally, information is presented with a very slight right lean regarding budgets.
