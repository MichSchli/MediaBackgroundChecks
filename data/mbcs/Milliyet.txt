Analysis / Bias
The media in Turkey is currently separated into two groups. Pro-government media is called the
[“pool media,”](https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/murat-yetkin/the-new-media-disorder-in-turkey-82654) and the other is called the opposition media. Milliyet is considered to be in the pool media after it was sold to Demiroren Group, which is closely related to the right-leaning AKP party and President Erdogan.
In review, Milliyet publishes sensational articles with emotionally loaded language and incorporates headlines mostly from British tabloids such as the
[Questionable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/) Daily Mail [“Tuvalet kağıtlarıyla yaptığı pasta Daily Mail’e manşet oldu.”](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/cadde/galeri/tuvalet-kagitlariyla-yaptigi-pasta-daily-maile-manset-oldu-6201501/1) Milliyet publishes articles that are neutral towards the opposition such as “ [İBB Başkanı Ekrem İmamoğlu, Özel Halk Otobüslerinin yakıt ve sürücü giderlerinin de İBB tarafından karşılanacağını duyurdu.”](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/ekonomi/ibbden-flas-bir-karar-daha-6173804)
When it comes to national news, Milliyet publishes articles with a pro-government tone
[“Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan’dan ‘corona salgını ne zaman tam olarak bitecek?’ sorusuna cevap”](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/siyaset/cumhurbaskani-erdogandan-corona-salgini-ne-zaman-tam-olarak-bitecek-sorusuna-cevap-6192631). Milliyet is often poorly sourced by hyperlinking to themselves or using false hyperlinks which ends up on their homepage, such as in this [article](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/dunya/irandan-israilin-su-altyapisina-elektronik-saldiri-6207644). When covering world news, pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a neutral tone such as in this [article.](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/dunya/trumpa-cok-kotu-haber-yakinindaki-ismin-corona-virus-testi-pozitif-cikti-6207522) Milliyet also prefers large pictures with minimum [writing](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/galeri/son-dakika-haberi-plan-ortaya-cikti-ilk-cuma-namazi-okullar-6207060/1). In general, they are a tabloid like paper that publishes pro-government propaganda.
