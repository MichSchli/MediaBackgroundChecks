History
Founded in 2018, Truthbrary is a parody website based on Sacha Baron Cohen’s TV show
[Who is America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Is_America%3F), which is a political satire mockumentary. The website is based on Cohen’s alter ego Ruddick who directs people to visit his website, which consists of crazy conspiracy theories and fake news. The website description reads: “This website is TRUTHBRARY.ORG. It is a collection of studies and investigations carried out by Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick for the good of the American people. Now it the time when the American people must take back control of our media. The mainstream media cannot be trusted. They have their own agenda and are beholden to the whim of the deep state and the Illuminati. We must take control of our facts and our truth. We must stand together to fight the dark forces of Clintons and Muslims and Godless peoples to stand strong for our religious freedom and hold forth for what is right in our country. Now is the time for the silent majority to come together and seek out our truth.” (note: spelling and grammar errors a part of the satire)

Analysis / Bias
Truthbrary is a satire website that mocks conspiracy and right-wing fake news sites. A sample article headline reads:
[OBAMA IS A KENYAN.](https://www.truthbrary.org/copy-of-illuminati-7) The website is intentionally designed to look very amateur and contains strategic spelling and grammar errors to appear more real.
