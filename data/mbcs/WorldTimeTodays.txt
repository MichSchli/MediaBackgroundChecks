[Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov jokes about “suffering” at the United Nations General Assembly](https://worldtimetodays.com/russian-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov-jokes-about-suffering-at-the-united-nations-general-assembly/); unfortunately, the source used is a state [Russian propaganda news agency](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/650b9a939a79478a580ea09c).
Editorially, they cover a wide range of
[views, such as this](https://worldtimetodays.com/biden-wants-to-use-your-tax-dollars-for-this-california-cause/) from conservative media personality [Glenn Beck](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/glenn-beck-bias-rating/), who has a poor track record with fact checkers. They also cover left-leaning views such as this [Biden’s American Climate Corps isn’t enough — but it’s a start](https://worldtimetodays.com/bidens-american-climate-corps-isnt-enough-but-its-a-start/).
