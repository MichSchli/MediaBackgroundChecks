Analysis / Bias
In review, Truth Theory publishes stories on science, technology, the environment, and uplifting accounts, usually about animals. Articles and headlines typically do not contain loaded emotional language

In a previous review of Truth Theory, we found examples of promoting conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. However, these articles have been deleted, and in an Email, Mr. Sygula states, “our direction changed completely in recent years, and your description does not match the current version of the website.” While all previous conspiracy links have been removed, we did find an article that questions how the
[World Trade Center buildings](https://truththeory.com/2019/09/02/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-call-for-new-9-11-investigation/) collapsed.

In general, Truth Theory, in 2022, is publishing factual news stories from a left-leaning perspective.
