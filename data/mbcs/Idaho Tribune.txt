History
[The Idaho Tribune](https://www.idahotribune.org/shop/p/monthly-subscription) is a local media source focusing on news and issues relevant to Idaho. It emphasizes conservative viewpoints. The specific history of the Idaho Tribune, such as its founding date and key figures in its establishment, is not detailed on the About/Contact Page. However, the emphasis on local issues and events, such as activities in [North Idaho College](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/canceling-north-idaho-college) and the [Kootenai Health](https://www.idahotribune.org/kootenai-health) saga, suggests a strong regional focus. The call to “support conservative news” and uphold “ [Christian Values that Idaho loves and cherishes”](https://www.idahotribune.org/) indicates a funding approach that appeals specifically to a conservative reader base.

The Idaho Tribune’s ownership is unclear, but the
[Idaho Capital Sun](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/idaho-capital-sun-bias/) [reports](https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/12/12/influential-idaho-freedom-foundation-quietly-hired-alt-right-propagandist-to-help-shape-messaging/) it’s managed by David Reilly, an “alt-right propagandist” linked to Idaho’s far-right politics and the Idaho Freedom Foundation. While the Tribune doesn’t explicitly state a connection with the [Idaho Freedom Foundation](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/tag/Idaho+Freedom+Foundation) on its website, it has a section dedicated to news about the Foundation, indicating significant interest in Foundation-related topics.

Analysis / Bias
The Idaho Tribune displays a distinct conservative bias, evident in its use of emotionally loaded language in headlines like
[“SELLOUTS](https://www.idahotribune.org/news),” “ [UNHINGED,”](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/unhinged-liberal-coeur-dalene-city-councilman-goes-on-tirade) and [“Ad Hominem Ad Nauseam.”](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/ad-hominem-ad-nauseam) This bias is also apparent in articles such as [“Happy 4/20? Top 10 Reasons Why Marijuana Should NOT Be Legalized In Idaho](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/happy-4-20-top-10-reasons-why-marijuana-should-not-be-legalized-in-idaho)” and “ [SHOCK POLL: 1 in 4 High School Students Now Identifies As LGBTQ — And We’re Supposed To Believe That Kids AREN’T Being Groomed?”](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/shock-poll-1-in-4-high-school-students-now-identifies-as-lgbtq-and-were-supposed-to-believe-that-nobody-is-grooming-them) Authored by [Samantha Collins](https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/12/12/influential-idaho-freedom-foundation-quietly-hired-alt-right-propagandist-to-help-shape-messaging/), reportedly a likely pseudonym with an AI-generated image, these articles showcase selective sourcing and a partisan stance.
Finally, another article
[How Agenda 21 Was Implemented In The United States](https://www.idahotribune.org/news/how-agenda-21-was-implemented-in-the-united-states) attempts to link organizations like the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, and initiatives such as [Agenda 21](https://bigthink.com/health/agenda-21-a-wild-conspiracy-theory-reignited-by-coronavirus/) and the [Great Reset](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/great-reset-conspiracy-flourishes-amid-continued-pandemic) to a covert global conspiracy that lacks credible evidence and is based on misinterpretations. These entities, in reality, function as think tanks and discussion forums for global issues, operating transparently and without the sinister motives ascribed to them by conspiracy theorists.
The combination of poor sourcing, sensational language, the promotion of conspiracy theories, and a lack of ownership transparency makes this source questionable. The reporting often targets liberal or progressive actions, indicating a preference for conservative narratives and potential selective reporting. This approach, marked by sensational language and a clear editorial stance supporting conservative causes, suggests a right-leaning bias in the Idaho Tribune.
