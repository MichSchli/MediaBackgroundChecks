Analysis / Bias
In review, CNET could easily fall into our
[Pro-Science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pro-science/) category as most content is related to tech or science and is factual. While their forte is the massive library of free and paid software and apps available for download, there’s much more to CNET. They report on science news, new technology, consumer electronics, cars, and smart home gadgets and produce tech-related videos and podcasts. There’s also an extensive how-to section for getting the most out of your electronics and a deals section for finding the best stuff at the best price.
While CNET doesn’t often report on politics, they do when it pertains to their genre. For example, in this article regarding Trump and a tech company, they utilize minimally loaded language and source properly:
[Trump reiterates Huawei as ‘national security threat](https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-says-he-doesnt-want-to-do-business-with-huawei-due-to-national-security-threat/).’ CNET typically does not take editorial positions but instead publishes information when it pertains to politics.
