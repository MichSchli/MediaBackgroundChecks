Analysis / Bias
In review, the Washington Blade publishes news about LGBT issues and the community. There is minimal use of loaded language in articles such as this:
[John McCain leaves complicated legacy on LGBT rights](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/08/27/john-mccain-leaves-complicated-legacy-on-lgbt-rights/). Story selection tends to favor the left as they cover social issues related to the LGBT community. Information contained in the stories is properly sourced from credible media outlets and is usually balanced and well-written.
Editorially most stories favor the left, such as this
[Fla. rule would effectively ban gender-affirming care for minors.](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2022/10/29/fla-rule-would-effectively-ban-gender-affirming-care-for-minors/) They also present negative opinions of conservatives, such as this [Child drag queen’s mother blasts conservative critics](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/01/10/child-drag-queens-mother-blasts-conservative-critics/). Generally, the news is reported factually with a left-leaning editorial bias.
