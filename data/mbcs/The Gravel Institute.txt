Analysis / Bias
The Gravel Institute was created specifically to
[counter](https://www.salon.com/2020/11/29/the-internet-has-become-captured-by-the-right-the-gravel-institute-is-trying-to-take-it-back/) the conservative and questionable [PragerU](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/prageru/). For example, the Gravel Institute produces videos similar to PragerU, such as this [How to Defeat PragerU: The Gravel Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvI68YO7dVY) and [How Socialists Can Win Elections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h1-HhaOmMo). They also publish mini-documentaries promoting views such as this [COVID-19 and Capitalism (with Richard Wolff)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx2RFH-KoY8).
Editorially, they clearly state their progressive agenda on the about page, which consists of ending imperial wars, a direct democracy, redistribution of wealth, and anti-capitalism messages.
[They state](https://www.gravelinstitute.org/about), “We live under capitalism, an economic system which engages in the exploitation of billions of people around the world. The Institute advocates creating a more equal and just economy by democratizing ownership and redistributing wealth in America and around the world.”
