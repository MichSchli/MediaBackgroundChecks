Analysis / Bias
In review, The Toledo Blade reports local news through journalists with minimal loaded words and proper sourcing. National and World news come primarily from the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, according to Ballotpedia, the Toledo Blade always endorses Democratic candidates in Presidential elections. However, in 2016 they did not endorse either candidate, and in 2020 they
[endorsed](https://thevillagereporter.com/america-first-mindset-toledo-blade-endorses-president-trump/) Republican Donald Trump for President. A thorough review of editorial columns indicates that they publish both sides; however, right-leaning opinion outweighs the left.
