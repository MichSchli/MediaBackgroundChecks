Analysis / Bias
In review, the Mail & Guardian uses strong, emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as
[“Future of the left in South Africa. Left? What left?”](https://mg.co.za/article/2020-01-03-00-future-of-the-left-in-south-africa-left-what-left/) They also are openly critical of some ANC policies and President Ramaphosa. ANC (The African National Congress) is the Republic of South Africa’s governing political party. The political position of ANC is Centre-Left. Here is a quote from the article “The fact is that, even if Ramaphosa were able to magically fix the state-owned enterprises and reduce corruption, we would still be screwed.”
Another article titled
[“Another one bites the dust: Ntuli quits Democratic Alliance”](https://mg.co.za/politics/2022-03-17-another-one-bites-the-dust-ntuli-quits-democratic-alliance/) demonstrates negative reporting toward the Democratic Alliance, a center-right opposition party.
The Mail & Guardian typically sources
[through quotes](https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-05-04-presidency-brings-charges-against-sars-commissioner-tom-moyane/) and rarely links to other sources in their articles. On US politics, they publish articles with an anti-Trump tone such as here [“US needs a gutsy Biden now.”](https://mg.co.za/thoughtleader/2021-02-04-us-needs-a-gutsy-biden-now/) A quote from the article reads, “His despicable moral compass and absence of empathy led him to lampoon the rival Democrat nominee as a senile aging man using the moniker “Sleepy Joe” (despite his own documented slow and halting descent down a ramp).” They tend to utilize credible sources for their world news, such as [pewresearch.org, ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/) [ABC News,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/) [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), and [BBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/). In general, they present with left-leaning editorial bias and are not always factual.
