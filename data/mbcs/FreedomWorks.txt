Less Government. More Freedom.” The website has categories that describe the issues they support, such as
[Term Limits](http://www.freedomworks.org/issue/term-limits), [Budget & Spending](http://www.freedomworks.org/issue/budget-spending), and [Healthcare Reform](http://www.freedomworks.org/issue/health-care-reform). The website also features a blog that consistently favors the right with stories like [Beware Coronavirus Cronyism](http://www.freedomworks.org/content/beware-coronavirus-cronyism) and this, [Aren’t Democrats Supposed to Hate Monopolies?](https://www.freedomworks.org/content/aren%E2%80%99t-democrats-supposed-hate-monopolies)
When it comes to politics, FW does not always agree with former President Trump; however, their disdain for Socialism often creates a situation where they praise Trump, even though he is not a true advocate of the Free Market:
[FreedomWorks Statement in Response to President Trump’s Third State of the Union Address](https://www.freedomworks.org/content/freedomworks-statement-response-president-trump%E2%80%99s-third-state-union-address). Scientifically, FW does not align with the consensus of science regarding [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), where they frequently call [scientists alarmists](https://www.freedomworks.org/content/climate-change-crazies-moore-money-steve-moore). In general, FreedomWorks reports news Mixed factually with a strong right-wing bias in story selection and wording.
