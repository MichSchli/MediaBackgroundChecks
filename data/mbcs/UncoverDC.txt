Analysis / Bias
UncoverDC primarily publishes commentary and analysis on their perception that the media does not report truthfully, whereas they do. The website also features links to podcasts.
Articles and headlines contain highly emotional wording that favors the right such as this
[CNN Shows Its Naked Bias About The Arizona Audit](https://uncoverdc.com/2021/05/27/cnn-shows-its-naked-bias-about-the-arizona-audit/). This story is reasonably sourced to credible media outlets such as [The Hill](https://uncoverdc.com/2021/05/27/cnn-shows-its-naked-bias-about-the-arizona-audit/) and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, UncoverDC frequently promotes debunked right-wing conspiracy theories such as the Presidential election of 2020 being stolen from Donald Trump
[Lindell v. Dominion/Smartmatic: Exhibit 12 Forensics](https://uncoverdc.com/2021/06/05/lindell-v-dominion-smartmatic-exhibit-12-forensics/). The source for the story is [Mike Lindell](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frank-speech-mike-lindell/) ( [My Pillow Guy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lindell-tv/)), who routinely promotes false claims regarding the election. Further, throughout 2020-2021 they consistently advanced false or misleading information regarding the coronavirus. For example, they promote [mask information](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) such as this [Study Concludes Facemasks Ineffective and Detrimental](https://uncoverdc.com/2021/04/21/study-concludes-facemasks-ineffective-and-detrimental/). The [consensus of science](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/mask-use-does-not-lead-to-a-higher-risk-of-covid-19-as-viral-social-media-posts-claim/) is that mask use is safe and reduces the rate of transmission. They have also reported that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for Covid-19. [Evidence suggests that it not effective](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19).
In general, this source promotes false and misleading information to advance a far-right agenda, which validates former President Trump. The website publishes other conspiracy theories on various topics, such as the
[Seth Rich Murder](https://uncoverdc.com/2019/07/10/dark-to-light-uncoverdc-the-ira-and-seth-rich/) and Qanon, which is considered a domestic terrorist threat. On the whole, they are not a credible source of information.
