Analysis / Bias
In review, Big News Network utilizes minimally loaded language in their headlines and articles, such as
[“Giuliani admits he is aiming to delegitimize Mueller’s probe.”](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/257366997/giuliani-admits-he-is-aiming-to-delegitimize-muellers-probe) In news articles, they use large blocks of quotes such as “U.S. Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein said that action would be taken if any infiltration was found and added, “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.” However, they fail to provide links to the source of the quote. Big News Network is low-biased and balanced in its news reporting, but it fails to utilize hyperlinked sources.
