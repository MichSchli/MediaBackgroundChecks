Analysis / Bias
In review, Patriot Beat always uses strong excessive loaded language in their headlines such as this:
[Obamaâ€™s Cronies Showed Their TRUE Anti-American Colors With THIS Outrageous Move](https://patriotbeat.com/2018/05/13/obamas-cronies-showed-their-true-anti-american-colors-with-this-outrageous-move/). This particular article is essentially a republish of an article from the Questionable [Conservative Tribune](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/conservative-tribune/), which has failed numerous fact checks. All stories published favor the right and denigrate the left. Patriot Beat generally republishes stories from Mixed factual sources such as the [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) and questionable sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and [Big League Politics.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/big-league-politics/)
