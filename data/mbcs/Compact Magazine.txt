Analysis / Bias
Despite neutrality efforts, Compact Magazine exhibits a critical stance towards President Joe Biden compared to former President Donald Trump. The Magazine’s coverage scrutinizes
[Biden’s](https://www.compactmag.com/tag/joe-biden/) policies and decisions, particularly in foreign policy, such as [“Biden’s Foreign-Policy Abyss,”](https://www.compactmag.com/article/biden-s-foreign-policy-abyss/) and border management, such as [“Biden’s Border Chutzpah,” ](https://www.compactmag.com/article/biden-s-border-chutzpah/)often emphasizing perceived failures or controversies.
On the other hand, articles related to Donald Trump explore his legal challenges, economic policies, and the broader cultural resonance of his rallies. For instance,
[“Donald Trump, Defendant in Chief”](https://www.compactmag.com/article/donald-trump-defendant-in-chief/) draws parallels between Trump’s legal battles and the experiences of many Americans with the criminal justice system, potentially evoking sympathy among readers with similar experiences.
Another article,
[“Trump’s Hamiltonian Moment,”](https://www.compactmag.com/article/trump-s-hamiltonian-moment/) contextualizes Trump’s tariff policies within American economic history, likening them to Alexander Hamilton’s economic nationalism.
Similarly, in
[“Left-Behind- America Sticks With Trump,”](https://www.compactmag.com/article/left-behind-america-sticks-with-trump/) the author critiques both the left-leaning media and the GOP’s right-wing elites, suggesting both are out of touch, suggesting a favorable view towards populist policies and utilize selective sources and rhetoric to support their claims. It relies on opinion pieces and editorials from publications such as The New York Times, [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/), and [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/) selective quotes without external hyperlinks. Regarding sourcing, citation practices within Compact Magazine vary among authors, with some including external references such as [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/) and [Brennan Center for Justice](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/brennan-center-for-justice/). However, most rely heavily on the author’s analysis, observations, and quotes. In general, there’s a lack of consistent citations of external sources throughout the Magazine.
While more stories favor the right, they also cover stories with a left-leaning bias, especially when it comes to labor and workers’ rights like this
[Bring Back the ‘Made-in-America’ Left](https://www.compactmag.com/article/bring-back-the-made-in-america-left/). Therefore, they fall in the Right-Center category based on story selection that moderately favors the right.
