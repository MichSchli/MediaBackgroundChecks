Analysis / Bias
Dissident Voice focuses on politics and culture with a critical view of mainstream narratives. For example, Dissident Voice’s article on
[“Tucker Carlson and the JFK Allegations” ](https://dissidentvoice.org/2023/01/tucker-carlson-and-the-jfk-allegations/)critiques Carlson’s use of ambiguous terms like “involved,” which the author labels as a “weasel word” that can mean “something significant or nothing.” The piece leans towards the CIA’s involvement in JFK’s assassination but questions Carlson’s clarity. The author references a [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) YouTube video and cites [The Intercept](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/) to challenge [Tucker Carlson’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tucker-carlson-bias-rating/) anti-elite stance, highlighting his past elitist remarks. The article states, “…as if a Rupert Murdock-owned Fox TV host…has become the Julian Assange of corporate journalism.
A passage from the article “
[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: To Heal the Great Divide](https://dissidentvoice.org/2023/04/robert-f-kennedy-jr-to-heal-the-great-divide/)” shows a strong bias in favor of [RFK Jr](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-democratic-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/). It uses emotionally loaded language like “criminal enterprises” and “frauds” to describe various institutions and individuals. The article frames RFK Jr.’s views as “self-evident conclusions of a patriot,” suggesting they are undeniable truths. This framing is further emphasized by including conspiracy theories, such as the claim that the COVID-19 crisis is an “intelligence-run operation” and that Anthony Fauci is a “liar and fraud who fronts for Big Pharma.”
