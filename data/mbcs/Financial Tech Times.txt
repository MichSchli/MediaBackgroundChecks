Funded by / Ownership
The Grit Daily Media Group owns and publishes Financial Tech Times. Funding primarily comes from subscribers, advertisements, and sponsorships of their live events.
Analysis / Bias
Financial Tech Times publishes news and information related to the Financial Technologies industry. Articles and headlines are minimally biased in word choices, such as
[PawFury Launches $PawFactory with Live Presale of Up to 149% Bonus](https://financialtechtimes.com/pawfury-launches-pawfactory-with-live-presale-of-up-to-149-bonus/). Although not labeled promotional, it primarily emphasizes the product’s benefits and lacks critical balance.
Editorially, they do not produce op-eds; however, they do report on political issues related to the industry, like
[Warren Buffett’s Philanthropic Contributions Soar Past $51 Billion](https://financialtechtimes.com/warren-buffetts-contributions-51-billion/). In reviewing dozens, a slight majority of politically related pieces lean slightly left in favoring a liberal perspective. In general, they are fact-based, but the content sometimes blurs the lines by not indicating which stories are promotional.
