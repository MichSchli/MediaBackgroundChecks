Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features selected political news stories and op-eds from various news publications in addition to commentary from its own contributors. Though their own political views lean conservative, the site’s founders say their goal is to give readers “ideological diversity” in its commentary section. In reviewing their political news and opinions, there are slightly more that is published from right-leaning sources. However, both sides are represented. Real Clear Politics is known for its RCP Polling Average, which combines all polling data to create a statistical average.
Most of the news content on Real Clear Politics is aggregated from other sources such as
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/), [Salon,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/salon/) [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), [The Federalist](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/), and [National Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-review/). Several of the sources used by Real Clear Politics are listed as Mixed factual due to failed fact checks. For example, in this [article](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/10/04/whats_going_on_in_the_intelligence_community_ig_office_141412.html), the author claims that the Intelligence Community Inspector General must have a whistleblower complaint with “First Hand” information before it can be urgent and credible. [This is a false claim](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/10/no-hearsay-rule-change-for-whistleblowers/). In reviewing [original Real Clear Politics articles,](https://realclearpolitics.com/articles/) there is a right-leaning bias in wording and story selection, such as this: [Gov. Jerry ‘Moonbeam’ Brown’s Warning to Fellow Democrats.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/12/20/gov_jerry_moonbeam_browns_warning_to_fellow_democrats_138972.html) Although this is an opinion piece, it completely lacks sourcing of any kind. Generally, most stories from Real Clear Politics come from a right-leaning perspective.
