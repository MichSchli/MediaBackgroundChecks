Analysis / Bias
In review, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports local news through journalists with minimal loaded words and proper sourcing. National and World news come from various established left-center and least biased sources such as the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Editorially, according to [Ballotpedia,](https://ballotpedia.org/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette) the Post-Gazette always endorses Democratic candidates in Presidential elections. However, in 2016 they did not endorse either candidate, and in Pennsylvania elections, they favored mostly [Republican candidates](http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2016/10/31/2016-General-Election-Pittsburgh-Post-Gazette-editorial-board-endorsements/stories/201610310208), representing a shift in editorial direction. Further, in 2020 they [endorsed](https://thevillagereporter.com/america-first-mindset-toledo-blade-endorses-president-trump/) Republican Donald Trump for President. A thorough review of editorial columns indicates that they publish both sides; however, right-leaning opinion outweighs the left. Further, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette [fired](http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2018/06/14/Post-Gazetteeditorial-cartoonist-Rob-Rogers/stories/201806140152) a prominent political cartoonist who frequently portrayed Donald Trump negatively.
