Analysis / Bias
In review, the Cape Cod Times covers local news through the use of reporters and journalists with minimal bias in wording and story selection. National and international news is covered through the least biased
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). All information is properly sourced to credible media outlets or verifiable information. [Editorially](http://www.capecodtimes.com/opinion/editorials?start=2), there is a slight left-leaning bias favoring issues of the left, though mostly balanced with both points of view represented. A factual search reveals some [controversy](https://www.poynter.org/news/longtime-cape-cod-times-writer-karen-jeffrey-fabricated-sources-least-34-stories) regarding a journalist who did not properly list sources, but there isn’t evidence of any failed fact checks.
