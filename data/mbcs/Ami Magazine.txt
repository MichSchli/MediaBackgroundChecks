Analysis / Bias
[According](https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/for_ultra-orthodox_newspapers_women_and_the_web_present_growing_challenges.php) to a [Columbia Journalism Review](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/columbia-journalism-review/) article regarding Orthodox Jews, “the ultra-Orthodox publications do not run pictures of women in their pages. They don’t print women’s pictures.” Further, on same-sex marriage, Columbia Journalism Review reports, “Rabbi Frankfurter’s Ami ignored it altogether as if it never happened.” The Jewish Standard [reports](https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/haredi-newspaper-finds-modest-way-to-show-photo-of-hillary-clinton/) that if Hillary Clinton won the election, Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter said, “I think we’re going to have to rethink it.”
In 2012, during the Obama administration, Ami published a cover picture of the
[White House Draped In Nazi Flags](https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/depicting-nazi-flag-draped-white-house-was-insensitive-at-best/). Later, Frankfurter apologized, [stating](https://vosizneias.com/2012/01/14/new-york-ami-magazine-apologizes-for-picture-of-white-house-draped-in-nazi-flags/), “The White House was used as a symbol of the U.S. and not to suggest anything about the present administration or its occupants.”
[ In 2017,
](https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/depicting-nazi-flag-draped-white-house-was-insensitive-at-best/) [The Independent](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/)reported that Ami White House correspondent Jake Turx [asked](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-jewish-reporter-lying-sit-down-anti-semitism-question-jake-turx-white-house-press-a7585151.html)President Trump about rising Antisemitism, with Trump responding “Not a simple question. Not a fair question. OK, sit down. I understand the rest of your question”. Later, Jake Turx [told](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-dressing-down-jewish-reporter-defends-trump-against-anti-semitism-claims/) [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/), “It’s very unfair what’s been done to him, and I understand why he’s so defensive. And I’m with him when it comes to being outraged about him being charged with this Antisemitism.” Turx favorable response to Trump was [criticized](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-orthodox-jews-are-not-just-trumps-enablers-theyre-also-his-victims-1.5440861)by the left-leaning [Haaretz](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/haaretz/). When it comes to sourcing information, Ami often hyperlinks to themselves or uses quotes. They also republish [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/)articles.
On December 12, 2019, President Trump tweeted a poll that was conducted by Ami, showing strong support for him from the Jewish Orthodox community. However, Ami does not name the
[polling company](https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/trump-touts-poll-that-shows-him-with-massive-orthodox-jewish-support), the methodology, or the margin of error. They also conducted a similar poll in [2018](http://www.amimagazine.org/2018/08/01/trump-and-the-orthodox-jewish-community-an-independent-poll-by-ami-magazine/), which had similar results.
Typically most of Ami’s content consists of interviews such as
[“Impeach the President // Exclusive interview with Republican Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona”.](http://www.amimagazine.org/2019/11/06/impeach-the-president/) Although Ami is conservative, they do publish articles critical of former President Trump with loaded language in their headlines, such as [“Syrian Con Game // Putin, Assad and Iran pull a fast one on the Americans and Israelis in the continuing Syrian civil war](http://www.amimagazine.org/2018/07/11/syrian-con-game/). In general, Ami Magazine reports right-leaning news stories with a conservative Jewish Haredi Orthodox editorial stance.
