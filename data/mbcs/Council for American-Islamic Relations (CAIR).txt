History
[Founded in June 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American%E2%80%93Islamic_Relations) by [Nihad Awad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihad_Awad), the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with regional offices nationwide. According to their [about page](https://www.cair.com/about_us), “CAIR’s vision is to be a leading advocate for justice and mutual understanding. CAIR’s mission is to enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.” CAIR also lists its 10 core principles that you can read [here](https://www.cair.com/about_us). [Critics of CAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American%E2%80%93Islamic_Relations), such as the United Arab Emirates, have accused it of pursuing an Islamist agenda and have claimed that the group is connected to Hamas, and the Muslim Brotherhood, claims which CAIR has rejected and described as an Islamophobic smear campaign.

Funded by / Ownership
Until 2011, CAIR was a non-profit; however, in 2011, it
[lost its nonprofit status](https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2011/06/cair-loses-nonprofit-status-036984). According to research by [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), “A CAIR attorney initially told POLITICO that its appearance on the IRS list referred to a defunct arm of the nonprofit and that CAIR and CAIR foundation were unaffected — a claim that a review of the IRS documents did not support.” In 2013, CAIR was [reinstated](https://www.scribd.com/document/169513945/CAIR-F-2013-IRS-Reinstatement-Ex-10-to-Ex-A-OCR?ad_group=1726779&campaign=VigLink&content=27795&irgwc=1&keyword=ft500noi&medium=affiliate&source=impactradius) as a non-profit charity and remains so today.
CAIR is funded through donations from individuals as well as grants from organizations such as
[Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/rockefeller-philanthropy-advisors/) ($30,000 since 2008) and the [Tides Foundation](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/tides-foundation/) ($5,000 since 2002). [According](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/council-on-american-islamic-relations-cair/) to the right-leaning [Influence Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/influence-watch/), “In 2013, it was revealed that from approximately 2007 to 2012, CAIR, Inc., transferred $1.08 million to the CAIR Foundation. CAIR, Inc., disclosed in 2005 that it received a total of $1.2 million from six contributors in Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.” Further, CAIR has received $405,000 from the government of Qatar.
Analysis / Bias
In review, CAIR is primarily an Islamic civil rights advocacy group. However, they also produce Op-Eds that are published on their website. The Op-Eds utilize moderate loaded language in headlines such as this:
[Government’s Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Approach Continues to Single Out Muslims](https://www.cair.com/cair_islam_oped_government_s_countering_violent_extremism_cve_approach_continues_to_single_out_muslims). This article is strongly sourced to credible media outlets such as [Reason](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/), [Foreign Policy](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-policy/), [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), UK Parliament, [DefenseOne](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/defense-one/), and Georgetown University. However, they also link to the conspiracy website [Global Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/global-research/). In another Op-Ed titled, [CAIR: Columnist’s Anti-Islam Diatribe Ignores Words of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad](https://www.cair.com/cair_columnists_anti_islam_diatribe_ignores_words_of_the_quran_and_prophet_muhammad), there isn’t a single source listed with the exception of quotes from the Quran.
CAIR has faced numerous allegations and criticisms over its history. In 2014, CAIR was designated a terrorist organization by the
[United Arab Emirates](http://wam.ae/en/details/1395272478814) due to alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. CAIR responded by calling the move “shocking and bizarre,” and In January 2015, CAIR said it would seek to [appeal](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/two-groups-on-uae-terror-list-set-to-appeal-1.122198) the designation in the UAE. Further, the USA has not designated them as a [terrorist organization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/11/17/why-the-u-a-e-is-calling-2-american-groups-terrorists/).
Several academics and conservative-leaning politicians have accused CAIR of being a
[Muslim Brotherhood affiliate](https://capro.info/Cults_and_Isms/Islam/PDFs/The_Muslim_Brotherhood_in_the_United-States-Steve_Merley.pdf) in the United States. CAIR has [rejected](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/republican-calls-cair-hamas-linked-terrorist-group-170210134359010.html) such associations as a smear campaign. [The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) has said [CAIR is](https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/israel-international/israel--middle-east/Profile-The-Council-on-American-Islamic-Relations.pdf) “undermined by its anti-Israel agenda [which]… dates back to its founding by leaders of the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), a Hamas affiliated anti-Semitic propaganda organization.”
Lastly, some Muslims have claimed that CAIR holds
[conservative views](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14cair.html) of women, suggesting they wear a veil.
CAIR has also received
[positive praise](https://web.archive.org/web/20170903035752/http://www.cairchicago.org/blog/2013/05/2013-public-endorsements/) for its advocacy work, civil rights work, and for its involvement in the communities, it serves. Further, CAIR [works with the FBI](https://www.fpri.org/article/2011/12/muslim-brotherhood-organizations-in-america-goals-ideologies-and-strategies/) as an ally in counter-terrorism operations.
In general, CAIR promotes a left-leaning view regarding civil rights; however, they hold stronger right-leaning views when it comes to
[secularism;](https://www.cair.com/author_cair_represents_views_of_mainstream_muslims) instead advocating for conservative religious doctrine. This reliance on religious doctrine causes CAIR to have mixed views on topics such as [evolution,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_views_on_evolution) where some accept Darwin’s theory (consensus of science) and others don’t.
