History
Citizen Free Press does not have an about page, disclaimer, or information regarding who is behind the website. A
[Whois search](http://whois.domaintools.com/citizenfreepress.com) shows the domain was registered privately in 2016. We can glean from the website that [Kane](https://www.citizenfreepress.com/author/admin/) is the admin and publishes all the articles.

Funded by / Ownership
Again, Citizen Free Press does not disclose financial or ownership information, and there does not appear to be a means of revenue generation.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Citizen Free Press only does two things: link to other right-biased news stories or publish their own, often with minimal dialogue that relies on video or tweet sourcing. When publishing their own stories, they often use loaded emotional headlines such as this:
[Black MSNBC Pundit Feels The HEAT After Making Light of Mollie Tibbetts’ Murder…](https://www.citizenfreepress.com/breaking/msnbc-pundit-deletes-twitter-account-after-making-light-of-mollie-tibbetts-murder/)
When linking to outside sources, they mostly utilize right-leaning media. Many are rated Mixed for factual reporting, such as
[Lifezette](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lifezette/) and [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/), and some Questionable, such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) and conspiracy website [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). They mostly link to mainstream sources as long as they support the right and/or denigrate the left.
