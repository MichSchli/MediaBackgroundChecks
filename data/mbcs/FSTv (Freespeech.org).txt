Analysis / Bias
In review, all shows on Free Speech TV have a left-wing bias and may have guests who are not factual. Their primary news shows are the Thom Hartmann Program,
[Democracy Now!](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/democracy-now/) and [France 24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/). Democracy Now! has a left-wing bias in reporting but is considered factual. France 24 is considered a Least Biased source by our methodology, but also factual.
Headlines of articles typically contain loaded emotional language such as this:
[Did Trump’s Lie-Filled Anti-Immigrant Scaremongering Work?](https://freespeech.org/stories/did-trumps-lie-filled-anti-immigrant-scaremongering-work/) and [Arizona Activists Face Jail Time for Providing Life-Saving Aid to Migrants Crossing Sonoran Desert.](https://freespeech.org/stories/arizona-activists-face-jail-time-for-providing-life-saving-aid-to-migrants-crossing-sonoran-desert/) Neither of the two articles above contains sourcing of any kind outside of the video they link to. In fact, most information on this website is not sourced or comes from transcripts or video links from hosts such as Thom Hartmann, who has made [false claims](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/19/thom-hartmann/does-keystone-xl-promise-100-billion-profit-koch-b/) in the past. In general, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right. There is also poor use of sourcing as well.
