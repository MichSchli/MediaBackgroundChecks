Analysis / Bias
AND Magazine generally presents news and opinion articles from a conservative perspective and uses loaded language in their content and headlines. The article
[“Time To Stop Covering For Joe”](https://andmagazine.com/talk/2022/02/08/time-to-stop-covering-for-joe/) is a negatively worded view of President Joe Biden and the media’s coverage of his presidency, such as referring to him as “this ‘President.'” The complete statement is: “This ‘President’ failed our men and women in uniform in Kabul just as he failed the entire nation.”
Another article titled
[“Has A U.S. Funded Bio Lab In Kazakhstan Been Breached?”](https://andmagazine.com/talk/2022/01/10/has-a-u-s-funded-bio-lab-in-kazakhstan-been-breached/) cites unverified social media posts, which at the time of the review, no longer exist, as well as statements from local officials and a report from [Russian News Agency-TASS,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russian-news-agency-tass/) which is not a credible source. While the article attempts to answer the question posed in the title, the evidence presented is inconclusive.
AND Magazine cites a range of sources in their articles, including mainstream outlets such as the
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Popular Science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/popular-science/) and less credible sources like [Russian News Agency-TASS](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russian-news-agency-tass/). In addition, they have cited social media posts that were unavailable at the time of our review and websites that have not been evaluated for reliability, such as williambowles.info and armswatch.com.
Regarding science, they have promoted pseudoscience, such as in this article
[Doctors And Researchers TRY To Get Past Media AND #TechTyrant Censors – “HCQ Works…”](https://andmagazine.com/talk/2020/08/12/doctors-and-researchers-try-to-get-past-media-and-techtyrant-sensors-hcq-works/) This is false as many studies, [including double-blind studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34083403/), indicate “hydroxychloroquine did not improve survival or length of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.” Further, the primary sources for this article are the Questionable [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/) and anti-vaccine organization [America’s Frontline Doctors](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/americas-frontline-doctors/). In general, AND Magazine holds a strong right-leaning editorial bias and has promoted unproven conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
