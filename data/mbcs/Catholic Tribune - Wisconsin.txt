History
The Catholic Tribune – Wisconsin is a conservative news and opinion website and print newspaper published by
[Metric Media LLC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/metric-media/) that is designed to look like a local news source. Metric Media publishes over 1000 websites with the same design and about page that reads, “Metric Media was established to fill the void in community news after years of decline in local reporting by legacy media. Our approach is to provide objective, data-driven information without political bias. We provide 100% original reporting, including sharing as much data as possible from government and other publicly available sources.”
Metric Media LLC lacks transparency as they do not have an about page that describes its conservative agenda nor discloses funding and ownership.
