Analysis / Bias
In review, Political Wire features short blog entries by Taegan Goddard covering current political news. The website also has links to three different resources. First is the
[Political Job Hunt,](https://www.politicaljobhunt.com/) which helps build a career in politics. Second, is the [Political Dictionary,](https://politicaldictionary.com/) which defines terms such as “alternative facts” and “gaslighting.” Lastly, is the [Electoral Vote Map,](https://electoralvotemap.com/) which keeps a current tally of where the electoral college stands according to the [Cook Political Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cook-political-report/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fivethirtyeight/).
A review of blog posts demonstrates the publication of political news stories with very few loaded words, such as this:
[Warren Claimed Indian Heritage for the State of Texas Bar](https://politicalwire.com/2019/02/05/warren-claimed-indian-heritage-for-the-state-of-texas-bar/) and [Virginia Attorney General Also Wore Blackface](https://politicalwire.com/2019/02/06/virginia-attorney-general-also-wore-blackface/). All stories are sourced back to the original article, such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [The Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/). In general, all free content on this website is low-biased and properly sourced, covering both sides of politics. However, we do not have access to paid content that contains more in-depth original writing.
