History
Founded in 2004, RedState is a conservative news and opinion website. Until 2015, conservative radio and TV commentator Erick Erickson was editor-in-chief. The website does not have an about page and does not list a current editor.
[In 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedState), three senior contributors for RedState resigned after they noticed that they did not promote articles critical of President Trump via social media. In an article for [The Bulwark.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-bulwark/), titled [Why We Are Quitting RedState](https://thebulwark.com/why-we-are-quitting-redstate/), Kimberly Ross and Andrea Ruth stated that “it’s hard not to note the irony that Salem Media, a company that targets “audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content and conservative values,” threw its full support behind Donald Trump, a thrice-married lying philanderer who utilized bankruptcy laws and debt to con tenants and contractors out of their money. Salem now promotes anyone who is pro-Trump, even if those people gleefully flout Christian principles.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, RedState is a conservative news and opinion website that publishes content with a borderline extreme right-wing bias. Nearly every article utilizes strongly emotional wording such as this:
[The Press Screwed The Pooch Covering The Collusion Hoax So Why Are They Congratulating Themselves](https://www.redstate.com/streiff/2019/04/20/press-screwed-pooch-covering-collusion-hoax-congratulating/). Sourcing on this article is poor. In another extremely loaded emotional article, [Dispatches From The Democratic Clown Show- 2020,](https://www.redstate.com/diary/davenj1/2019/04/20/dispatches-democratic-clown-show-2020/) the author disclaims, “This article is intentionally satirical and farcical, but sadly has shreds of truth sprinkled throughout.” As mentioned above, RedState publishes daily propaganda supporting Former President Trump, with little regard for facts such as this: [President Trump: Mueller Report Contains Some Statements That Are ‘Total Bulls**T, Fabricated.’](https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2019/04/19/president-trump-mueller-report-contains-statements-total-bullst-fabricated/) While this may be true or untrue, there is zero proof to back the President’s assertions. In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left with extremely loaded emotional language.
