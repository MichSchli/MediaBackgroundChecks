History
The Politics Online is an anti-Islam website that does not have an about page, author information, or ownership disclosure. In other words, the Owner(s) of the website wishes to remain anonymous as their content is Questionable. The website is part of a network of up to 14 websites that promotes anti-Muslim propaganda through an anonymous
[Anti-Muslim Network](https://api.newsguardtech.com/label/freespeechfront.net?cid=04dab292-85f2-47b6-b18c-097b097f9da8). According to a [Guardian investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/06/inside-the-hate-factory-how-facebook-fuels-far-right-profit) in 2019, the network also features up to 21 Facebook pages that amplify the content reaching millions.
Due to the anonymous nature of these websites, they lack transparency. Further, the domains of sources within the network change frequently, and therefore some of these sites may not be online all the time.
Funded by / Ownership
The websites in the network do not disclose ownership, and advertising generates revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Politics Online appears to change its domain name frequently to avoid detection as a fake propaganda news website. The sole purpose of this website is to denigrate Muslims through negative news reporting and loaded headlines such as this:
[Not a single American flag in sight at US Muslim congresswoman’s Anti-Israel rally in Detroit.](http://www.thepolitics.online/2019/05/not-single-american-flag-in-sight-at-us.html) There is zero sourcing for this story. Here is another anti-Muslim article: [Ben Shapiro humiliating Muslim Congresswomen over their despicable Pro-Hamas agenda against Israel.](http://www.thepolitics.online/2019/05/ben-shapiro-humiliating-muslim.html) Again, not a single hyperlink to support their claims. In general, this is a 100% anti-Muslim website that would qualify as a hate group if they had any credibility, which they don’t, based on the reasoning listed above.
