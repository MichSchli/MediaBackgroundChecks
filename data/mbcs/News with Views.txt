Analysis / Bias
In review, News with Views mostly publishes opinion commentary framed around news stories and events. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional headlines such as this
[Slippery Kamala Harris loses big to Vice President Pence](https://newswithviews.com/slippery-kamala-harris-loses-big-to-vice-president-pence/). This obvious opinion piece is not sourced at all and concludes with this emotional opinion “The left is ashamed of America, resents it, lies about our history, and plans to ‘kill us softly.’ “Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s leadership, America will become a Godless, hollow and ashamed shell of itself, full of danger, high taxation, immorality, riots and voided freedoms. Vote for America, God, and freedom. Vote for Donald Trump and Mike Pence.” There is not much to say about the bias of this website and the lack of sourcing speaks volumes about the veracity of facts.
