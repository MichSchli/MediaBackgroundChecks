Analysis / Bias
In review, this website serves one purpose and that is to discredit and defame David Hogg. Virtually, every story published is a debunked conspiracy theory related to David Hogg or gun control. Generally, the sources for these articles are other very questionable sources such as
[Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). All articles contain excessive loaded emotional language such as: [It’s all THEATER: Florida high school shooting survivor caught on video rehearsing scripted lines, coached by camera man](http://www.hoggwatch.com/2018-02-19-its-all-theater-florida-high-school-shooting-survivor-caught-on-video-rehearsing-scripted-lines-coached-by-camera-man.html). The conspiracy theory that David Hogg is a crisis actor was [debunked](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/feb/21/blog-posting/why-you-shouldnt-believe-claims-stoneman-high-stud/) immediately by multiple sources. Essentially, every story on this website is either not factual or misleading.
Mike Adams is known as the
[Health Ranger](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/NaturalNews), according to [Rationalwiki](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rationalwiki/). However, they point out dozens of cases where his claims are false. Besides promoting pseudoscience, Hogg Watch is an extreme right-wing biased source that frequently promotes false or misleading information regarding vaccines, alternative health, and government conspiracies.

In general, politically, all of Mike Adam’s stories favor the right and promote pseudoscience such as
[chemtrails](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-chemtrails/), the Sandy Hook shooting being a false flag: [Sandy Hook was theater! Actor who played law enforcement sniper was recorded walking around carrying rifle by the magazine](https://www.newstarget.com/2016-07-07-sandy-hook-was-theater-actor-who-played-law-enforcement-sniper-was-recorded-walking-around-carrying-rifle-by-the-magazine.html). Further, they routinely publish [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) and conspiracy theories. Lastly, this source denies the consensus on [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) without evidence, as seen here: [Climate change cultists are now taking over your local weather forecast.](https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-05-09-climate-change-cultists-are-now-taking-over-your-local-weather-forecast.html)
