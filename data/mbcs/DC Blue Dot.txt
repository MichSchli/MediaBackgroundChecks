History
[Founded in late 2018](http://whois.domaintools.com/dcbluedot.com), DC Blue Dot is a strongly left leaning news and opinion website. According to their vague [about page](http://www.dcbluedot.com/about/) “DCBluedot.com was launched to fill a rather large void online with political media publications, specifically in the progressive news space. We desire to be a place where you can find news that is relevant to your progressive ideals.” DC Blue Dot publishes news from a variety of authors, but none have a bio or credentials listed.

Analysis / Bias
In review, DC Blue Dot is a hyper-partisan website that always favors the left through story selection and wording such as this:
[Trump gets greeted with a scathing billboard near his house](http://www.dcbluedot.com/trump-gets-greeted-with-a-scathing-billboard-near-his-house/). This sensational story is sourced to the factually mixed [Daily Kos](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-kos/). In another loaded story “ [Trump is melting down so hard that it sounds like he thinks he’s toast.](http://www.dcbluedot.com/trump-is-melting-down-so-hard-that-it-sounds-like-he-thinks-hes-toast/)“, there is proper sourcing to the [Atlantic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/), but the wording within the article [strays from reality](http://www.dcbluedot.com/trump-is-melting-down-so-hard-that-it-sounds-like-he-thinks-hes-toast/), not necessarily in a factual sense, but clearly in an overtly sensational sense that is only derived from biased speculation: “If you don’t believe that fear is real, just take a look at how sweaty he was when he went on a profane tirade while speaking of Mueller.” This type of statement is a conspiracy.
