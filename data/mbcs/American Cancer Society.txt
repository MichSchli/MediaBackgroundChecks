Analysis / Bias
The American Cancer Society provides educational resources to patients and caregivers, funds cancer research, publishes peer-reviewed journals and provides fact-based information regarding cancer on the website. For example, they have a section on the website called
[Cancer A-Z](https://www.cancer.org/cancer.html) that provides “information about cancer and its causes to in-depth information on specific cancer types – including risk factors, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment options.”
The website also provides cancer-related news from a pro-science, low-biased perspective such as this
[Smoking Rates Historically Low, but Other Cancer-related Behaviors Need Improvement](https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/acs-report-smoking-rates-historically-low-but-other-cancer-related-behaviors-need-improvement.html). We could not find any instances of the ACS directly reporting on politics. In general, they are low-biased, fact-based, and pro-science.
