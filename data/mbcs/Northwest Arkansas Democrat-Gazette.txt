In review, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette covers local news through reporters with minimal bias in wording such as this,
[Covid-19 deaths, cases increase in Northwest Arkansas](https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2020/jun/13/covid-19-deaths-cases-increase-in-northwest/). National and international news is produced by the [Associated Press](https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2020/jun/13/covid-19-deaths-cases-increase-in-northwest/) and the parent Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
Editorially, the opinion page slightly favors the right with stories such as this
