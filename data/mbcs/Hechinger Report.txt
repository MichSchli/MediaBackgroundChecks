Analysis / Bias
The Hechinger Report produces in-depth reports, analyses, and commentary on education ranging from early childhood through adult education. Articles and headlines utilize loaded emotional wording that usually favors the left, such as this
[The racist and sexist roots of child care in America explain why the system is in shambles](https://hechingerreport.org/the-racist-and-sexist-roots-of-child-care-in-america-explain-why-the-system-is-in-shambles/). The articles reviewed were primarily sourced from first-person quotes, while analysis-type stories relied on hyperlinks from credible sources such as [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [The Atlantic,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-atlantic/) and government databases. Further, their articles are frequently republished by credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and the [Boston Globe](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/boston-globe/).
Editorially, the Hechinger Report focuses on how education is affected by poverty, racism, and sexism, such as this
[A school created a homeless shelter in the gym, and it paid off in the classroom](https://hechingerreport.org/a-shelter-in-a-school-gym-for-students-experiencing-homelessness-paid-off-in-classrooms/). Further, the website covers climate change, immigration, and social-emotional learning from a liberal perspective, such as this [TEACHER VOICE: Social and emotional learning is helping close equity gaps at my school](https://hechingerreport.org/teacher-voice-social-and-emotional-learning-is-helping-close-equity-gaps-at-my-school/). Finally, they frequently report negatively on conservatives, especially regarding critical race theory [COLUMN: If you don’t want critical race theory to exist, stop being racist](https://hechingerreport.org/column-if-you-dont-want-critical-race-theory-to-exist-stop-being-racist/). In general, The Hechinger Report is fact-based and holds a left-leaning editorial bias.
