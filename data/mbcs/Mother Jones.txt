Analysis / Bias
Although Mother Jones’s political inclinations have been described as progressive, they did not
[endorse](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/lets-talk-politics-and-reporting/) any political party during the 2016 presidential election. They have published articles with an anti-Bernie Sanders tone, such as this [article](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/09/bernie-sanders-comes-face-to-face-with-the-hack-gap/), “Poor Bernie Sanders has fallen victim to the hack gap.” Other left-leaning publications have criticized this stance as [“Mother Jones’ Legacy Is Haunting Mother Jones as the Magazine Embraces Neoliberalism.”](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/12/the-legacy-of-mother-jones-is-haunting-mother-jone.html) However, Hillary Clinton has also been critical with this article: [Let’s Cut the Crap About Why Hillary Clinton Lost](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/06/lets-cut-crap-about-why-hillary-clinton-lost/).
Mother Jones frequently publishes detailed investigative journalism such as “
[The full data set from our in-depth investigation into mass shootings.”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) This investigation has been [criticized](https://reason.com/blog/2014/10/16/mother-jones-claims-the-rate-of-mass-sho) by some on the right, such as [Reason.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/).
In review, some articles we analyzed offer support for Republicans, such as
[“This Deep-Red State Decided to Make a Serious Investment in Preschools. It’s Paying Off Big-Time”,](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/01/alabama-serious-investment-pre-k-education-paying-off/) by praising Lawmakers such as [Jeana Ross](https://governor.alabama.gov/cabinet/department-of-early-childhood-education/), Republican Secretary for the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education, and Alabama state Senator [Trip Pittman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_Pittman) for their accomplishments in the state preschool program. On the other hand, they also have other articles we reviewed that have emotionally loaded headlines that are negative toward Republicans, such as “ [Patriots Games, Birthday Bashes, and Vicious Tweets: Trump and Romney’s Failed Bromance.” ](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/patriots-games-birthday-bashes-and-vicious-tweets-trump-and-romneys-failed-bromance/)
In general, story selection moderately favors the left, although the progressive left tends to be criticized more often than the establishment left. When it comes to sourcing, Mother Jones sources credible media outlets such as
[Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/), [NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), [Time Magazine,](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/time/) [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/), [Washington Examiner](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/), and [C-Span.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/c-span/)
