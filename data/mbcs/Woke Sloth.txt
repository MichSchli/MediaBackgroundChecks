Analysis / Bias
In review, Woke Sloth is a left biased news and opinion website that frequently uses loaded emotional sensational headlines such as this:
[Trump Is Whining That He’s Home Alone On Christmas Eve](https://wokesloth.com/trump-whining-home-alone-christmas-eve/lindseyweedston/). Woke Sloth does not produce original news content, but rather takes news stories and adds commentary to them that is favorable to the left and denigrating to the right. For example, this: “Maybe running for President wasn’t the best idea in the world. As it turns out, you actually have responsibilities and can’t take golf vacations whenever you want. The good news is that the President can resign whenever he wants and go back to running businesses into the ground instead of the entire country.”
When it comes to sourcing, Woke Sloth usually publishes
[Tweets](https://wokesloth.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-says-congress-shouldnt-be-paid-during-shutdowns/stefan/) and then opines about them. Woke Sloth also frequently sources back to themselves from previous articles. In general, all stories on this website favor the left and utilize sensational or [misleading headlines](https://wokesloth.com/trump-blank-bill-ddt/daily-dot/).
