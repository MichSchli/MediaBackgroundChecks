Analysis / Bias
In the past, virtually every article/video is positive toward right-leaning positions and negative towards the left. For example, BPS promoted the
[fake conspiracy](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/09/07/no-there-is-no-evidence-that-hillary-clinton-has-parkinsons-disease/) that Hillary Clinton has [Parkinson’s Disease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INqeoYJy76s) during the election of 2016. They also promote the conspiracy that George Soros is behind funding everything anti-right: [George SOROS: The One-Man Illuminati Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feGXIK--OdM). Other than promoting conspiracies they also advocate for the [Men’s Rights Movement](http://blackpigeonspeaks.com/2017/03/forgetting-men-in-the-name-of-female-empowerment/) ( [anti-feminism](http://blackpigeonspeaks.com/2017/03/forgetting-men-in-the-name-of-female-empowerment/)). They also have categories that rail against [Islam](http://blackpigeonspeaks.com/category/editorial/islam/) and [Black Lives Matter](http://blackpigeonspeaks.com/category/editorial/blm/).
[According](https://shorensteincenter.org/anatomy-of-alt-right-youtuber/) to the [Shorenstein Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shorenstein-center/), “BPS’s worldview overlaps with older ideas from many diverse movements and ideologies such as white nationalism, neo-Nazism, anti-Semitism, conservatism, classical liberalism, libertarianism, and Christian conservatism.”
Finally, in a report by the Soufan Center titled
[WHITE SUPREMACY EXTREMISM: The Transnational Rise of the Violent White Supremacist Movement,](https://thesoufancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Report-by-The-Soufan-Center-White-Supremacy-Extremism-The-Transnational-Rise-of-The-Violent-White-Supremacist-Movement.pdf) “BPS produces videos that contain themes and imagery often associated with white nationalism and anti-feminism, and its comment boards are saturated with anti-Semitic overtones. According to BPS, BPS was briefly deleted and demonetized by YouTube, which took to Twitter to bemoan the enforcement action.”
