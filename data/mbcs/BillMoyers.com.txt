Analysis / Bias
In review, BillMoyers.com mainly publishes commentary that favors the liberal and progressive left. Articles and headlines often contain loaded emotional wording, such as this
[America’s Dirty Divide: How Environmental Racism Leaves the Vulnerable Behind](https://billmoyers.com/story/americas-dirty-divide-how-environmental-racism-leaves-the-vulnerable-behind/). The story is republished from the factually mixed [Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/). Other articles are written by reporters, such as [The Difference Between Yelling Fire and Setting One](https://billmoyers.com/story/the-difference-between-yelling-fire-and-setting-one/). For the most part, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right, and are reasonably sourced.
Editorially, all stories favor the left. However, during the 2020 election, we did find evidence of misleading information such as this
[Stamp Out the Trump Attacks on Our Postal Service!](http://web.archive.org/web/20201103142753/https:/billmoyers.com/story/stamp-out-the-trump-attacks-on-our-postal-service/) This was debunked here [Postmaster General Defends His Actions In Acrimonious Marathon House Hearing](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/24/904435736/watch-postmaster-general-dejoy-testifies-in-house-oversight-hearing). In general, the news is reported factually with a significant liberal/progressive bias.
