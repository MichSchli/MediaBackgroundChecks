Analysis / Bias
Reporters Without Borders has
[reported](https://rsf.org/en/iran) Iran as “One of the most oppressive countries” According to a Reporters Without Borders 2022 report, Iran ranks 178 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
According to the
[PBS Iran media guide](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/media-guide.html), the Tehran Times is pro-government.
In review, the content of headlines and articles use loaded words about national news, such as
[“General: U.S. will become aware of Iran’s capabilities when it’s late”](http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/423132/General-U-S-will-become-aware-of-Iran-s-capabilities-when-it-s) and [ “Iran threatens to exit nuclear deal if talks become a ‘waste of time.”](http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/424003/Iran-threatens-to-exit-nuclear-deal-if-talks-become-a-waste) Further, they poorly source their articles by either heavily quoting or utilizing Questionable Iranian sources such as [Tasnim](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/tasnim-news-agency/) and their own news agency, Mehr. In general, the Tehran Times promotes state propaganda and conspiracy theories as they have no other choice.
