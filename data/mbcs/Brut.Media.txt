Analysis / Bias
Brut covers international news and politics through video production. Videos and headlines often contain moderately loaded language that favors the left, such as this
[AOC on violence against Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women](https://www.brut.media/us/news/aoc-on-violence-against-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-2292e5d5-9010-4524-ab3e-c02ba35baf63). Most videos are originally produced and rely on first-person accounts, which is acceptable from a sourcing standpoint.
Editorially, most videos align with the progressive left through videos that portray conservatives negatively, such as this
[These Conservatives Oppose Restrictive Abortion Laws](https://www.brut.media/us/news/these-conservatives-oppose-restrictive-abortion-laws-4cb005c2-a98b-4240-9fb8-2e0c68674955). In reviewing numerous videos, many promote social justice, environmentalism with concern for climate change and racial inequalities. They also hold negative views of capitalism, comparing it to addiction, [The business of addiction](https://www.brut.media/us/news/the-business-of-addiction-ca4ca5a8-41f4-4a52-b454-5a1749013053). Finally, the website publishes interviews with political leaders and advocates who mostly align with the progressive left. In general, Brut publishes mostly fact-based content but lacks transparency by not disclosing their progressive left bias.
