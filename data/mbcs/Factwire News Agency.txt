Analysis / Bias
In review, Factwire does not use loaded language at all and publishes thoroughly researched information. All information is properly sourced and demonstrates minimal bias as all sides are covered. We also could not find evidence of any failed fact checks; therefore, this source is least biased and high for factual reporting.
This source appears minimally active since China took over Hong Kong politically in 2021.
