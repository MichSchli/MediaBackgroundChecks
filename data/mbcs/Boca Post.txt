Analysis / Bias
Boca Post publishes a mix of local events, crime reports, and police activities in Boca Raton. For example, an article titled
[“UPDATE: What The Woman Found In Suitcases Floating In Delray Beach Intracoastal May Have Looked Like”](https://bocapost.com/news/florida/palm-beach-county/delray-beach-news/what-the-woman-found-in-suitcases-floating-in-delray-beach-intracoastal-may-have-looked-like/) lacks direct external sources or official police confirmations but indicates it was “originally reported by Boca Post,” suggesting that the news outlet might have had direct communication or access to police reports or statements.
Another piece detailing health inspections at Chop’s Lobster Bar, “
[DIRTY Dining Chop’s Lobster Bar Still Pending A Passing Health Inspection Following Closures,’](https://bocapost.com/news/florida/palm-beach-county/boca-news/dirty-dining-chops-lobster-bar-still-pending-a-passing-health-inspection-following-closures/) provides specific details without linking to the primary sources. For instance, it mentions specific dates of inspections, the number of violations found, and the nature of these violations, such as mold in the ice freezer, food safety concerns, insects, and more. However, there are no direct hyperlinks or references to external sources, such as the Department of Health reports or official inspection documents, which are readily available [here](https://data.tallahassee.com/restaurant-inspections/palm-beach/chops-lobster-bar/sea6019773/3353170/). The article does not use sensational or biased language.
An outreach article,
[“Be A Hero: Donors Needed For Boca Dad With A Rare Blood Cancer,”](https://bocapost.com/events/be-a-hero-donors-needed-for-boca-dad-with-a-rare-blood-cancer/) emphasizes rallying community support and understandably lacks external citations as the primary focus is on the human aspect and the call to action. The mention of the Jewish Education Center of South Florida Donor Drive lends credibility to the event details provided.
In general, the Boca Post is minimally biased in reporting and fact-based. However, they do not link to external sources, making it difficult to verify the facts. While they do state the primary sources used in their reports, such as the local police and public records, it requires the reader to manually search the information they reference.
