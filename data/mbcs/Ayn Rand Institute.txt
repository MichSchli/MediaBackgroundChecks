[“campus,”](https://courses.aynrand.org/campus-courses/) where they provide educational experiences to promote objectivism with courses like “Objectivist Epistemology,” and “Objectivism’s Approach to the Virtue.” Under the category “Works & Talks,” ARI provides Ayn Rand’s letters and her written work and the works of other Objectivist authors. They also publish [Research](https://ari.aynrand.org/faq/) through essays by authors and philosophers such as Leonard Peikoff and Tara Smith.
Bias
In review, the Ayn Rand Institute publishes stories like
[“Industrial Capitalism Protects Us from Climate-Related Risks,”](https://newideal.aynrand.org/industrial-capitalism-protects-us-from-climate-related-risks/) which claims that industrial capitalism has done more to fight climate change than government regulations. This article is republished from the [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) denialist organization, [The Heartland Institute.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heartland-institute/) Politically, ARI does not hold a favorable view of former President Trump, as evidenced by this article, [“The Anti-intellectuality Of Donald Trump: Why Ayn Rand Would Have Despised A President Trump.”](https://ari.aynrand.org/the-anti-intellectuality-of-donald-trump-why-ayn-rand-would-have-despised-a-president-trump/) A quote from the article reads, “Trump makes no distinction between truth and falsity, between statements backed by evidence and statements unsupported by any evidence. This is why you can’t catch him in a lie. He doesn’t care.”
ARI also is not a fan of President Biden and his policies as evidenced by this story
[Critiquing the Philosophic Ideas Shaping Biden’s Agenda](https://newideal.aynrand.org/critiquing-the-philosophic-ideas-shaping-bidens-agenda/). A quote from this article uses strongly loaded language “Biden’s agenda is powered by destructive ideas that will take America further down the path of collectivism.” When it comes to science, they report accurately on Covid-19, though they question how much a role the [government](https://newideal.aynrand.org/unjust-mask-mandates-distract-from-real-pandemic-priorities/) should play. Further, ARI accepts that climate change is occurring and influenced by humans; however, they do not support government regulations to slow global warming, believing [free-market capitalism](https://newideal.aynrand.org/the-green-new-deal-a-war-against-energy-part-1/) will regulate it better. Finally, they directly republish content from known climate denialists that are primarily funded by the fossil fuel industry. In general, they promote Libertarianism and sometimes use poor sources.
