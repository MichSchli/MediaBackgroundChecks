Formerly, Democrats, Diamond and Silk changed their party affiliation to Republican in 2015, so they could vote for Donald Trump in the North Carolina primary and general election.
The sisters have published a best-selling book and have a show called the
[Crystal Clear Show](https://www.newsmaxtv.com/Shows/Diamond-and-Silk-Crystal-Clear) on [Newsmax TV](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsmax-bias-credibilty-reliability/).

According to their
[about page](https://www.diamondandsilkinc.com/about-us/), they state “Standing with the Silent Majority, as Conservative women, they voice their opinions about media bias and repetitive political tactics that Americans are tired of being subjected to. Diamond and Silk are not politically correct; they are politically direct.”

Analysis / Bias
On the Diamond and Silk
[about page](https://www.diamondandsilkinc.com/about-us/), they make clear they are strong supporters of former President Trump: “Diamond and Silk are devoted supporters of President Donald Trump. During his first term as President, he has proven to be a leader who takes action and does not go missing in action. He has done more for all Americans, including black Americans, than any other President in history. President Trump’s non-traditional approach is what this country needed.”
The website generally features videos from their Chit Chat Live show and occasional news and commentary articles such as this
[Rep. Lauren Boebert Authors Legislation to Shut Down Biden’s Disinformation Board](https://www.diamondandsilkinc.com/tabletalknews/diamond-and-silk-rep-lauren-boebert-authors-legislation-to-shut-down-bidens-disinformation-board-kiuh6). A content review reveals that they rely on poor sources such as [resistthemainstream.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/resist-the-mainstream-bias/) and [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
Editorially, all stories and opinion content favor the conservative right and former President Trump while denigrating Democrats, such as this
[House Republicans Publish Video on Biden’s Crime Crisis](https://www.diamondandsilkinc.com/tabletalknews/diamond-and-silk-house-republicans-publish-video-on-bidens-crime-crisis-mjuv7). While some content on the website is fact-based, many stories are false or misleading. For example, in 2020, they were [fired](https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-cuts-ties-with-diamond-and-silk) from [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news-bias/) after spreading false conspiracy theories regarding Covid-19.
Further, they have spread numerous false claims regarding the January 6th Capitol Riot and election fraud conspiracies such as this “What was the legal reason for stopping the voting on election night? You know that everything all of a sudden came to a screeching halt. … And then how did everybody decide to stop all at the same time?”
[The voting did not come to a halt as claimed.](https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-debunking-several-claims?s=r) See more false claims below. In general, Diamond and Silk primarily promote the conspiracy theories of Donald Trump and his followers.
