Analysis / Bias
In 2021,
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Spain 29/180 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/spain) cautioning a rise in far-right parties. The Prime Minister of Spain is officially called the [“President of the Government”](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/06/actually-trump-was-right-to-call-rajoy-president-of-spain-sort-of/) (Presidente del Gobierno). The current Prime Minister of Spain is Pedro Sánchez, who leans [center-left.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-center-left-finds-life-in-spain) [Read our profile on Spain’s media and government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/spain-media-profile/)
[El Mundo](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-spanish-media-are-the-worst-in-europe-these-upstarts-are-trying-to-change-that/) is known for supporting conservative political views and being [center-right](https://cmds.ceu.edu/sites/cmcs.ceu.hu/files/attachment/basicpage/1632/mimspainfunding.pdf) on the political spectrum. Nieman Reports [states](https://niemanreports.org/articles/political-leanings-shape-newspaper-coverage/), “El Mundo despises the socialists and backs the governing conservative party, Partido Popular (PP).”
In review, El Mundo publishes articles with moderate, emotionally loaded language such as
[“The left also puts the flag of Spain on Twitter ](https://www.elmundo.es/f5/2020/07/23/5f1967effc6c83502a8b465e.html)“and [“Iranian Vox funders are former terrorists rehabilitated by checkbook.” ](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2019/01/24/5c48b358fc6c83b5218b46aa.html)Vox is Spain’s far-right party. When it comes to sourcing, El Mundo mostly sources itself. However, international coverage such as [“Vladimir Putin’s next challenge”](https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2020/07/26/5f1dd26721efa00f1c8b4614.html) utilizes both news agency material and foreign correspondents. In covering the USA, most articles are critical of the Trump administration, such as [“100 hard days for Donald Trump.](https://www.elmundo.es/opinion/editorial/2020/07/26/5f1c47d4fc6c836c6a8b457a.html)” El Mundo generally reports news factually and with a right-leaning editorial bias.
