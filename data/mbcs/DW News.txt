Analysis / Bias
In review, Deutsche Welle (DW) publishes articles with emotionally loaded language such as
[“Germany’s Angela Merkel seen shaking for third time within weeks](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-angela-merkel-seen-shaking-for-third-time-within-weeks/a-49535413).” They also publish equally critical articles about the German center-left SPD (coalition partner): [“German SPD’s record low in poll adds to strain on Merkel’s coalition”](https://www.dw.com/en/german-spds-record-low-in-poll-adds-to-strain-on-merkels-coalition/a-49222904) and [“Is socialism the future for Germany’s ailing SPD?”](https://www.dw.com/en/is-socialism-the-future-for-germanys-ailing-spd/a-49516665-0) On the issues, they report with the balance representing all sides, for example, with this [immigration article](https://www.dw.com/en/german-government-defends-planned-immigration-laws/a-48676952).
