Analysis / Bias
Defector primarily focuses on sports news but also delves into various political topics. The article
[“Trump Arraignment Only Seems Unprecedented”](https://defector.com/trump-arraignment-only-seems-unprecedented/) criticizes [Donald Trump](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/donald-trump-republican-presidential-candidate-bias-profile/) and cites credible sources such as the [New Republic](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-republic/), [Yahoo](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yahoo-news/), [USA Today](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/usa-today-2/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and [The Washington Pos](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)t, displaying a Left-Center bias.
Another article,
[“This Is Why Everybody Hates The Democrats,”](https://defector.com/this-is-why-everybody-hates-the-democrats/) is highly critical of the Democratic Party’s handling of the minimum wage issue. The article employs strong language, describing the Senate Parliamentarian as a “baloney made-up advisory office” and calls the parliamentarian an “unelected bureaucrat so anonymous and unimportant.” This language indicates a bias against the Democratic Party’s actions and the Senate’s procedural rules. The article cites [The Washington Pos](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/)t, further demonstrating a Left bias but with a critical tone toward the Democratic Party. In general, Defector is fact-based and holds a moderate left-leaning bias.
