Analysis / Bias
Dr. Robert Wallace Malone is an American physician and biochemist. His early work focused on mRNA technology, pharmaceuticals, and drug repurposing research. On his
[website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210824213429/https:/www.rwmalonemd.com/mrna-vaccine-inventor) and Twitter bio, Malone, calls himself the “inventor of mRNA vaccines.” [This is not true](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/the-development-of-mrna-vaccines-was-a-collaborative-effort-robert-malone-contributed-to-their-development-but-he-is-not-their-inventor/) “The development of the mRNA vaccines is due to the work of hundreds of researchers, one of which is Robert Malone.”
In 2021, Dr. Malone gained notoriety for his anti-vaccine positions related to the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. From 2021 until the present he has routinely promoted misinformation, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience related to the vaccine. For example, Malone promoted Ivermectin as an effective treatment for Covid-19:
[The War on Ivermectin](https://maloneinstitute.org/blog/the-war-on-ivermectin). Numerous double-blind studies, including this one: [Effect of Higher-Dose Ivermectin for 6 Days vs Placebo on Time to Sustained Recovery in Outpatients With COVID-19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2801827) demonstrate that Ivermectin has no impact on the treatment or prevention of Covid-19 infection.
Dr. Malone also promotes conspiracies related to the
[World Economic Forum (WEF)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/) and the so-called “Great Reset” such as this [Parasites: The Administrative State and the WEF](https://maloneinstitute.org/blog/parasites-the-administrative-state-and-the-wef). The [“Great Reset”](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/great-reset-conspiracy-flourishes-amid-continued-pandemic) is considered an unproven conspiracy theory. In general, Dr. Malone and the Malone Institute hold far-right biased views and often promote false and misleading information, as evidenced below in failed fact-checks.
