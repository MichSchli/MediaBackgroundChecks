Funded by / Ownership
On June 1, 2018, 38 North joined the Henry L.
[Stimson Center’s](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stimson-center/) East Asia Program. The South Korean Government initially funded it through the U.S. John Hopkins University’s Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, or KIEP. According to a Business Insider [article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-us-think-tank-on-korea-to-close-as-skorea-cuts-funds-2018-4), “The institute USKI had received about $1.8 million annually from the South Korean government”. [38 ](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/04/10/us-think-tank-on-korea-to-close-as-skorea-cuts-funds)North was an adjunct of the U.S.-Korea Institute (USKI). Boston.com reports that the South Korean government has terminated the U.S.-Korea Institute (USKI) funding through KIEP. South Korea’s reason for the closure has been [stated](https://saisobserver.org/2018/04/17/sais-think-tank-to-close-doors-after-12-years/) as a [“lack of transparency and sloppy management,”](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/839979.html) as [reported](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/839979.html) in South Korean papers. Further, the USKI director Jae H. Ku, Ph.D., is known for [conservative view](https://www.insidesources.com/ruckus-at-38-north/)s, which may have been a [factor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/korea-think-tank-at-us-university-to-close-after-seoul-withdraws-funding/2018/04/11/87adc3a8-3d64-11e8-912d-16c9e9b37800_story.html?utm_term=.0be3996eac90). This lack of transparency prompted the South Korean Government to cut its funding.
According to a Business Insider
[article,](https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-defunds-uski-38-north-2018-4) this lack of funding will not affect the website as 38 North has “alternative sources of funding.” On April 11, 2018, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) [announced](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/content/us-korea-institute-close-johns-hopkins-school-advanced-international-studies-sais) that “In May, the U.S.-Korea Institute (USKI) at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) will no longer be in operation and SAIS also stated the reason for the closure of the U.S.-Korea Institute(USKI) is due to the loss of funding from a major supporter.” The Washington Post [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/korea-think-tank-at-us-university-to-close-after-seoul-withdraws-funding/2018/04/11/87adc3a8-3d64-11e8-912d-16c9e9b37800_story.html?utm_term=.0be3996eac90) The South Korean government has funded the U.S. Korea Institute (USKI) with about $19 million over 12 years through the state-run KIEP. At present, we do not have information regarding the “alternative sources of funding” that 38 North claims.
Analysis / Bias
In review, 38 North frequently
[publishes](https://www.38north.org/2018/03/nada032318/) satellite [imagery](https://www.38north.org/2018/11/sohae110818/) of North Korea to show the locations and development of secret facilities and North Korean military actions. They also publish analysis of North Korea’s Kim Jong Un’s messages: [“Kim Jong Un’s 2019 New Year’s Address: Dropping a Strategic Bombshell”](https://www.38north.org/2019/01/rfrank010219/) and another article, [“Way Too Much to Do About Nothing,”](https://www.38north.org/2018/12/editor122118/) which contains the quote “I thus interpret Kim’s threat of “finding a new way” not as a hint at more nuclear tests, but rather as a message to Donald Trump: You are not our only option for security and economic development. If you refuse to cooperate, we will ignore you and turn to China. Oh, and we will take South Korea along.” They usually utilize credible sources such as the [New York Times,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) [CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), and the [Center for a New American Security](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-a-new-american-security/) when it comes to sourcing.
38 North uses minimally loaded language in their headlines and within articles such as this:
[Parade Drills Continue, No Signs of Missile Launchers Yet](https://www.38north.org/2018/02/mirim020618/). This article is sourced from current satellite images of the parade staging areas. In general, 38 North reports news and analysis with minimal bias.
