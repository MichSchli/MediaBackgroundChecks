Funded by / Ownership
True Blue Media publishes The American Independent, using content from The American Independent Foundation, a non-partisan 501(c)(3) organization, and other sources. The website also fails to disclose that Democratic political operative David Brock owns a 35% share of True Blue Media. The American Independent also lacks transparency as it does not disclose donors. Revenue is derived through advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the American Independent publishes original news stories with moderately loaded language:
[Trump silent as his allies attack Pete Buttigieg for being gay](https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-pete-buttigieg-gay-lgbtq-discrimination-2020-election-limbaugh-gorka-gop/). This story is sourced adequately from the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Daily Beast](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-beast/). The website also republishes news content from the [Associated Press.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/)
The American Independent and all of David Brock’s properties heavily supported Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. They also frequently reported negatively on Progressive candidate Bernie Sanders. However, in 2020 they do not appear to be picking a single candidate but instead are focused on discrediting Donald Trump, such as this
[Trump claims he saved the Philippines from ISIS. He didn’t.](https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-philippines-isis-islamic-state-military/)
Generally, news reporting is highly biased in favor of the left and reasonably sourced to credible media outlets.
