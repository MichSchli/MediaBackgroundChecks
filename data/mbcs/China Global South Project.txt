Analysis / Bias
The China Global South Project provides speaking engagements and consulting services and publishes podcasts on the topic of Chinese engagement in Africa.
In review, The China Global South Project publishes articles/analyses with emotionally loaded language, such as
[China-Africa 101: China’s Role in Africa’s Debt](https://chinaafricaproject.com/analysis/china-africa-101-loans-debt-lina-getachew-ayenew/) and [There are Chinese Racists, and There are Chinese Global Citizens](https://chinaafricaproject.com/analysis/there-are-chinese-racists-and-there-are-chinese-global-citizens/). Regarding sourcing, they utilize credible sources such as the [Center for Global Development,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-global-development/) [The Washington Post,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [The Economist.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-economist/)
Editorially, The China Global South Project frequently reports negatively on China. When covering USA politics as it relates to China and Africa, they say very unfavorably on the Trump administration, such as this:
[How Trumps’ Vulgar Comments About Africa Play Right Into China’s Hands](https://chinaafricaproject.com/podcasts/podcast-china-trump-africa-shithole-ismail-einashe/). The information is generally factual, with a clear bias against China.
