History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/everycrsreport.com), CRS (Congressional Research Service) is a Congress think tank, and its reports are relied upon by academics, businesses, judges, policy advocates, students, librarians, journalists, and policymakers for accurate and timely analysis of important policy issues. The reports are not classified and do not contain individualized advice to any specific member of Congress.

Analysis / Bias
In review, EveryCRSReport.com publishes every report from the Congressional Research Service, which includes the
[Congressional Budget Office (CBO)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/congressional-budget-office-cbo/) and the [Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/us-government-accountability-office-gao/). There is no spin or bias; they just publish the reports as they come in, such as this: [Authorizing New Additions to Memorials in the District of Columbia: Issues for Consideration](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/IF10448.html). This source does exactly what they claim with minimal bias.
