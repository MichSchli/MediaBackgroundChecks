Analysis / Bias
In review, The Tyee produces original journalism that utilizes moderate loaded language that favors the left, such as this:
[‘Together We Are Unstoppable.’ Thousands Join Greta Thunberg in Vancouver Climate Protest](https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/10/25/Greta-Thunberg-Vancouver-Climate-Protest-Art-Gallery-Thousands/). This story is properly sourced to credible media. In another story, [How Progressives Can Compete to Win Next Time](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/10/25/How-Progressives-Can-Compete-Next-Time/), they again support the left and properly source from credible information from [The Conversation.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-conversation/)
Editorially, most stories
[favor the left](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/) and are properly sourced to credible media outlets or information.
