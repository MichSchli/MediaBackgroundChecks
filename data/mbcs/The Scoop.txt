History
[Founded in 2016](https://whois.domaintools.com/thescoop.us), The Scoop is a conservative biased news and opinion website that publishes a combination of original and curated content. According to their [about page](https://thescoop.us/about-us/), “Instead of kissing up to the globalists and the corporate elites that control the American mainstream media, The Scoop is fighting for YOU – the American patriot.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not list an editor or ownership; however, they do indicate their conservative perspective.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Scoop provides summarized news and commentary and links to curated news stories from other sources. News is broken down into the categories “politics” and “real news.” Summarized news stories frequently use emotionally loaded language that denigrates the left, such as this
[Newsmax Reporter Rob Schmitt HUMILIATES CNN’s, Jim Acosta](https://thescoop.us/newsmax-reporter-rob-schmitt-humiliates-cnns-jim-acosta/). Original reports such as this are typically sourced to social media, videos, or hyperlinked to poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/). Curated news often is sourced from right-biased questionable sources such as [Trending Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/trending-politics/) and [Western Journal.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/)
Editorially, all stories favor the right and, particularly the former Trump administration, such as this
[Trump Releases Surprise Video On NYE: Americans Have So Much To Be Grateful For](https://thescoop.us/trump-releases-surprise-video-on-nye-americans-have-so-much-to-be-grateful-for/). During 2020-2022, The Scoop reported on the Coronavirus with [skepticism](https://thescoop.us/watch-gym-owner-starts-recall-process-for-nj-governor-over-his-failed-lockdown-policies-video/), often promoting stories that show people and businesses defying safety measures. Further, after the Presidential election, they also republished election fraud misinformation such as this [Rep. Mo Brooks: ‘Trump Won The Electoral College’ If Legal Votes Counted — Says Won’t Be Part Of The ‘Surrender Caucus](https://thescoop.us/rep-mo-brooks-trump-won-the-electoral-college-if-legal-votes-counted-says-wont-be-part-of-the-surrender-caucus/).’ They generally publish news and commentary primarily rooted in fact; however, all stories are one-sided with far-right bias.
