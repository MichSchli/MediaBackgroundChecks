Analysis / Bias
The content on the National Conservatism website, particularly its
[statement of principles](https://nationalconservatism.org/national-conservatism-a-statement-of-principles/), indicates a strong emphasis on nationalism, traditional values, and a rejection of globalism. The movement has connections with notable conservative figures like [Tucker Carlson](https://nationalconservatism.org/natcon-dc-2019/presenters/tucker-carlson/), [Charlie Kirk](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/charlie-kirk-bias-rating/), Mark Meadows, and Peter Thiel. The movement’s founder, [Yoram Hazony](https://www.yoramhazony.org/about/), has ties to the Israeli and American right and has been involved with various think tanks. His book, “The Virtue of Nationalism,” serves as a key ideological text for the movement.
National Conservatism criticizes neoconservatism and neoliberalism, advocating for independent nation-states and against supranational entities like the EU. Their principles include national independence, the rule of law, free enterprise, and the importance of the traditional family.
The website promotes its conferences and books related to National Conservatism. Further, under the “Essay” heading, they republish news, analysis, and editorial content related to the movement. These curated essays come from a wide range of sources, with most advocating conservatism.

[American Greatness](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-greatness/), [Power Line](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/power-line/), and the [Washington Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-times/).
In general, the National Conservatism website holds right-leaning biases through advocacy for national conservativism and may not always be factual due to reliance on poor sources and hosting speakers at its events like Tucker Carlson, who routinely fails fact checks and disseminates misinformation.
