Analysis / Bias
In review, the Women’s Rights News Facebook page generally publishes news articles from their owned websites such as Femalista, NoStraightNews.com, and Gucmakale.com. We have rated Femalista and Gucmakale Questionable due to a lack of transparency and poor sourcing techniques.
When reviewing Facebook pages, we look at the sources used in posts and the content of memes and commentary by the owners. When publishing news stories, they primarily use the three sources mentioned above. They also use other sources such as FemPositive.com, My Wonder Planet,
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/), and [Now This Politics](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nowthis-news/). Political content and commentary hold strongly liberal perspectives that promote feminism and denigrate conservatives. In general, the Facebook Page serves as a portal to share news articles from their websites, increasing traffic and advertising views.
