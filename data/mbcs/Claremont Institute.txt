According to their [about page](https://www.claremont.org/page/claremonts-mission/), they are a “think tank that teaches, writes, and litigates. Since our founding in 1979, our strategy has been to teach the principles of the American Founding to the future thinkers and statesmen of America. Those principles include the foundational doctrines of natural rights and natural law found in the Declaration of Independence; the ingenious political science of the Constitution; and the popular constitutionalism or reverence necessary for the maintenance of free government.” The current President is [Ryan Williams.](https://www.claremont.org/page/new-president-ryan-williams/) [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
The Claremont Institute releases a
[quarterly review of books](https://www.claremont.org/crb/what-is-inside/reviews-of-books-293/) primarily written by conservatives or has a conservative view of history. The institute also seeks to [influence politics](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/pizzagater-jack-posobiec-granted-fellowship-by-increasingly-white-nationalist-think-tank/) by educating conservative influencers, publishing the Claremont Review of Books, filing legal briefs, and engaging in litigation.
The Claremont Institute was an
[early supporter of Donald Trump](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/an-attack-on-founding-principles-at-the-claremont-institute/499094/), which created controversy, as [President Trump](https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/trumpism-nationalism-and-conservatism/) does not reflect the constitutional values that Claremont claims to uphold. Further, they have been criticized for advancing White Nationalism.
An essay written by President Ryan Williams is titled
[Defend America—Defeat Multiculturalism](https://americanmind.org/essays/defend-america-defeat-multiculturalism/). A quote from the essay reads, “If we do not reverse multiculturalism’s advance, it will continue to undermine our country and constitutionalism, destroying the possibility of the common good and a life of civic peace. Indeed, multiculturalism threatens to take down western civilization as a whole.” The essay claims that multiculturalists seek to erase and replace America. This statement alludes to [Replacement Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Replacement), a white nationalist right-wing conspiracy theory that believes Other ethnic groups will replace European Whites. This article’s title is also a tagline for an event they were advertising, which resulted in [Google banning the ad](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/googles-attack-on-the-claremont-institute-must-not-stand/) for offering “racially or ethnically oriented publications.”
The Claremont Institute has negative views on immigration, with some believing they are
[shaping President Trump’s policy](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/the-intellectual-origins-of-trumps-chilling-immigration-plan), especially regarding [ending Birthright Citizenship](https://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/birthright-citizenship-a-response-to-my-critics/). The Claremont Institute generally holds paleo-conservative views, with loose connections to the [Alt-Right](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-populist-los-angeles/).
