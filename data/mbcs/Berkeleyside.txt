Analysis / Bias
In review, Berkeleyside’s
[editorial](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2014/10/10/berkeleyside-does-not-endorse-candidates-measures) position states that Berkeleyside does not endorse political candidates. Berkeleyside utilizes neutral wording in headlines such as [“Gov. Brown pardons Berkeley Ecology Center employee at risk of deportation](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/04/03/gov-brown-pardons-berkeley-ecology-center-employee-at-risk-of-deportation),” however, in the body of the article, they typically present left-leaning perspectives. [Editorial and opinion pieces](http://www.berkeleyside.com/opinion) often favor the left. Berkeleyside usually sources via quotations and utilizes credible sources such as [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/) (kqed.org ). They also use sources not known to us, such as advancingjustice-alc.org.
Failed Fact Checks
