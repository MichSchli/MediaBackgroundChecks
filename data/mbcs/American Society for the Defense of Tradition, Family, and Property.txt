Analysis / Bias
In review, TFP is a
[Radical Traditionalist Catholic](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/radical-traditional-catholicism) organization that is fiercely anti-abortion and anti-LGBT. They also view liberalism and socialism as evils that degrade society. The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property has been cited in [several ](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/10/07/extremists-many-stripes-gather-values-voter-summit-2011) [Southern Poverty Law Center articles.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/) According to the [SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2013/03/26/national-organization-marriage-has-rough-start-2013), the TFP is a “virulently anti-LGBT group.”
Editorially, they support the far Christian Right, with very questionable stories and support for former President Trump. For example, in the following article, they claim that witches are casting a spell on former President Trump:
[Pray to Our Lord Jesus to break the witches “binding spell” against Trump](https://www.tfp.org/act/petition/pray-lord-jesus-break-witches-binding-spell-trump/). In general, TFP is a far-right hate group that publishes false and misleading information.
