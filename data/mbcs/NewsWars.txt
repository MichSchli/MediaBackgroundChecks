History
Founded in 2017, NewsWars is a news and opinion website by
[Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) publisher and far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, where he claims to be bringing “truth back to the media.” He’s infamously made [false claims](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/12/alex-jones-infowars-founder-launches-new-website-n/) concerning the [2012 Sandy Hook massacre](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/sep/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-austins-alex-jones-said-no/), and federal investigators said he inspired a gunman to open fire inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria by touting unfounded allegations on his shows and websites about its supposed ties to former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and [human trafficking](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/26/521545788/conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-apologizes-for-promoting-pizzagate). This is a conspiracy website, period. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the website is laid out to look similar to the
[New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), which both Alex Jones and Donald Trump claim is a fake news source. All news articles are curated from other sources, including Jones’ own Infowars. Common sources used are Russian propaganda news site [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), Alt-right [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), and other conspiracy websites such as [Zero Hedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/). This site is not placed in our Conspiracy-Pseudoscience category is due to having more political news than conspiracy information. Though there is plenty of conspiracy, Jones shares numerous stories from Infowars and provides a link to listen to his radio show live on the website. This website is also different in that the majority of news is real. The reason for the Questionable classification is that all stories favor the right, indicating extreme bias, there are [unproven conspiracies](https://newswars.com/soros-army-launches-race-war-on-his-birthday) published, and Jones’ longtime reputation as a purveyor of [fake news stories](http://www.snopes.com/tag/infowars/). In general, this is a far-right media source that publishes conspiracy theories.
