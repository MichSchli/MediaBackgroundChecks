Analysis / Bias
In review, PETA “opposes
[speciesism](https://headlines.peta.org/end-speciesism/), a human-supremacist worldview, and focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: in laboratories, in the food industry, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry.” PETA has been [called](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/people-for-the-ethical-treatment-of-animals-peta/) “one of the world’s largest, most aggressive, and most controversial animal liberation groups.” Articles and headlines on the website are often highly emotional such as this [WATCH: Mice Struggle to Crawl After Experimenters Crush Spinal Cords](https://www.peta.org/blog/german-experimenters-paralyze-mice-archaic-tests/). Regarding sourcing, most videos and photos displayed on the website come from anonymous sources, indicating poor sourcing and a lack of transparency.
When it comes to science PETA has
[promoted](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/) that [Milk is a cause for Autism](http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/peta-embraces-autism-pseudoscience/). They have also claimed that [beer is more healthy](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-mar-14-cl-8515-story.html) than milk as a way to protect cows. Finally, PETA is known for [extreme measures](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PETA) such as throwing red paint on people wearing fur and for comparing “Livestock treatment to both the Holocaust and to the mass lynching of African-Americans.” In general, news reporting is not always factual and aligns with the far left when it comes to animal activism.
