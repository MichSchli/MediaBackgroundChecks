Analysis / Bias
Identity Evropa is a white supremacist and white separatist group. The group is opposed to all people in the USA who are not of white European decent. The mission of the group is to end immigration and achieve a 90% white America. The website does not publish news, but serves as portal for information about the group and how to join.
Several prominent groups have labeled Identity Evropa a hate group. These include the
[Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/identity-evropa) and the [Anti-Defamation League](https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/identity-evropa). Politically, the group is economically far left as they oppose capitalism. Based on this group holding both extreme left economic views and extreme right social views (Fascist Nazism) we will not rate them left or right on the bias scale.
