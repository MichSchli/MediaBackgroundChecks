History
Experience Awareness is an imposter website, meaning it uses a deceptive domain or looks like a credible news website, but it is not. The use of the domain AbcBusinessNews.com that leads to a Questionable website called Experience Awareness is a classic example of an Imposter website.
Experience Awareness curates news from a variety of mostly extreme right Questionable and/or conspiracy websites. Further, this source completely lacks transparency as there is not a means to contact them, there isn’t any original content, and ownership is not disclosed. The only name associated with the website is fake:
[Cornelius Rupert T.](http://www.abcbusinessnews.com/author/admin/) [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The website does not disclose ownership and there does not appear to be a revenue source.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Experience Awareness curates news from six different sources as follows:
[CNN](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/) (Left), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) (Right-Conspiracy), [Drudge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/) (Right-Questionable), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) (Right-Questionable), [NewsWars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newswars/) (Right-Questionable) and [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) (Right-Conspiracy). CNN does seem out of place, perhaps it is an attempt to create balance?
Curated news stories are literally copied directly from the above sources in what can only be described as gross copyright infringement and plagiarism. Based on the sources used, story selection favors the right 80% of the time. Further, most of the sources have horrible track records with fact checkers, such as Alex Jones’ NewsWars and Infowars. In general, Experience Awareness is not a credible media source.
