Analysis / Bias
In review, Clickhole publishes humorous satire news that is disclaimed on their about page and at the bottom of pages with this statement “ClickHole uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.” In very clear words, they are satire.
A sample story from Clickhole reads like this
[Heartbreaking: This Man Has Been Working For Weeks Under The Impression That He’s An Essential Worker](https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-man-has-been-working-for-weeks-under-the-impression-that-hes-an-essential-worker/). While there are political stories, most simply are capturing the moment and satirizing it. Another example is this [Fighting Impeachment: Trump Has Had Barron Bury Him Up To The Neck In The White House Lawn So That He Cannot Be Removed From Office](https://clickhole.com/fighting-impeachment-trump-has-had-barron-bury-him-up-1838449581/). This is a clearly disclaimed satire website.
