Funded by / Ownership
C-SPAN publishes and broadcasts the Washington Journal, owned by National Satellite Cable Corporation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. “C-SPAN began airing internet commercials early in 2021 and offering C-SPAN-themed clothing though not soliciting donations on-air; nonetheless, as a non-commercial public service, it receives most of its funding from subscriber fees charged to cable and direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) operators.”

In addition, the website features videos from the TV show that are low biased and provide a verbatim text transcript, such as this

The guests on Wahington Journal usually consist of elected officials, those involved in government, or experts in the field. Many guests are highly biased, representing both the right and left; however, the hosts ask direct questions and typically do not lead guests. While the hosts certainly have biases, there is a reasonable balance presented. Therefore, Washington Journal is factual in reporting and low biased.
Failed Fact Checks
- Guests on the show often make false claims, but there is no record of the hosts making false claims.
