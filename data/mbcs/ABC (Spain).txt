Analysis / Bias

[conservative](https://www.eurotopics.net/en/148402/abc) newspaper of record.
In review, Spanish national news is reported with relatively low bias with articles and headlines such as this
[Madrid prepares a “return operation” for the return to normality in September](https://www.abc.es/espana/madrid/abci-madrid-prepara-operacion-retorno-para-vuelta-normalidad-septiembre-202008291037_noticia.html). International news is provided through correspondents in other countries as well as newswire services such as [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/).
Editorially, the paper holds a conservative perspective with favorable reports on the Catholic Church
[“Self confessionals” in the US: a priest hears confessions from the car for the coronavirus](https://www.abc.es/sociedad/abci-autoconfesionarios-eeuu-sacerdote-escucha-confesiones-desde-coche-coronavirus-202003251109_noticia.html) and frequent criticism of socialism [The Valencian Socialists, against the Monarchy: “There is no room for Kings that nobody has voted](https://www.abc.es/espana/comunidad-valenciana/abci-socialistas-valencianos-contra-monarquia-no-caben-reyes-nadie-votado-201804141831_noticia.html). When reporting on USA politics, there is a reasonable balance with slightly more negative toward Trump [The great march against racism turns into a repudiation of Trump](https://www.abc.es/internacional/abci-gran-marcha-contra-racismo-convierte-repudio-trump-202008282115_noticia.html).
