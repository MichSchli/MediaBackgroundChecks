Analysis / Bias
In review, the Intellectual Takeout covers topics such as “culture, economics, education, history, philosophy, politics, and religion.” They sometimes utilize
[sources](http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/us-economy-hits-all-time-low-freedom-index) that are factually mixed, such as [Heritage Foundation](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/heritage-foundation/), [CNS News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cns-news/), and The [Daily Signal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-signal/). However, most articles are appropriately sourced to credible media outlets such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/). When it comes to science, the Intellectual Takeout does not deny that the planet is warming, but they do cast doubt on whether [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is influenced by human activities such as this: [Can You Be Certain That Man causes climate Change?](https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/can-you-be-certain-climate-change-caused-man)
Finally, Intellectual Takeout published misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccines, falsely suggesting that they were fraudulently promoted and ineffective in preventing infection and transmission, while credible studies and health organizations affirm their efficacy in reducing severe disease, hospitalization, and death. The outlet also spread unfounded claims that COVID-19 vaccines cause miscarriages in pregnant women despite multiple peer-reviewed studies and health expert statements indicating no evidence of such risks. Additionally, it incorrectly labeled COVID-19 vaccines as gene therapy, a claim refuted by scientific explanations and regulatory definitions distinguishing mRNA vaccines from gene therapy products.
Editorially, most stories favor conservative-libertarian policies and endorse a
[free-market capitalism](https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/three-reasons-flawed-capitalism-still-better-perfect-socialism) approach to economics.
