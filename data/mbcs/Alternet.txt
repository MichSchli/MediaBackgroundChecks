History
AlterNet is a liberal activist news service and is a non-profit Independent Media Institute project that was Launched in 1998. According to their
[about page](https://www.alternet.org/about-alternet/), “AlterNet has developed a unique model of journalism to confront the failures of corporate media, as well as the vitriol and disinformation of right-wing media, especially “hate talk” media.” The current editor is Roxanne Cooper.
In 2018, AlterNet was bought by the owners of the left-leaning
[Raw Story](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/raw-story/) under the newly created company AlterNet Media. According to John Byrne, one of the owners of Raw Story, “AlterNet will continue to carry content from the Independent Media Institute, its prior owner.” According to Fairness.com, the “Independent Media Institute has served the public by creating and distributing content about political and social issues.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

The owners of Raw Story own AlterNet under the name AlterNet Media. The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, AlterNet publishes news with a far-left bias through story selection and the use of emotionally loaded words such as these:
[Trump goes off in an all-caps New Year’s Eve Twitter meltdown: ‘MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL’](https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/trump-goes-off-in-an-all-caps-new-years-eve-twitter-meltdown-mexico-is-paying-for-the-wall/) and [The F Word: The Craven Right-Wing Is Now Smearing Teenage School Shooting Survivors](https://www.alternet.org/activism/f-word-craven-right-wing-now-smearing-teenage-school-shooting-survivors). The website also features a [separate news category](https://www.alternet.org/category/trump/) that focuses on negative reports about Donald Trump. AlterNet typically uses known mainstream sources such as the [New York Daily News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-daily-news/) and [NBC News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/) when it comes to sourcing.
AlterNet also frequently delves into pseudoscience to promote
[anti-GMO propaganda](https://www.alternet.org/?s=gmo), which is not consistent with the [consensus of science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/). AlterNet has consistently reported on the connection between [cell phones and cancer](https://www.alternet.org/?s=cell+phone+radiation), which is misleading as [there is not a scientific consensus](http://www.yalescientific.org/2014/07/mythbusters-do-cell-phones-really-cause-cancer/) on whether radiation from cell phones causes cancer or not.
AlterNet consistently publishes pro-Left news stories and those that denigrate the right.
