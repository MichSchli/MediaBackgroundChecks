Analysis / Bias
In 2021
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Ecuador [96/180](https://rsf.org/en/ecuador) in their Press Freedom Index, citing a “Worrying increase in violence.” In Ecuador, [defamation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19401181) law is a criminal offense. In June 2013, a Communications Law was passed that “provides for the regulation of editorial content and gives officials the power to sanction media outlets” used by politicians to [censor](https://ironline.american.edu/communications-law-ecuador-censoring-cartoon-becomes-presidential-priority/) critical journalists. The new president Lenin Moreno who took office in 2017, pledged a new era of press freedom.
In review, Ecuavisa typically publishes articles with minimal emotionally loaded language, such as
[“Teachers refuse to return to face-to-face work in 2021”](https://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/noticias/nacional/672871-maestros-rechazan-regresar-al-trabajo-presencial-2021) and [“Moreno changes Napo governor for action against journalist.”](https://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/noticias/politica/665901-moreno-cambia-gobernador-napo-accion-contra-periodista) In this article, Ecuavisa reports the news with a neutral tone as the article is about a case where The governor of Napo sued the journalist Juan Sarmiento. The Napo court of justice sentenced the journalist on the grounds of moral, emotional, and dignity damage. This was because he questioned the governor’s response to the health crisis. In response, President Lenin Moreno asked for the resignation of the governor of Napo.
Editorially, Ecuavisa leans right. For example, during the 2017 presidential elections, left-wing Alianza País candidate Lenin Moreno won; however, Ecuavisa, which is known to be close with
[Guillermo Lasso](https://theconversation.com/the-left-won-ecuadors-presidential-election-cue-right-wing-revolt-76262), who is the founder and leader of the center-right party CREO, was shown to have a large lead through exit polling: [“Guillermo Lasso obtains 53.02% compared to 46.98% of Lenín Moreno, according to Cedatos exit poll”.](https://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/noticias/politica/258016-guillermo-lasso-obtiene-5302-frente-al-4698-lenin-moreno-segun) The exit poll was misleading as they were incorrect because Lasso lost the election. When it comes to sourcing, Ecuavisa doesn’t hyperlink; however, they typically source Spanish international news agency [EFE.](https://www.efe.com/efe/espana/1)
