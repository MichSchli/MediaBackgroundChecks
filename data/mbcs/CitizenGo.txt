Analysis / Bias
CitizenGo is a website that publishes emotionally loaded articles and petitions with false claims, such as
[“State Farm pushing Gender Ideology on 5-year-olds!”](https://citizengo.org/en-us/fm/207979-state-farm-pushing-gender-ideology-5-year-olds) For example, a quote from the petition reads, “The LGBTQ mob and State farm have decided to try and recruit new transgender activists by trying to turn innocent and trusting five-year-olds into confused, LGBTQ drones.” However, there is no evidence or hyperlink provided to support their claims. Further, the claim is false as the program [GenderCool](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/05/26/state-farm-cuts-ties-with-lgbtq-group/) they are alluding to does not recruit or attempt to convert children. GenderCool distributes books written from first-person Transgender and LGBTQ perspectives and is not part of any curriculum.
CitizenGo also urges readers to sign petitions in support of conservative Supreme Court justices, such as
[“President Trump: Appoint a Pro-Life and Pro-Family Conservative to the SCOTUS”](https://citizengo.org/en-us/182344-president-trump-appoint-pro-life-and-pro-family-conservative-scotus) and to defund the [WHO organization.”](https://citizengo.org/en-us/ot/179003-president-trump-continue-defund-who) Other causes they support are [anti-abortion](https://citizengo.org/en-us/lf/210079-stop-satanic-temples-abortion-facility) legislation, stopping the teaching of [Critical Race Theory (CRT)](https://citizengo.org/en/signit/202501/view), and they have been accused of spreading [reproductive health disinformation](https://qz.com/africa/2131931/spains-citizengo-accused-of-paying-kenyans-to-spread-health-disinformation). [According](https://www.windycitytimes.com/lgbt/WORLD-Conversion-therapy-Lebanese-group-Japanese-marriage-suit/65104.html) to the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/southern-poverty-law-center/), “Powerful U.S.-based anti-LGBT hate groups, including the World Congress of Families ( WCF ), are working alongside global online petition platform CitizenGO to train, meet with and support three influential anti-LGBT groups in Italy. Finally, [The Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-bureau-of-investigative-journalism/) indicates CitizenGo is a hate group with this article [Unholy alliance: the far-right religious network attacking reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-09-25/unholy-alliance-the-far-right-religious-network-attacking-reproductive-and-lgbtq-rights).
In general, CitizenGO is a far-right Christian political advocacy group that promotes propaganda, pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and anti-LGBTQ hate to advance its agenda.
