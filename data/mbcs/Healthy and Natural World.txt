Analysis / Bias
In review, Healthy and Natural World publish news and information about alternative health and nutrition. Many stories focus on herbs, home remedies, and beauty. An example of a typical home remedy story is
[The Best Home Remedies For Sinus Infection](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/best-home-remedies-for-sinus-infection/). While the effectiveness of these remedies is questionable, there is little harm in trying these at home. In fact, most information on this website is benign. However, Healthy and Natural World publish pseudoscience that could be considered dangerous, such as [natural cures for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/): [How To Make Alkaline Water To Fight Fatigue, Boost Immune System, Protect Kidneys, and More](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/best-home-remedies-for-sinus-infection/). This article claims that “there is even some evidence that alkaline water may halt cancer development.” At this time, there is [zero evidence](https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/03/24/dont-believe-the-hype-10-persistent-cancer-myths-debunked/) to support this claim.
Regarding supporting the scientific consensus on
[GMOs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/), they don’t: [8 Hidden Ingredients You Didn’t Know Were In Your Bread](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/scary-ingredients-you-didnt-know-were-in-your-bread/). In general, Healthy and Natural World publish a mix of credible scientifically backed information and debunked pseudoscience.
