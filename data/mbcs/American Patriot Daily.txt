History
[Founded in 2015](http://whois.domaintools.com/americanpatriotdaily.com), American Patriot Daily is a news and opinion blog with an extreme right-wing bias in reporting. The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose authors or editors. [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
In review, American Patriot Daily does not produce original news reporting but rather takes existing stories from other sources and adds conservative opinions. There is frequent use of highly emotional language such as this:
[Nancy Pelosi Committed Political Suicide With One Impeachment Announcement](https://www.americanpatriotdaily.com/pollresults/nancy-pelosi-political-suicide/). This story does not contain a single hyperlink to support its claims. Another story titled [One Top Trump Whistleblower Was Just Caught Red-Handed Doing the Unthinkable](https://www.americanpatriotdaily.com/featured/trump-whistleblower-caught-red-handed/)…Also uses loaded language that does not match the content of the story. Further, the story contains highly biased commentary such as this: “The coup attempt against President Trump is well underway. But while Democrats are working overtime to destroy the President, the mainstream media just made one mistake that will come back to bite them.”
Do we really need to explain the difference between a coup attempt and using legal channels…I hope not! If you have questions on this, let us know through our contact forms, and we will give you the facts.
American Patriot Daily also promotes conspiracy theories such as Clinton’s murdering rivals and opponents, which never seems to come true:
[This Murder Investigation Could Ruin Hillary Clinton](https://www.americanpatriotdaily.com/featured/murder-investigation-hillary-clinton/). Finally, this source also promoted former President Obama as a Muslim conspiracy theory, as seen here: [Obama’s Muslim background and coke habit came back to haunt him](https://www.americanpatriotdaily.com/latest/obamas-muslim-background-and-coke-habit-came-back-to-haunt-him/). In general, this is a fake news source that routinely publishes misleading and unsourced information to dupe gullible people into believing falsehoods.
