History
Founded in 2007 by two former
[Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) Journalists, [John F. ](https://www.politico.eu/staff/john-f-harris/)Harris and Jim VandeHei, Politico is a news and opinion website based in Virginia, USA. Currently, [Matthew Kaminski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Kaminski) is the editor-in-chief. In 2016, [Jim VandeHei](https://www.wsj.com/articles/politico-ceo-reins-in-predecessors-projects-1490002200) left Politico and is now the co-founder and CEO of [Axios](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/axios/). They describe their [vision](https://www.politico.com/about-us) as “Politico strives to be the dominant source for politics and policy in power centers across every continent where access to reliable information, non-partisan journalism, and real-time tools creates, informs, and engages a global citizenry.”
It distributes content via the internet, the Politico newspaper, radio, and podcasts. In Washington, D.C., its coverage includes the U.S. Congress, lobbying, media, and the presidency. They also have their own bi-monthly magazine that covers politics, news, and opinions.
On 5/2/2022,

Analysis / Bias
Both sides of the political spectrum have accused Politico of having a left or right bias. For example,
[Media Matters for America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/media-matters/), a progressive media watchdog group in Washington, has accused them of having a “ [Republican tilt.](https://www.politico.com/story/2007/03/is-politico-a-gop-shill-003011)” Politico also published an article criticizing Obama for not being a strong supporter of Israel: [“Obama’s Jewish Problem.”](https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2007/03/obamas-jewish-problem-000635) In another article, they state that Liberals are not as tolerant as they say they are: “ [Why Liberals Aren’t as Tolerant as They Think.”](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/09/why-liberals-arent-as-tolerant-as-they-think-215114) Further, an article criticizing Democratic Socialism: [“Down Goes Socialism,”](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/08/democratic-socialism-sanders-ocasio-cortez-2018-primary-results-219161) and another criticizing Bernie Sanders, “ [Bernie’s army in disarray.”](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/21/bernie-sanders-democrats-2018-599331) Lastly, according to the [Poynter Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/poynter-institute/), Politico is [balanced](https://www.poynter.org/news/many-politics-sites-draw-partisan-audiences-politico-strikes-perfect-balance).
The right-leaning
[Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/) had also [criticized Politico](https://dailycaller.com/2017/07/15/politico-watch-the-most-biased-items-of-the-week/) for having a liberal bias when they compared a New York Times headline to Politico’s Playbook headline by claiming that it “Extended further to the left than the NYT on this headline.”
A 2014
[Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/) Survey found that [59% of Politico’s audience](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/politico/) is consistently or primarily liberal, 16% Mixed, and 26% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience prefers politico.
In review, Politico occasionally publishes listicles such as
[“All of Trump’s Russia Ties, in 7 Charts.”](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/connections-trump-putin-russia-ties-chart-flynn-page-manafort-sessions-214868) They also publish articles with minimally loaded words such as [“Ocasio-Cortez warns Trump Jr. about subpoena power in response to the meme”](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/07/ocasio-cortez-trump-jr-subpoena-meme-1050519) and the source to credible media outlets such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and the [NY Times.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) However, they sometimes use emotional headlines: [Establishment looks to crush liberals on Medicare for All.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/10/establishment-democrats-progressive-medicare-1052215) They also have a [content partnership](https://www.politico.com/tag/south-china-morning-post) with the [South China Morning Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-china-morning-post/), which we rate Mixed for factual reporting.
Editorially, they provide a balance of opinions in the past, as evidenced by the criticism they have received from both sides. However, since our last review, many more op-eds and news stories favor the left through story selection and wording, such as this
[Republicans gripped by dread as multiple crises swirl](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/republicans-dread-coronavirus-infections-426351), and this [Trump official pressured CDC to change report on Covid and kids](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/trump-cdc-coronavirus-report-change-425538). They generally report news factually and recently with a more left-leaning bias in both story selection and editorial positions.
