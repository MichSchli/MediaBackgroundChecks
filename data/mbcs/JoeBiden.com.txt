Joe Biden’s website states, “Paid for by Biden For President, a campaign made up of millions of grassroots donors — and absolutely zero malarkey.” Revenue is derived through fundraising, donations, and a
[store](https://store.joebiden.com/) that sells merchandise and campaign materials.
Analysis / Bias
In review, JoeBiden.com features the
[sections](https://joebiden.com/) “Joe’s Story, Kamala’s Story, Joe’s Vision, Action Center, Coalitions, The Latest, Store and How to Vote.” When you click “Action Center,” the site demands your email, money (how to become a grassroots fundraiser) and provides campaign updates.
Under the “Coalition” section, you will find specific groups supporting Joe Biden, such as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Climate Voters, Latinos, Jewish Americans, Educators, and more. The list starts with
[Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders](https://joebiden.com/highlights-from-joe-bidens-agenda-for-the-asian-american-pacific-islander-community/), and when you click “Learn more,” you can view Joe Biden’s policy in a detailed fashion. For example, under the subtitle “Counter Rise in Hate Crimes,” they note the problem as “Trump’s dangerous rhetoric and fanning the flames of hate.” They also highlight the accomplishments of Joe Biden when he was Vice President “The Obama-Biden Administration added “Anti-Sikh” and “Anti-Hindu” to the Department of Justice’s hate crime reporting categories.” Further, they include Joe Biden’s promises if he becomes President “Joe will clarify that hate has no safe harbor in this country. And, his Justice Department will prioritize prosecuting hate crimes.”
Another group from the “Coalition” list is titled
[“women.”](https://joebiden.com/womens-agenda/) When you click to read more, he explains his agenda regarding the issues related to women, emphasizing inclusion and equality for women, and explains “particularly women of color,” stating “He will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce.” This article links to sources such as the [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [NPR](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/), and the [Center for American Progress](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center-for-american-progress/).
Under the title
[Education,”](https://joebiden.com/education/) there are bullet points such as “Support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.” A quote from this section reads, “Biden will triple funding for Title I, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families, and require districts to use these funds to offer educators competitive salaries and make other critical investments before directing the funds to other purposes.” In this case, they use credible sources such as nasponline.org (National Association of School Psychologists), [cdc.gov](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/), and [Epi.org](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/economic-policy-institute/).
JoeBiden.com also frequently publishes news from a liberal perspective that uses moderately loaded emotional language such as this
[“Fact Sheet: Support for Schools So They Can Reopen Safely and Effectively.”](https://joebiden.com/2020/09/02/fact-sheet-support-for-schools-so-they-can-reopen-safely-and-effectively/) This article is sourced to the Washington Post with a quote that reads, “Millions of students are now beginning the school year at home instead of in the classroom because President Trump didn’t do his job.” The website also publishes [statements](https://joebiden.com/covid19-leadership/) made by Joe Biden, such as “04/27/20 – Statement by Vice President Joe Biden and the Biden for President Public Health Advisory Committee on Testing” sourced to an article written by Joe Biden published through [Medium](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/medium/).
