Analysis / Bias
In review, GreenMedInfo primarily publishes alternative health and nutrition information. For example, they publish journal abstracts from
[Pubmed](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pubmed/), which are generally pro-science. However, GreenMedInfo also publishes original articles such as this: [Coronavirus Death Rate Lower Than Thought](https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/coronavirus-death-rate-lower-thought). This story is reasonably sourced from the [World Health Organization](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/) and [Stat News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/stat-news/). At the same time, some articles are accurate and align with the consensus of science. Many do not.
GreenMedInfo frequently publishes false information about a link between
[Autism and ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/)vaccinations: [Mercury exposure from thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines raised the subsequent risk of atypical autism diagnosis.](https://www.greenmedinfo.com/article/mercury-exposure-thimerosal-containing-childhood-vaccines-raised-subsequent--0) According to the CDC, there is no link between [vaccines and autism](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-autism-vaccine-link/). Further, they promote [miracle cures for cancer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/), such as this [Research: Plants Cure Cancer, Not Chemicals](https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/research-plants-cure-cancer-not-chemicals). Finally, they also promote conspiracy theories such as this [Why Doctors”Do Not Want to Find a Cure for Cancer](https://tv.greenmedinfo.com/doctors-want-find-cure-cancer/).” When it comes to sourcing, GreenMedInfo routinely relies on very poor sources such as [Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/) and [Mercola](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mercola/).
