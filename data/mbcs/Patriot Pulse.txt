Analysis / Bias
The Patriot Pulse does not publish original news stories but rather interjects right-wing biased opinions around news stories. All stories favor the right and often harshly denigrate the left, such as this:
[Donald Trump made Joe Biden an offer that no one saw coming](https://patriotpulse.net/donald-trump-made-joe-biden-an-offer-that-no-one-saw-coming/). This story does not use hyperlinked sourcing on the information they are referencing.
Editorially, all stories strongly favor the right such as this
[Nancy Pelosi is panicking after a leading Republican revealed this major problem](https://patriotpulse.net/nancy-pelosi-is-panicking-after-a-leading-republican-revealed-this-major-problem/), and [Joe Biden made one insane demand that Ron DeSantis immediately shut down](https://patriotpulse.net/joe-biden-made-one-insane-demand-that-ron-desantis-immediately-shut-down/). In general, many stories on this website advance right-wing conspiracy theories and propaganda while sometimes using poor sources such as [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/).
