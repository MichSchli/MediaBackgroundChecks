Analysis / Bias
In review, Medical News Today generally publishes very well-sourced credible medical news that is Pro-Science. However, they also cover
[alternative medicine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/search?q=alternative+medicine&p=1), which would be fine if they were discrediting it. While they don’t endorse alternative medicine, they also don’t refute it and give it equal standing with traditional well-researched medicine. For this reason, we feel there should be caution when using this source, but for the most part, this is pro-science.
