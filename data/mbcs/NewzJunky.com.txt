Analysis / Bias
In review, NewzJunky is a news aggregation website that covers Northern New York State as well as national news. NewzJunky produces some original content such as this: Northern Credit Union announces new locations in Dexter and Croghan, however, there isn’t sourcing or any names associated with the article. For local news they aggregate credible local TV and newspapers. For national news, they use a wide variety of sources such as the questionable Daily Mail, BBC, NBC News, and the New York Post.
In general, there is minimal bias as they do not provide editorials and they use a wide variety of right and left-leaning sources. However, some sources are questionable or mixed for factual reporting.
