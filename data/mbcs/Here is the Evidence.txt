A description of the website reads, “Due to the irregularity of this current 2020 Presidential Election, this is a crowdsourcing tool for organizing anomalies and legal issues. Our desire is that more of the election process would be made transparent so there would be unquestionable confidence in our voting systems.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Here is the Evidence allows people to upload/post evidence of voter fraud during the 2020 election. Although they request that people only post evidence that would be admissible in court, most of the information comes from social media posts and poor sources such as
[Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), and [Judicial Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/judicial-watch/), all of which we rate as far-right biased and Questionable. They also have supposed witness accounts from unreliable sources such as [Some Bitch Told Me](https://www.somebitchtoldme.com/post/maidengate-i-wasn-t-thinking-big-enough). While some of the information is factual many of the posts rely on poor sources who frequently fail fact checks and publish misinformation regarding election fraud during the 2020 election.
Failed Fact Checks
- None. Here is the Evidence does not publish original content. However, the sources posted have failed numerous fact checks.
