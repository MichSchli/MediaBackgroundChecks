History
[Founded in 2011](http://whois.domaintools.com/unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com) by [Rick (Tank) Ferran](https://rocketreach.co/rick-ferran-email_2254990), Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children is a conservative news website as well as an online store that sells conservative related merchandise. According to their about page “Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children is a community founded by United States Marine Veterans to bring awareness of the lamestream media.” They state their [mission](https://news.unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/9091-2/) as to “raise awareness of threats foreign and domestic against our Constitutional Rights by providing accurate news, commentary, and facilitating the organization of Patriot groups in the defense of Freedom.” [Read our profile on United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

The website does not openly state ownership. Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children is funded through advertising and an
[online store](https://shop.unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/) that sells branded merchandise as well as conservative and pro-Trump items.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children publishes news and opinions with a strong right-leaning bias. Story selection always favors the right and utilizes strong emotional wording such as this,
[AL ABORTION BAN – LEFTISTS IN MELTDOWN OVER “PATRIARCHY”](https://news.unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/al-abortion-ban-leftists-in-meltdown-over-patriarchy/). This particular story is poorly sourced to tweets rather than credible media sources. Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children frequently publishes propaganda pieces highlighting the dangers of illegal immigration such as this: [TEXAS ILLEGAL ALIEN CHARGED WITH 12 MURDERS OF ELDERLY WOMEN, MAYBE HUNDREDS MORE](https://news.unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/texas-illegal-alien-charged-with-12-murders-of-elderly-women-maybe-hundreds-more/). This story is sourced to the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and the factually Mixed [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/). The headline of the story is very misleading as it claims there may be 100’s more murdered by this man, however, the article states that police are investigating 750 other deaths. It does not mean this man was responsible for 100’s of them. This is classic propaganda to seize on a factual statement and make an unknown claim that cannot be substantiated.
In another
[article](https://news.unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/birthers-dems-dirty-tricks-conspiracy-theory-truth/) they promote the conspiracy that former President Obama is a Muslim as well as the age-old debunked birth certificate conspiracy. In general, story selection always favors the right, and sometimes poor sources are utilized. They also do not distinguish between straight news and opinion, which is misleading. It is safe to say most content on this website is opinion. Further, they frequently publish outright false or misleading claims and memes on their social media pages. See below.
