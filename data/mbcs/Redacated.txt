According to their
[YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/@RedactedNews/about), “Clayton and his wife Natali take an in-depth look at the legal, social, financial, and personal issues that matter to you. They want to set the record straight and bring you the stories nobody else is telling. Along with the facts and the full picture, Redacted offers real-world analysis without an agency driven by corporate overloads.” [In 2019, Clayton Morris moved to Portugal](https://www.thewrap.com/former-fox-friends-host-clayton-morris-moves-to-portugal-amid-legal-battle-over-fraud-accusations/) from the USA. Some sources claim it is due to numerous lawsuits against him for defrauding people with his real estate investment company. They report that he is trying to escape the financial judgments against him. Regardless, he and Redacted are based in Portugal.

Analysis / Bias
The Redacted YouTube Channel and Podcast publish conspiratorially motivated news stories appealing to a conservative/anti-establishment audience. Many stories promote unproven claims such as this
[She’s exposing the TRUTH in Ukraine and they don’t like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzMLPSXb7RU), and [Holy SH*T, they just admitted US has ‘boots on the ground’ in Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTNbxxUA9fA). Many stories reviewed relate to unproven claims related to [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/). This last story is [false/misleading](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-pentagon-military-ukraine-idUSL1N31Z26L) as we do not have boots on the ground, but rather weapons inspectors.
Redacted also promotes misleading information regarding Covid-19 vaccines like this from their website,
[The Covid Vaccine’s Adverse Effects on Women](https://redacted.inc/the-covid-vaccines-adverse-effects-on-women/). While the article itself is factual, the headline leads one to believe that the vaccine is harmful to women. [It is not](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/01/06/covid-periods-longer/). Finally, Redacted frequently promotes conspiracy theories related to economics, especially as it relates to the [World Economic Forum,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-economic-forum/) [Forget the Great Reset. now it’s The Great Segmentation for Schwab](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/forget-the-great-reset-now-its-the-great-segmentation/id1535249499?i=1000586506196). In general, Redacted publishes a mix of factual and misleading conspiracy-type stories that would appeal to a conservative or anti-establishment audience.
