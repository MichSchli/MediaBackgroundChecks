History
Launched in 1821,
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2014/dec/18/histories-of-the-newspapers) is a British daily newspaper published in London, UK. Its original name is The Manchester Guardian, and cotton merchant John Edward Taylor founded it. Taylor’s nephew Charles Prestwich Scott (CP Scott) was the first editor and later became the paper owner (1846 –1932). He was also a Liberal Member of Parliament. After CP Scott, his son John Russell Scott became the Manchester Guardian’s manager and founder of the Scott Trust. The Manchester Guardian was renamed the Guardian in 1959. In 1993 the Guardian Media Group acquired the Observer.
The Guardian U.S. was launched in 2011 in New York. They also have an Australia Edition (Launched in 2013, digital edition) and an International edition. The paper focuses on politics, policy, business, and international relations. Their coverage includes News and Opinion, Sports, Culture, Lifestyle, Podcasts, and more.

Funded by / Ownership
The Guardian and its sister publication, the Sunday newspaper
[The Observer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-observer/), are owned by [Guardian Media Group plc (GMG).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Media_Group) [Scott Trust Limited](https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust) was created in 1936 to ensure the editorial independence of the publications and owns Guardian Media Group plc (GMG). The Guardian states that “The Scott Trust is the sole shareholder in Guardian Media Group, and its profits are reinvested in journalism and do not benefit a proprietor or shareholders.” Donations and advertising fund the Guardian.
The Guardian switched to a
[tabloid](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/business/media/guardian-tabloid-uk.html) print format in 2018 to cut costs. According to The New York Times, The Guardian “refused to set up a paywall — the preferred strategy of many of its rivals, from The Times of London to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times — opting instead to ask its readers for donations, even setting up a nonprofit arm to help fund its journalism.”
Analysis / Bias
The Guardian has always been a left-wing publication throughout its history, as they have stated in various
[articles.
](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/16/uselections2004.usa2)
In review, story selection favors the left but is generally factual. They utilize emotionally loaded headlines such as
[“The cashless society is a con – and big finance is behind it”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/cashless-society-con-big-finance-banks-closing-atms) and [“Trump back-pedals on Russian meddling remarks after an outcry](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/17/donald-trump-putin-summit-republicans).” The Guardian typically utilizes credible sources such as [ thoughtco.com,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/thoughtco/) gov.uk., and factually mixed sources such as [HuffPost](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/huffington-post/) and [ independent.co.uk.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/)
A
[2014 Pew Research Survey](https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/guardian/) found that 72% of The Guardian’s audience is consistently or primarily liberal, 20% Mixed, and 9% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that a more liberal audience strongly prefers the Guardian. Further, a [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) institute survey found that 52% of respondents [trust their news coverage](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/united-kingdom) and 19% do not, ranking them #7 in trust of the major UK news providers.
The Guardian holds a left-leaning editorial bias and sometimes relies on sources that have failed fact checks. Further, while The Guardian has failed several fact checks, they also produce an incredible amount of content; therefore, most stories are accurate, but the reader must beware, and hence why we assign them a Mixed rating for factual reporting.
