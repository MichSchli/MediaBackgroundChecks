History
Crisis Magazine (CM) is a religious-based news site. According to their
[about page](https://www.crisismagazine.com/about-us), “To this day, Crisis remains America’s most trusted source for authentic Catholic perspectives on Church and State, arts and culture, science and faith. We have one purpose, and one only: to proclaim Christ’s Kingship over all things, at all times, to all nations.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
While the stories on CM are well written and use factual sources, the sources rarely bear more than a passing relevance to the conclusions drawn. Crisis Magazine uses none of the over-the-top language of other biased sites on both ends; their extremism is evident in the tone and characterizations presented in the stories. Example: In the article
[“Does “Climate Change” Really Cause Hunger,”](http://www.crisismagazine.com/2017/climate-change-cause-hunger) CM repeats many of the half-truths and distorted “facts” popular among [climate change deniers](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) while presenting no links to any sources, credible or otherwise, for these claims.
Editorially, all stories favor a Christian Right perspective and sometimes use poor sources. Coating extremism in seemingly moderate terms makes it no less extreme, only easier to read.
