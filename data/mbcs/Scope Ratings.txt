History
Established in 2002,
[Scope Ratings](https://www.scoperatings.com/#!about/story) is a German credit rating agency that provides credit ratings and fund analyses for corporate and financial institutions. According to an [AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/) [interview](https://www.businessinsider.com/afp-german-ratings-minnow-takes-aim-at-us-whales-2016-8), Scope Ratings aim to challenge the oligopoly of big US rating agencies such as Moody’s, Fitch, and S&P Global. Scope Ratings is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. Torsten Hinrichs is the CEO. The [Scope Group](https://www.scopegroup.com/#/executive-board) is the parent company, and Florian Schoeller is the group’s founder, the largest shareholder, and Chief Executive Officer.

Analysis / Bias
In review, since the credit ratings are
[opinions](https://theconversation.com/qanda-why-credit-rating-agencies-matter-for-developing-countries-51964), these opinions come in the form of letter grades, such as those used by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and some other rating agencies: AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, etc., they are biased. The bias can be related to ownership bias, such as owners or top executives having connections to the government. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [reports](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_creditratings), “Many credit rating agencies are paid by the obligors they rate or by the issuers of the securities they rate,” and this creates a “conflict of interest,” and some credit rating agencies are paid by subscribers to their rating services, which are usually investors. Investors’ desire for low or high credit ratings, depending on their holdings and trading positions, may also present a conflict of interest.”
For example, Stefan Quandt, the heir of
[BMW](https://www.forbes.com/profile/stefan-quandt/#43440ee81e49) and served on the supervisory board of [Dresdner Bank](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Stefan_Quandt) AG, is one of the shareholders of Scope Ratings through his investment holding company, [AQTON](http://www.structuredcreditinvestor.com/article_loggedOut.asp?subtype=notloggedon&Status=8&SID=51763&ISS=22790). Stefan Quandt [donated](https://www.dw.com/en/bmw-donation-to-merkels-christian-democrats-prompts-criticism/a-17159007) 690,000 euros to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, and [DW](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/) reports BMW is a traditional source of [Christian Democrats (CDU)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/germany-media-profile/) income. Politico Europe also [reports](https://www.politico.eu/article/auto-giants-help-make-angela-merkels-conservatives-germanys-top-fundraisers/) on BMW’s donations to Merkel’s Christian Democrats, “BMW’s major shareholder and billionaire Stefan Quandt gave €50,000 each to both the CDU and liberal FDP,”. In June 2020, [The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)](https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-fines-scope-ratings-%E2%82%AC640000-failings-in-covered-bonds-ratings) fined Scope Ratings €640,000 and issued public notice.
Finally, they also publish research reports with minimally loaded language such as this,

In general, Scope Ratings leans right due to political affiliations with the right-leaning government.
