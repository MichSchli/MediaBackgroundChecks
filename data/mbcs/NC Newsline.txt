There is a lack of transparency as they do not disclose their political affiliation or their donors.

Analysis / Bias
In review, NC Newsline reports on public policy in NC from a progressive-liberal perspective. Articles and headlines contain moderate, but usually, minimally loaded language such as this
[Bill to allow concealed carry at churches with affiliated schools advances from committee.](http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2021/02/24/bill-to-allow-concealed-carry-at-churches-with-affiliated-schools-advances-from-committee/) This story, like most, is properly sourced to credible media outlets such as local papers the [Greensboro News and Record](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/greensboro-news-and-record/), [Charlotte Observer](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/charlotte-observer/) and local TV stations. Story selection almost always favors the left.
Editorially, all information aligns with the political left such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ equality, concern for climate change, income inequality, and gun reforms. In general, the news is reported factually, however, there is a significant lack of transparency regarding their mission and funding.
