Analysis / Bias
In review, Liberty Alliance was once on the
[Politifact fake news list](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/?platform=hootsuite). Currently, they do not produce original content and rather redirect to Liftable Media sites, such as Western Journal and Conservative Tribune. In other words, this is a curation website that does not produce original content.
