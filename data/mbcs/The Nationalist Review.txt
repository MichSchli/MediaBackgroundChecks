History
[Founded in 2017](https://whois.domaintools.com/nationalistreview.net) by [five unnamed journalists](https://www.nationalistreview.net/ethics-standards/), The Nationalist Review is a news and opinion website that reports from a populist, nationalist conservative perspective. According to their about us, they describe themselves as providing “Right Wing commentary for Nationalists and patriotic Americans.”
According to their
[FAQ page](https://www.nationalistreview.net/faq/), they are not an ethno-nationalist or white nationalist website. They also state the primary purpose of the website is to promote issues with immigration where they state “our immigration system has been abused and must be restricted, and we strongly desire for the extreme reduction of legal immigration and the deportation of all those here illegally. Frankly, some of us would like it to be halted permanently.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not name authors or provide bios and they do not explicitly name ownership.

Funded by / Ownership
The Nationalist Review does not clearly indicate ownership, however, the website is copyrighted to Brett McDonald and Paypal donations also lead to that name, therefore it would appear he is the primary owner. Not much is known about McDonald, though his profile on the
[far-right social media network Gab](https://www.adl.org/blog/another-white-supremacist-uses-gab-to-share-violent-racist-fantasies), reads “Unabashed Nationalist, #Trump2016 to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.” According to his [Quora profile](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-MacDonald-6) he “Studied Political Theory at Boston College.” Revenue is derived through advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Nationalist Review primarily publishes news stories from other sources with added right-wing commentary. News is broken into the categories “Politics” and “culture.” There is the frequent use of loaded emotional language that often portrays immigrants, people of color, and the political left negatively. For example, in this story, they use the headline
[New Black Panthers Shut Down Corner Store And Intimidate The Clerk With Firearm](https://www.nationalistreview.net/2020/09/18/new-black-panthers-shut-down-corner-store-and-intimidate-the-clerk-with-firearm/#), while it is possible this story is true, they only provide links to Twitter and an individual’s Instagram account. Therefore, they are forming an opinion without actual substantiated evidence. In another misleading story [Black Lives Matter Member Walks Into Retired Cop’s Bar And Murders Three People While Smiling](https://www.nationalistreview.net/2020/09/20/black-lives-matter-member-walks-into-retired-cops-bar-and-murders-three-people-while-smiling/), they make the claim that the murderer is a member of Black Lives Matter based on being black and wearing a Colin Kaepernick T-Shirt. They reference the Questionable right-wing conspiracy website [The Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), which also contains an error, stating he was wearing [Breonna Taylor T-shirt](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/09/black-lives-matter-activist-wearing-justice-beonna-taylor-shirt-walked-louisville-bar-murdered-three-people/). The Nationalist Review also fails to mention that one of the people killed in this incident [was black](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/09/21/louisville-police-bungalow-joes-shooting-no-evidence-about-race/5855986002/).
Editorially, all stories on this website favor the nationalist right and frequently support President Donald Trump such as this
[Call Them: These Four Republican Traitors Want To Prevent Trump From Replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://www.nationalistreview.net/2020/09/19/call-them-these-four-republican-traitors-want-to-prevent-trump-from-replacing-ruth-bader-ginsburg/). In general, The Nationalist Review publishes stories and commentary that align with the far-right and promote nationalism.
