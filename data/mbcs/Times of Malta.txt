Analysis / Bias
We analyzed dozens of articles and feature two example articles for review. The first article,
[“Abela to demand Steward reimburses funds it should have used for investment,”](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/abela-demand-steward-reimburses-funds-used-investment.1018845) maintains a neutral tone towards [Prime Minister Robert Abela](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/malta-media-profile/). It discusses Abela’s call for Steward Healthcare to reimburse government funds following a court decision that annulled a healthcare management deal. The article is factual but relies on circular sourcing within the Times of Malta, which could limit its credibility. However, it does focus on a primary source, the Prime Minister’s statement.
The second article,
[“As it happened: Hillman charged with financial crimes, given bail,”](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/adrian-hillman-to-be-charged-with-financial-crimes.875419) also maintains a neutral tone despite a potential conflict of interest. The article discusses legal proceedings against Adrian Hillman, the former managing director of Allied Newspapers, the parent company of Times of Malta. It provides a detailed account of the court proceedings and focuses on factual reporting.
Additionally, under the
[World News section](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/listing/world), the Times of Malta republishes articles from [ AFP (Agence France-Presse)](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), a reputable international news agency, enhancing its overall credibility.
