In review, Erin Advocate uses low biased wording when reporting local news such as this:
[Town of Erin to establish more digital signs for fire department](https://www.orangeville.com/news-story/10682687-town-of-erin-to-establish-more-digital-signs-for-fire-department/). The national news is derived through the [Canadian Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-canadian-press/), while world news comes from the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/).
Editorially, a review of op-eds slightly favors the left. In general, they are fact-based and hold a left-leaning editorial bias.
