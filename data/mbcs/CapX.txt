Analysis / Bias
CapX publishes news and analysis from a conservative perspective using loaded emotional wording such as this
[Why Labour’s talk of ending ‘tax breaks’ for private schools is a dangerous deceit](https://capx.co/why-labours-talk-of-ending-tax-breaks-for-private-schools-is-a-dangerous-deceit/). This story is minimally sourced. [In another story](https://capx.co/in-sadiq-khans-world-everyone-else-is-a-culture-warrior/), they rely on sources such as [The Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/london-evening-standard/) and [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/).
Editorially, the articles published by CapX.co demonstrate a clear right-leaning or conservative bias in their content and perspectives. This bias is evident through the consistent alignment of the articles with conservative ideologies and viewpoints. For example, the article “
[Free speech is not hate speech – whatever the authoritarian left try to tell you](https://capx.co/free-speech-is-not-hate-speech-whatever-the-authoritarian-left-try-to-tell-you/)” exhibits a right-leaning bias by critiquing the left for allegedly suppressing conservative voices, aligning with the right’s defense of free speech against perceived left-wing censorship.
When reporting on scientific matters such as climate change, they do not deny the existence of human-influenced global warming; however, they support free-market solutions over government intervention:
[Greta and her fanclub need to get real about the climate challenge.](https://capx.co/greta-and-her-fanclub-need-to-get-real-about-the-climate-challenge/) In general, CapX is mostly factual due to poor sourcing and hold right-leaning conservative editorial biases.
