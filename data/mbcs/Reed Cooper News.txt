History
The domain reedcooper.net was purchased in 2017 and
[registered](http://whois.domaintools.com/reedcooper.net) to Reed Cooper from Virginia. According to their [about page](https://www.reedcooper.net/about-us.html), Reed Cooper News is founded and written by a 14-year-old of the same name. They describe the website as “Reed Cooper News supports America and President Trump. Reed Cooper News combats the many liberal fake news outlets. We fight for America and for Trump every day! The Liberal outlets will continue to spew anti-American news, Reed Cooper News will not.”
Funded by / Ownership
The website states that it is owned by Reed Cooper. They also list another author named Gene Van Shaar who appears to be a self-published author through a company called the
[Clear Creek Institute](https://www.clearcreekcanyonpress.com/), which we find little information. The website generates revenue through advertising and a [shop](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/ReedCooper) that sells branded Pro-Trump merchandise.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Reed Cooper News publishes pro-Trump propaganda, with every story favoring his administration. There is the use of loaded language in headlines such as this:
[Pelosi Has Mental Breakdown, Throws Fit Over Supreme Court Approving Trump’s Wall](https://www.reedcooper.net/breaking-news/pelosi-has-mental-breakdown-throws-fit-over-supreme-court-approving-trumps-wall). This story features an unflattering image of Nancy Pelosi next to a photo of a smiling Trump. In another loaded piece, [Trump Slams Al Sharpton For Baltimore Response: He ‘Hates Whites & Cops’,](https://www.reedcooper.net/breaking-news/trump-slams-al-sharpton-for-baltimore-response-he-hates-whites-cops) the same biased tactic of using side by side photos is used. This story is also sourced to the Questionable [Breitbart.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/)
The website also features a section for voting polls, which again uses Photoshopped photos to bias the voter in favor of the right. Another section called
[Qanon,](https://www.reedcooper.net/qanon) reports favorable news in support of the conspiracy group. In general, Reed Cooper News is an extreme right propaganda and conspiracy source.
