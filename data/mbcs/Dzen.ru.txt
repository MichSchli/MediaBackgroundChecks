Analysis / Bias
Our analysis of Dzen.ru’s content bias, particularly within the
[“News”](https://dzen.ru/news?issue_tld=ru&utm_referrer=dzen.ru) section, is complex due to its algorithm-driven nature, which personalizes content based on user interactions. This personalization can create echo chambers, reinforcing users’ views without introducing diverse perspectives. Additionally, operating within Russia under Yandex and now VK means that Dzen.ru is subject to the Russian regulatory framework governing digital media and online content. This environment can impact the platform’s content policies, data privacy practices, and even the range of topics that can be freely discussed or promoted.
In review, the news sources aggregated on Dzen.ru cover a broad spectrum of topics, including international and domestic events, with a notable focus on political and social issues. For example, one article we analyzed discusses the doping case involving figure skater
[Kamila Valieva](https://dzen.ru/news/story/Yle_vprobe_Valievoj_nashli_razreshennyj_preparat_sanabolicheskim_ehffektom--336cf3725cf1d4a9d2147b78f4bf5df9?lang=ru&from=main_portal&fan=1&stid=F9Bc5kFxG5gjxjRU9xmf&t=1706894804&persistent_id=2769639050&tst=1706895395&story=265cd75b-679c-50e8-9f95-ab032e267bf8&issue_tld=ru&utm_referrer=dzen.ru), citing various sources, including Finnish broadcaster [Yle](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/yle-news-yle-fi/) and Russian outlets like RBC and lenta.ru.

Additionally, the report on the [rising syphilis](https://dzen.ru/news/story/Amerike_grozit_nebyvalaya_ehpidemiya._Prichina_vdvojne_stydnaya--bde06f66d3717e4bc01fc61b102e7121?lang=ru&rubric=United_States&fan=1&stid=agy5qUFmTlyt7cQaToPu&t=1706900137&persistent_id=2769629379&story=01aa9f7a-b46b-58c5-91b3-61b4070b8df1&issue_tld=ru) cases in the United States utilizes credible sources such as [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/citylab/). However, it also references sources like NewsFrol and AMITEL, whose credibility is not established. It’s important to note that the curation also involves sources like [Tass](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russian-news-agency-tass/) and [RT News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), rated as ‘factually mixed’ by Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC).
Given the mix of source credibility and potential state influence, Dzen.ru holds a right-leaning bias in support of the government and is not always fact-based due to relying on sources who fail fact checks.
