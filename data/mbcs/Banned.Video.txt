Analysis / Bias
In review, Banned.Video republishes videos with a short text description from various right-wing conspiracy theorists such as
[Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [David Icke](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/david-icke/), [The HighWire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-highwire/), [National File](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-file/), and [Mike Adams from Natural News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/natural-news/). As stated, almost all videos promote either conspiracy such as this [International Response to Trump Reveals Who Is In The Cabal](https://banned.video/watch?id=5fab499c0ad7422090a9d821) or pseudoscience such as this [What 5G & Corona-Vax Have in Common](https://banned.video/watch?id=5fa452ed65f2d419a089d931). Essentially, they promote the same as what would be found on the Infowars website or other similar conspiracy websites that align with the right.
During the post-election of Joe Biden for President, Banned.Video has and is promoting misleading/unproven information regarding election fraud against Donald Trump. For example,
[#MaidenGate! Dems Using Women’s MAIDEN names to Cast multiple votes for them??](https://banned.video/watch?id=5fab33140ad7422090a95180) This claim has been proven to be false [Intelligence Insider: President Trump Setup Democrats In “Sting Operation” To Catch Them Stealing Election!](https://banned.video/watch?id=5fa480cc65f2d419a08b54e2) This claim is rated [Pants on Fire](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/facebook-posts/did-president-trump-issue-secret-watermarks-ballot/) by [Politifact](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politifact/). Finally, they also promote misinformation regarding [CoronaVirus](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-mask-misinformation/) as well as [Climate Change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/). In general, Banned.Video is not a reliable source of information on any level.
