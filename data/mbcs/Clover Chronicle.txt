Analysis / Bias
In review, The Clover Chronicle regularly publishes conspiracy theories such as
[“Hillary Clinton Allegedly Covered Up Elite Pedophile Ring While Serving As Secretary Of State.”](https://cloverchronicle.com/2019/06/19/hillary-clinton-allegedly-covered-up-elite-pedophile-ring-while-serving-as-secretary-of-state/) The article links to doctored videos, conspiracy sites such as [Newspunch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-punch/), and the thoroughly discredited [Infowars.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) Other questionable sources utilized are [ZeroHedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/) and the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/).
Occasionally, The Clover Chronicle links to credible sources such as
[The Modesto Bee](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-modesto-bee/); however, the article is misleading. A quote from the [article](https://cloverchronicle.com/2019/06/17/school-cell-tower-shuts-down-after-teachers-and-students-diagnosed-with-cancer/) reads, “A cell phone tower located on school grounds in Ripon, California has been shut down after three teachers and four children were diagnosed with cancer” however, the Modesto Bee [article](https://www.modbee.com/news/article228538324.html) does not mention three teachers and four children diagnosed with cancer. In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left. They also routinely publish false and misleading information.
Since 2020, they have routinely published misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccines and
[election fraud conspiracies](https://cloverchronicle.com/2020/12/01/whistleblower-dominion-contractor-reveals-how-unsecured-usb-flash-drives-could-have-caused-election-fraud-on-massive-scale/) espoused by Donald Trump and his allies. This website generally promotes an extreme-right ideology that is usually misleading or false.
