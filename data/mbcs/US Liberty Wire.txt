Analysis / Bias
In review, US Liberty Wire does not produce original content, but rather opines on existing news stories. There is significant use of loaded emotional language such as this:
[Sarah Sanders Drops Hammer On Joe Biden For Attacking Trump, Exposes Joe As Historical Fraud](https://uslibertywire.com/sarah-sanders-drops-hammer-on-joe-biden-for-attacking-trump-exposes-joe-as-historical-fraud/). This story contains zero hyperlinked sources of information. Although they do not use hyperlinks for sourcing they do indicate quotes from Mixed factual sources such as the [Daily Wire](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-wire/) and questionable sources such as the [Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). They also offer commentary on credible sources such as the [New York Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) and the [New York Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/). In general, story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left through the use of poor sources or misleading opinions. This is an extreme right propaganda website.
