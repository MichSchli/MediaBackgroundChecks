[ “Moon’s Carbon Neutrality Plans Are Pipe Dreams](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/06/25/2021062501164.html),” [“Ruling Party Is Tainted with Lawmakers’ Corruption,”](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/06/24/2021062401154.html) and [“Opposition Sweeps By-Elections in Blow to Ruling Party.”](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/04/08/2021040801026.html?related_all) When reporting South Korean national news, The Chosun Ilbo’s reporting favor the opposition party (right-center People Power Party-PPP) with a positive tone such as [“New Members Flock to PPP After Young Leader’s Election.”](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/06/17/2021061701067.html)

[“Moon’s Approval Plummets Among Young Women](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/07/20/2020072001931.html),” [“Moon’s Approval Rating Plummets](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/08/18/2020081801798.html),” and “ [Why Should Taxpayers Pay for Moon’s Folly?](http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/06/02/2021060201532.html)“ When it comes to sourcing, they rarely provide links to their sources, making it difficult to verify the context and accuracy of stories.
