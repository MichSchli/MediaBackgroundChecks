Funded by / Ownership
Investing.com lacks transparency as they do not disclose the new owner that is only described as an “Asian Fund.” The former owner was Dror Efrat who
[sold](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/dror-efrat-sells-investing-com-stakes-to-a-foreign-fund/) the website in April 2021. Advertising and sponsored content fund the business.
Analysis / Bias
Investing.com primarily reports on economics, financial markets, and investing. The website features a wide variety of stock tickers/tools and profiles of businesses on the global exchange markets. The information on companies is fact-based and derived from financial data and market prices. Investing.com also provides news stories such as this
[California governor orders review of death row inmate’s conviction](https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/california-governor-orders-review-of-death-row-inmates-conviction-2518638). News stories are typically republished from reliable sources such as [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) and [Bloomberg](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bloomberg/).
Editorially, they provide a section titled
[Analysis and Opinion](https://www.investing.com/analysis/), where writers offer advice and opinions on investing. Many of the writers reviewed appear to be bloggers who have their own websites, such as [Is Gold Setting Up For A Rally Above $2000 Again?](https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gold-setting-up-for-a-rally-above-2000-again-200582911) This article is written by [Chris Vermeulen](https://www.investing.com/members/contributors/35127), who operates a website called the [Gold and Oil Guy](https://www.thegoldandoilguy.com/). Essentially, this article is sponsored content where Chris Vermeulen is promoting his website on a highly trafficked website (investment.com receives 170+ million page views per month).
As reviewers, it is difficult to determine the credibility of the bloggers. For example, one blogger is a retired
[Ophthalmologists](https://www.investing.com/analysis/emini-breaks-above-4000-big-round-number-200571287), and while he may be a self-taught expert with years of experience, we really don’t know his qualifications. Another article comes from a website called Contrarian Outlook, [“These Ignored 6.5% Dividends Will Be The Biggest Story Of 2021”](https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-ignored-65-dividends-will-be-the-biggest-story-of-2021-200560785), which may or may not be a reliable source of information. Finally, after reviewing dozens of analysis pieces, the aim of the agreement is to produce large quantities of content for investing.com while providing marketing opportunities for the writers.
Investing.com provides low-biased factual information as it relates to company profiles, stock prices, and world news. However, they lack credibility when it relates to the transparency of ownership and the qualifications of their authors.
