History
[Founded in 1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Review-Journal), The Las Vegas Review-Journal is a major daily newspaper published in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is Nevada’s largest circulating daily newspaper and one of two daily newspapers in the Las Vegas area. In 2015, the newspaper was secretly bought by [Sheldon Adelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Adelson) through News + Media Capital Group LLC. Sheldon Adelson is a billionaire known for [donating](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/07/sheldon-adelson-donates-30-million-for-house-republicans/) large sums of money to Republicans, including Donald Trump. After Adelson purchased the paper, editorial changes led to many reporters and editors [leaving the newspaper](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477423367/more-journalists-leaving-las-vegas-review-journal-after-sale-to-billionaire), citing “curtailed editorial freedom, murky business dealings, and unethical managers.” Longtime columnist John L. Smith resigned after being told he could no longer write anything about Adelson, a frequent focus of his reporting. Within six months, all three reporters who broke the story of Adelson’s ownership had left the paper.
Sheldon Adelson passed away on January 11, 2021, after a long illness.
