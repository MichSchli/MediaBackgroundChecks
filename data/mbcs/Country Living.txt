Analysis / Bias
Country Living publishes news and information on home decor, DIY tips, country lifestyle, and renovations with minimal bias, such as this
[How to Plant a Fall Garden](https://www.countryliving.com/gardening/garden-ideas/a33754584/how-to-plant-fall-garden/). The information in articles is properly sourced to credible media outlets.
Editorially, Country Living does not report on politics, but they report on politicians related to the theme of country living. For example, they report favorably on Joe Biden, such as this
[Joe Biden Consoled Meghan McCain in a Deeply Moving Moment on The View](https://www.countryliving.com/life/a46120/joe-biden-meghan-mccain-the-view/). When reporting on former President Trump, they usually maintained a neutral tone such as this [The White House Releases the Christmas Portrait of Donald and Melania Trump](https://www.countryliving.com/life/a46142/donald-melania-trump-white-house-christmas-portrait-2017/). In general, Country Living is fact-based and apolitical.
