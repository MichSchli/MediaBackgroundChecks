Analysis / Bias
In review, Florida Daily reports news with a conservative bias. The primary focus is on Florida news and politics. Articles are published using strong, emotionally loaded language such as
[“Thanks to New Buyers, Florida Gun Sales Continue to Increase Despite Ammo Shortage.”](https://www.floridadaily.com/thanks-to-new-buyers-florida-gun-sales-continue-to-increase-despite-ammo-shortage/) Story selection usually favors the right and denigrates the left, such as this [“Democrats Out of Touch on Education, Polls Show.”](https://www.floridadaily.com/democrats-out-of-touch-on-education-polls-show/)
When sourcing information, they typically rely on quotes rather than hyperlinking, which is inappropriate for an online publication. They also republish articles from credible sources such as RealClearEducation.
Editorially, most op-eds favor the right and highlight Republican politicians, such as this
[Bill Posey in Great Shape to Win Reelection in Florida](https://www.floridadaily.com/bill-posey-in-great-shape-to-win-reelection-in-florida/). When reporting on scientific issues such as vaccines, we could not find any instances of misinformation. Although they do not favor government interventions regarding [climate change](https://www.floridadaily.com/nikki-fried-backs-bill-from-boca-raton-democrats-to-create-climate-change-mitigation-strategy/), they do not deny that climate change is human-influenced. Florida Daily is generally moderately right-biased and usually factual; however, the lack of transparency and hyperlinked sourcing renders them Mixed for factual reporting.
