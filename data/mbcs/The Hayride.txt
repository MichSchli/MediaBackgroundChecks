Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hayride primarily reports on Louisiana and national politics. Local political news reporting is often opinion based and uses loaded emotional wording such as this:
[SADOW: Edwards Is Awfully Ironic In Accusing Rispone Of Lacking Detail](https://thehayride.com/2019/10/sadow-edwards-is-awfully-ironic-in-accusing-rispone-of-lacking-detail/). This story is properly sourced from numerous high factual sources such as the [Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/) and [Pew Research](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pew-research/). Story selection always favors the right and often endorses former President Trump, such as this: [BURLAND: Louisiana Should Dump JBE If We Want To Join The Trump Economy](https://thehayride.com/2019/10/burland-louisiana-should-dump-jbe-if-we-want-to-join-the-trump-economy/). National news stories also feature-loaded emotional wording that favors the right, [CROUERE: Deep State Hates Trump’s America-First Policy](https://thehayride.com/2019/10/crouere-deep-state-hates-trumps-america-first-policy/).
When it comes to reporting on scientific issues such as climate change, some of their authors are not in agreement with the consensus that humans are a significant driver of climate change. In this
[article](https://thehayride.com/2019/09/crouere-climate-change-extremists-need-to-chill-out/), they state, “Ironically, despite the hysteria, there is no scientific consensus that man-made [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is even real, Numerous studies, such as the [research](http://climatechangereconsidered.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Global-Warming-Surprises-AT-2017.pdf) conducted by S. Fred Singer, show that the theory that climate change is man-made is “in dispute.”
Singer is best known for his
[denial of the health risks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446867/) of second-hand smoke. In 2005, the left-leaning [Mother Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/mother-jones/) magazine [described Singer](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2005/05/put-tiger-your-think-tank/) as a “godfather of global warming denial.” [In August 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Singer) Newsweek reported that in April 1998, a dozen people from what it called “the denial machine” met at the [American Petroleum Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute)‘s Washington headquarters. The meeting included Singer’s group, the [George C. Marshall Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Marshall_Institute), and ExxonMobil. Newsweek said that, according to an eight-page memo that was leaked, the meeting proposed a $5-million campaign to convince the public that the science of global warming was controversial and uncertain. The plan was leaked to the press and never implemented. Lastly, according to Jeffrey Masters, Ph.D. Director of Meteorology, [Weather Underground:](https://www.wunderground.com/)
[Singer] has testified before
[Congress]numerous times, and is probably the most widely quoted skeptic on the [ozone hole]and [global warming]issues. Unfortunately, Dr. Singer cannot be considered an active [scientist]publishing in the [peer-reviewed]literature, or even an objective informed critic. Dr. Singer touts himself as having “published more than 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers over the course of his career”. However, Dr. Singer’s contributions to atmospheric science have been essentially zero since 1971.
During Covid-19, they made false claims, such as claiming that
[masks harm the healthy](https://archive.ph/hcHDl). They don’t. They also promoted the false stolen election narrative citing the 2000 Mules Documentary, which has been [thoroughly debunked](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2022/05/fact-check-2000-mules-does-not-prove-2020-election-was-stolen-documentary-contains-lots-of-holes-assumptions.html).
In general, The Hayride holds far-right biased and often promotes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience to advance their editorial positions.
