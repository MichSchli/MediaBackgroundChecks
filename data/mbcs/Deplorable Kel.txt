History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/deplorablekel.com), Deplorable Kel is a news and opinion blog/website with a conservative bias in reporting. According to their [about page](https://deplorablekel.com/about/), “Deplorable Kel is an independent journalist from California who covers news that the mainstream media refuses to report on. Kel covers anti-American candidates running in the U.S. elections, terrorism, crimes committed by illegal aliens, and the indoctrination of children through schools and media.” Although the website features an about page, there is no disclosure of ownership or a name attributed to the independent journalist. Therefore, this source lacks transparency.
