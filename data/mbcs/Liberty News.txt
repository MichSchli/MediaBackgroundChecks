History
Founded in the early days of the Tea Party movement by Grassfire a conservative network founded by Steve Elliott, Liberty News is primarily a conservative news aggregator. According to their
[about page](https://www.libertynews.com/about), “LibertyNEWS serves primarily as a liberty-fed news aggregator, with a unique emphasis. We don’t simply provide you with long lists of articles. Instead, we curate those articles around themes so you can stay “on topic” instead of just bouncing around from topic to topic.” [Read our profile on the United States media and government. ](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)

Analysis / Bias
Liberty News mostly publishes aggregated/curated conservative news stories that link offsite. A review of sources indicates that many are not credible such as the
[Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/), [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/), [Zerohedge](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/zero-hedge/), [American Thinker](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-thinker/), and discredited Youtube videos. Although in the minority, they occasionally link to more credible outlets such as [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/) and [Politico](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/politico/).
We could not find any original content. Therefore, Liberty News is a questionable source based on linking to sources that have failed 100s of fact checks.
Failed Fact Checks
- None by Liberty News, but 100s by the sources they curate news from.
