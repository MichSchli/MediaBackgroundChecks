History
[Founded in 2020](http://whois.domaintools.com/americasnewssource.com), America’s News Source is a hyper-partisan conservative news blog that publishes false information. The website completely lacks transparency as they do not provide an about or list the names of ownership.
Funded by / Ownership
America’s News Source does not disclose ownership, and there does not appear to be a revenue model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, America’s News Source blatantly plagiarizes whole articles from other sources. For instance, this unsourced story
[After Years Of Trashing Trump Robert De Niro’s Criminal Child Sex Secrets Come Tumbling Out](https://americasnewssource.com/after-years-of-trashing-trump-robert-de-niros-criminal-child-sex-secrets-come-tumbling-out/), is copied word for word from another fake news source called [Daily USA News](http://newstv3.com/?p=164). In another story, [Michelle Obama Assembles 2020 ‘Voting Squad’ – It’s Packed With Hollywood Millionaires](https://americasnewssource.com/michelle-obama-assembles-2020-voting-squad-its-packed-with-hollywood-millionaires/), they copy directly from the Patriot Journal. In general, stories favor extreme right positions and often denigrate the left and promote former President Donald Trump.
Failed Fact Checks
[Says a “fact check” shows that Nancy Pelosi moved “billions of Social Security funds to cover impeachment costs.”](https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2020/jan/22/blog-posting/satire-fact-check-headline-pelosi-impeachment-cost/)– Pants on Fire
