Originating as a [student project](https://corp.greekreporter.com/?_gl=1*1lxkvt6*_ga*MTExODEwMTE3LjE3MDE0MDM0NDQ.*_ga_8N0C9SG894*MTcwMTQzMzU2MC4yLjEuMTcwMTQzNTc2OC40NC4wLjA.#:~:text=This%20form%20of%20online%20advertising,attracting%20a%20high%20impression%20rate) at California State University Northridge, it was initially focused on the Greek community in the entertainment industry.

Analysis / Bias
Greek Reporter primarily covers news related to Greece and the Greek diaspora, focusing on culture, politics, and society. Although it generally upholds factual reporting, some articles show emotional language and subjective framing. For example,”
[Exclusive: The Greek Who Lived in North Korea Tells Her Story”](https://greekreporter.com/2017/10/14/exclusive-the-greek-who-lived-in-north-korea-tells-her-story/) positively frames [North Korea](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/north-korea-government-and-media-profile/) through emotionally loaded language, contradicting its neutral title. Statements like “They are very proud people… they get punished by the West” and describing North Korea’s nuclear program as “defensive” suggests a tendency to present international issues with subjectivity, particularly in interview-based articles.
The coverage of Greek politics contrasts how different leaders are portrayed. In
[“Alexis Tsipras: Who is Greece’s New Prime Minister?](https://greekreporter.com/2015/01/26/alexis-tsipras-greece-new-prime-minister-profile-bio/)“, there’s a critical tone towards Alexis Tsipras, emphasizing contradictions in his campaign promises and casting doubt on his leadership capabilities. The term “crushing defeat” in [“SYRIZA Leader Alexis Tsipras Resigns”](https://greekreporter.com/2023/06/29/syriza-leader-alexis-tsipras-resigns/) adds a dramatic and negative connotation to Tsipras’s electoral loss, suggesting bias. In contrast, “ [Mitsotakis Outlines Greek Government Plan for the Next Four Years” ](https://greekreporter.com/2023/07/06/mitsotakis-greek-government-next-four-years/)portrays Kyriakos Mitsotakis positively, focusing on his optimistic plans and visions for Greece.
This contrasting approach suggests a potential bias in the Greek Reporter’s political coverage. The Greek Reporter generally relies on direct quotes and circular sourcing, limiting external verification. It also
[cites](https://greekreporter.com/2023/07/06/mitsotakis-greek-government-next-four-years/) sources like [Proto Thema](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/proto-thema/#google_vignette), which has a mixed factual rating, potentially impacting the overall credibility of its reporting.
