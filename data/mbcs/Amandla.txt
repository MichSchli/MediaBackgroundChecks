Analysis / Bias
In review, Amandla provides coverage and analysis of current political, economic, and social processes from far left perspectives. They feature articles written by and for activists in political, labor, and popular organizations and progressive intellectuals at the universities, in NGOs, parliament, community-based organizations, churches, journalists, lawyers, public officials in state institutions, etc. Articles and headlines often feature-loaded emotional wording that favors the left, such as
[Pandemic, gives us a last chance to avert climate – and social – catastrophe](http://aidc.org.za/pandemic-gives-us-a-last-chance-to-avert-climate-and-social-catastrophe/). All stories are reasonably sourced.
Editorially, Amandla strongly favors the left, taking positions supporting the science of
[human-influenced climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), workers’ rights, unionization, and support for LGBTQ.
