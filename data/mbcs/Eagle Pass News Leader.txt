Analysis / Bias
In review, The Eagle Pass News Leader focuses on news from Eagle Pass, Texas, and uses staff writers for local news. News articles often contain emotional wording:
[10-month-old migrant baby found dead, drowned at the Rio Grande](https://www.epnewsleader.com/feed/10-month-old-migrant-baby-found-dead-drowned-at-the-rio-grande). While we hope this story is not true, we hope it is not, as there is no single hyperlink to validate it. This is the norm for most stories on this site. The website tends to focus on [negative stories regarding immigrants](https://www.epnewsleader.com/feed/mother-of-five-27-shot-and-killed-at-a-del-rio-convenience-store).
In general, there is minimal to zero sourcing of information, and most stories favor the right regarding immigrants.
