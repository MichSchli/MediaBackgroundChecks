History
[Founded in 1916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution), The Brookings Institution is an American research group. It conducts research and education in the social sciences, primarily in economics, metropolitan policy, governance, foreign policy, and global economy and development. The [mission](https://web.archive.org/web/20100430053631/http://www.brookings.edu/about.aspx) of the Brookings Institution is to “provide innovative and practical recommendations that advance three broad goals: strengthen American democracy; foster the economic and social welfare, security and opportunity of all Americans; and secure a more open, safe, prosperous, and cooperative international system.”

An
[academic analysis](https://web.archive.org/web/20110608074559/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/groseclose/pdfs/MediaBias.pdf) of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referred to by conservative politicians almost as frequently as liberal politicians, earning 53 on a 1–100 scale, with 100 representing the most liberal score. Further, Brookings has been accused of having a [liberal bias](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/03/03/think-tank-employees-tend-to-support-democrats) and a [conservative bias](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/americas/16iht-gitmo.1.17859399.html); however, the consensus is they are [centrist](https://fair.org/extra/study-finds-first-drop-in-think-tank-cites/).
Brookings utilizes moderately loaded language in their headlines and articles, such as this:
[Don’t ignore the national debt. It will only get worse if we don’t act now](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/dont-ignore-the-national-debt-it-will-only-get-worse-if-we-dont-act-now/). This article and all others are properly sourced and labeled appropriately as an Op-Ed. Brookings also publishes their research on the website: [Empowering women entrepreneurs in developing countries.](https://www.brookings.edu/research/empowering-women-entrepreneurs-in-developing-countries/) Their research provides deep sourcing from credible information and outlets. In general, the Brookings website’s scope of stories and information tends to lean left politically slightly.
