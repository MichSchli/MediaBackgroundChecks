History
Founded in 2001, The Center for Global Development (CGD) is an “independent and non-partisan group that works to reduce global poverty and inequality through rigorous research and active engagement with the policy community to make the world a more prosperous, just, and safe place for us all.”
CGD was ranked the
[13th most prominent think tank](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=think_tanks) in the international development sphere by the University of Pennsylvania’s “2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
According to their funding page, “The Center for Global Development is an independent, nonpartisan research institution and a 501(c)(3) organization, supported by contributions from individuals, foundations, bilateral organizations, and corporations.” The website
[openly lists](https://www.cgdev.org/section/funding) its donors, most coming from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Philanthropy Project.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Center for Global Development (CGD) promotes combating global poverty, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting pro-science positions such as vaccination in developing countries. Further, the website reports on
[sustainable development](https://www.cgdev.org/topics/sustainable-development-finance) and [Gender and Equality](https://www.cgdev.org/topics/gender-equality). The website also features a [blog](https://www.cgdev.org/section/opinions/blogs) that reports news and analysis from a left-leaning perspective. For example, this story: [Russia, DFC, and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Idea Buried in the Spending Law](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/russia-dfc-and-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-idea-buried-spending-law). This story, like most, is correctly sourced to credible outlets such as House.gov, Congress.gov, and the DFC.
The website frequently reports on the dangers of
[climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) and denigrates the former Trump administration, such as this: [Trump’s Strangest Trade Idea Yet](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/trumps-strangest-trade-idea-yet). In general, the CGD reports factually but offers a left-leaning perspective by promoting liberal-leaning causes.
