Analysis / Bias
El Financiero specializes in financial news, as seen in articles like
[“Generación de empleos vive su mejor momento en la última década, informa el IMSS.”](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/2023/08/07/generacion-de-empleos-vive-su-mejor-momento-en-la-ultima-decada-informa-el-imss/) The article references the IMSS (Mexican Social Security Institute) but does not include direct links to the reports. Instead, it uses circular hyperlinks to other content on its site. This approach is consistent across many of their articles, which typically do not link to external sources.
In addition to financial news, El Financiero also covers national politics. In our review, we analyzed two articles about President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Left-Leaning). The first article, titled
[“La derrota del Presidente,”](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/opinion/raymundo-riva-palacio/2023/06/02/la-derrota-del-presidente/) is an opinion piece that critiques the president’s approach to security. Notable quotes include him being “politically defeated” and “His morning press conferences have become an electrocardiogram of his frustrations and impotence,” suggesting a portrayal of an emotionally reactive and ineffective leader.
The second article,
[“AMLO responde a denuncia de Xóchitl Gálvez: ‘Yo no ofendo a las mujeres,'”](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/2023/07/12/amlo-responde-a-denuncia-de-xochitl-galvez-yo-no-ofendo-a-las-mujeres/) reports on the president’s response to accusations of gender-based political violence. While it presents his defense, the tone leans towards supporting Xóchitl Gálvez’s (Right-Leaning) perspective, especially with quotes emphasizing the president’s repeated mentions of her. In summary, El Financiero’s coverage of the left-leaning president is critical, often supporting criticisms raised against him. Hence El Finaciero is right-center biased and mostly factual due to poor sourcing techniques.
