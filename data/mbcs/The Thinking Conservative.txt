Analysis / Bias
The Thinking Conservative mostly aggregates news from far-right questionable sources such as the
[Epoch Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-epoch-times/), [Just The News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), and [The National Pulse](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-national-pulse/). We also found reliance on conspiracy/pseudoscience-oriented sites like [Children’s Health Defense](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/childrens-health-defense/) and [Bannon’s War Room](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/war-room-steve-bannon-bias/), all of which frequently publish false and misleading information.
Editorially, the stories they aggregate consistently favor a conservative perspective and denigrate the left, such as this
[Trump Targets Young Voters With Economic Rebirth Plan, Blasts Biden’s ‘Failed Presidency’](https://www.thethinkingconservative.com/trump-targets-young-voters-with-economic-rebirth-plan-blasts-bidens-failed-presidency/). The website also promotes conspiracy theories such as the 2020 election being stolen from Trump [Math Never Lies, the 2020 Election Was Stolen!](https://www.thethinkingconservative.com/math-never-lies-the-2020-election-was-stolen/), and numerous stories promoting [quackery-level pseudoscience](https://www.thethinkingconservative.com/?s=vaccine) related to the Covid-19 vaccine. In general, the Thinking Conservative is as reliable as the sources it uses. This results in a low factual and credibility rating.
Failed Fact Checks
- As a news aggregator, they have not been fact-checked by a third party; however, the sources they rely on routinely fail fact-checks.
