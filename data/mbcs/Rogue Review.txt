History

For example, they do not offer an about page to describe their conservative bias, disclose ownership, or editors.

Analysis / Bias
Rogue Review publishes news and commentary from a conservative perspective. Articles and headlines often contain highly emotional wording such as this
[NYPD Storms Restaurant and Persecute a CHILD While Rounding Up Unvaccinated Patrons](https://www.roguereview.net/nypd-storms-restaurant-and-persecutes-a-child-while-rounding-up-unvaccinated-patrons-full-clip/). An emotionally charged quote reads, “COVID insanity has also opened Americans’ eyes to some other less-ridiculed but much-complicit groups. Those include police, who are now essentially operating as a Gestapo carrying out government overreaches for the left, and onlookers who allow tyranny to occur.”
The website relies on various credible sources; however, they also utilize
[discredited sources](https://www.roguereview.net/robert-f-kennedy-jr-explains-how-big-pharma-is-gaining-protection-by-jabbing-kids-full-interview/) such as [Robert F. Kennedy](https://iffy.news/fact-check-search/?q=Robert%20F.%20Kennedy), who frequently publishes vaccine disinformation. Other questionable sources used include [Free West Media,](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/free-west-media/) [National Pulse](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-national-pulse/), and [The Gateway Pundit](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-gateway-pundit/). Further, after the 2020 Presidential election, they promoted false or misleading information such as this [BREAKING: Elections Expert Releases FULL Voter Fraud Report for 2020 Election, Suggests 8.1M Excess Votes](https://www.roguereview.net/breaking-elections-expert-releases-full-voter-fraud-report-for-2020-election-suggests-8-1m-excess-votes/). According to [fact-checkers](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/08/fact-check-nonexpert-trend-analysis-does-not-track-with-recent-election-results-to-prove-trump-won-2020.html), this is a baseless conspiracy theory.
Finally, they frequently promote Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation such as this
[Yale Study: Vaccinated People MORE LIKELY to Be Infected Than Those Without Jab (FULL DETAILS)](https://www.roguereview.net/yale-study-vaccinated-people-more-likely-to-be-infected-than-those-without-jab-full-details/?fbclid=IwAR2EzBzuchHjZCx7p4diUZrQqP-242Miwi10yvoQycl_7GRth2HNPjxS-Tc). In this story, they misrepresent the result of the study s with the author [confirming](https://hoax-alert.leadstories.com/2021/12/fact-check-study-does-not-say-vaccinated-people-more-likely.html) they got it wrong “Interpretation that our research is evidence of anything but a protective vaccine effect is a misrepresentation.” In general, Rogue Review presents news and commentary with a far-right bias that is not always factual.
