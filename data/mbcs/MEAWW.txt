Analysis / Bias
MEAWW primarily covers entertainment-related news such as this
[‘Doom Patrol’ Season 3 Episode 4 Review: A story of love, lies, and secrets.](https://meaww.com/doom-patrol-season-3-undead-patrol-dc-universe-hbo-mac-matt-bomer-spoilers-review-michelle-gomez) Entertainment news does not include political opinions but reflects the author’s opinion when performing reviews of TV, Movies, Music, etc.
Coverage of news also does not feature opinionated statements from the authors. However, news stories feature emotional headlines that attempt to entice clicks, such as this
[Brian Laundrie’s dad slammed for getting Dunkin Donuts goodies amid manhunt for son](https://meaww.com/brian-laundrie-dad-receives-dunkin-donuts-delivery-as-police-continue-manhunt-for-son-549541).
When reporting political news, they often choose stories negative toward the Biden administration, such as this
[Is Jill Biden’ co-president’? FLOTUS cuts in during Joe Biden interview to call migrant children camps’ humane’.](https://meaww.com/is-jill-biden-co-president-first-lady-cuts-potus-interview-migrant-children-camps-humane-reactions) Further, reporting on the former Trump administration often demonstrates a favorable tone such as this [Presidential debate 2020: Ivanka Trump slams Joe Biden for being typical politician with ‘all talk, no action](https://meaww.com/ivanka-trump-calls-joe-biden-all-talk-no-action-father-ran-president-politicans-like-him-debate-2020).
MEAWW is mixed in sourcing information; for example, some articles do not feature hyperlinked sourcing, while others correctly source from credible media outlets. In general, they hold a right-leaning bias with story selection and have published false information.
