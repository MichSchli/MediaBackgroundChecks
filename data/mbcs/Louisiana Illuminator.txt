Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page, the Louisiana Illuminator is part of
[States Newsroom](https://statesnewsroom.com/about/), a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit [supported by grants and a coalition of donors and readers](https://statesnewsroom.com/support/). States Newsroom publishes 28 other [publications](https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/). The Georgia Recorder is transparent as they link to the States Newsroom donors page. Initially, when they launched, they got fiscal sponsorship from the Hopewell Foundation; however, once the IRS approved their application for 501(c)(3) charity certification, they severed their ties with Hopewell Foundation. There has been criticism of their involvement with [the Hopewell Foundation,](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/mysterious-funders-behind-new-arizona-media-outlet-10870282) and they have responded to the criticism [here](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/a-few-friday-thoughts-on-what-the-arizona-mirror-is-and-isnt/).
