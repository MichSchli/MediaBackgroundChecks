Analysis / Bias
In review, Jezebel covers woman’s issues and politics with a left-leaning bias in story selection. Headlines contain moderately loaded language such as this:
[Donald Trump’s Name Is Worth $4 Billion, According to Himself](https://theslot.jezebel.com/donald-trumps-name-is-worth-4-billion-according-to-hi-1833644941), and this [Barbara Bush Talks Shit From Beyond the Grave.](https://theslot.jezebel.com/barbara-bush-talks-shit-from-the-beyond-the-grave-1833621812) Sourcing is generally from credible mainstream sources.
Editorially, Jezebel often denigrates the right and promotes the left through both wording and overall story selection. such as this
[Sen. Kyrsten Sinema Leaves Democratic Party to Avoid Getting Smoked in a Primary](https://jezebel.com/sen-kyrsten-sinema-leaves-democratic-party-to-avoid-ge-1849874215) and [Herschel Walker, Who Held a Gun to Ex-Wife’s Head, Closes Senate Campaign at a Gun Range](https://jezebel.com/herschel-walker-who-held-a-gun-to-ex-wifes-head-close-1849858493).
