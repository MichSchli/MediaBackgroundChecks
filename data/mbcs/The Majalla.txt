Analysis / Bias
In 2023
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked Saudi Arabia 170/180 in their [Press Freedom Index,](https://rsf.org/en/saudi-arabia) stating that “Saudi Arabia permits no independent media. The authorities keep Saudi journalists under close surveillance, even when they are abroad, as Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in Istanbul in October 2018 illustrated.” [Read our profile on Saudi Arabia’s Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/saudi-arabia-media-profile/)
In review, The Majalla poorly sources and does not provide hyperlinks, however when covering world news, they utilize credible sources such as
[AFP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), [AP](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/), and [Reuters](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reuters/) by republishing their articles. They also publish long-form analyses utilizing [Foreign Affairs](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/foreign-affairs/). In their headlines, The Majalla uses emotionally loaded language. While the news is generally reported factually, it is one-sided and consistently favorable to the Saudi Government, especially Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, such as [Peace.. A True Saudi Ideal](https://eng.majalla.com/node/47481/peace-a-true-saudi-ideal)”, and [“Saudi Crown Prince Warns of Escalation with Iran, Prefers Political Solution](https://eng.majalla.com/node/76796/saudi-crown-prince-warns-of-escalation-with-iran-prefers-political-solution).”
Another example is the
[Saudi Corruption Crackdown](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/saudi-arabia-nets-more-100-billion-corruption-crackdown-n842541) which was reported exclusively by western media such as the AP and [NBC news](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/), but not in the Saudi Press. The Majalla also frequently reports negatively on rival countries such as Iran, [“A New Regional Order in the Middle East](https://eng.majalla.com/node/77126/a-new-regional-order-in-the-middle-east).” In general, this is a source that promotes pro-state propaganda through excessive censorship that prohibits criticism of the government.
