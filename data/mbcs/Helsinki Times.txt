Analysis / Bias
In review, The Helsinki Times uses minimally emotionally loaded language when covering national politics, such as,
[“Centre, Swedish People’s Party at odds over mechanism for migrants in Mediterranean.”](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/politics/16822-centre-swedish-people-s-party-at-odds-over-mechanism-for-migrants-in-mediterranean.html) They also use neutral language when covering nationalistic, populist right-wing party leader Halla-aho, [“Halla-aho: “Is foreigners’ security taking precedence over that of Finns?”” ](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/politics/16984-halla-aho-is-foreigners-security-taking-precedence-over-that-of-finns.html)Further, when reporting on immigration-related news, they use a positive tone such as this, [“Study: Firms owned by immigrants create more jobs than those owned by native-born Finns”
](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/16417-study-firms-owned-by-immigrants-create-more-jobs-than-those-owned-by-native-born-finns.html)When covering [global warming](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/)they have published misleading information such as this: [“Finnish Scientists: Effect of human activity on climate change insignificant.”](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/16562-finnish-scientists-effect-of-human-activity-on-climate-change-insignificant.html)According to IFCN fact checker [Climate Feedback](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/climate-feedback/)this report is [Incorrect](https://climatefeedback.org/claimreview/non-peer-reviewed-manuscript-falsely-claims-natural-cloud-changes-can-explain-global-warming/?fbclid=IwAR0O73cVd6nXcpvFt7VBkqCDCNgNVp4APVSUdAqKOdjwbVMSFBljE9VZo-c). However, they do link to the Climate Feedback report, offering balance.
When it comes to sourcing the Helsinki Times utilizes domestic sources that are unknown to us, such as Uusi Suomi, as well as credible sources such as the Institute of the Finnish Economy (etla.fi),
[Helsingin Sanomat](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/helsingin-sanomat/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), and [BBC.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/) News coverage of the United States uses strong, emotionally loaded language, [“Did Trump tweet throughout his entire meeting with Niinistö?”](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/politics/16806-did-trump-tweet-throughout-his-entire-meeting-with-niinistoe.html)
