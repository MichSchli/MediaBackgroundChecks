History
[Launched in 1999](https://whois.domaintools.com/paulcraigroberts.org), PaulCraigRoberts.org is the website for economist and author Paul Craig Roberts. [Mr. Roberts](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/pages/about-paul-craig-roberts/) was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy during the Reagan administration. In the past, he was also an associate editor with the [Wall Street Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/). The website primarily promotes far-right conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
Since retiring, he has been accused of
[antisemitism](https://www.adl.org/news/article/ron-unz-controversial-writer-and-funder-of-anti-israel-activists) and [conspiracy theorizing](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching) by the [Anti-Defamation League](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/anti-defamation-league/) and the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching).

Analysis / Bias
PaulCraigRoberts.org primarily publishes the writings of Mr. Roberts and information on his appearances and interviews. The content is often conspiratorial and promotes white nationalism. For example, a quote from an
[article](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2022/09/10/the-death-of-the-deracinated-west-is-close-at-hand/) reads, “White people are doomed. Their very own institutions are against them. And they sit there insouciant, unaware. A pitiful end of a great race.”
Articles and headlines contain emotionally charged wording that favors the extreme right, such as
[The Death of the Deracinated West Is Close at Hand](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2022/09/10/the-death-of-the-deracinated-west-is-close-at-hand/) and [Biden Declares WAR on White America](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2022/09/07/biden-declares-war-on-white-america/). PaulCraigRoberts.org relies on poor sources who routinely promote disinformation, such as [Infowars](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/), [RT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/), and [SOTT Report](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/signs-of-the-times-sott/).
When not promoting White Nationalism, the website frequently advances conspiracy theories such as the 2020 election being stolen from Donald Trump:
[The Costs of a Stolen Election Mount.](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2022/07/14/the-costs-of-a-stolen-election-mount/) There is [no evidence](https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d) to support the election was stolen. Mr. Roberts also promotes Covid-19 conspiracy theories such as this [Is the Covid “vaccine” a Bioweapon?](https://web.archive.org/web/20211117121840/https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2021/10/04/is-the-covid-vaccine-a-bioweapon/) The answer to this is [no](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/nuremberg-code-addresses-experimentation-not-vaccines/). Finally, he promotes quackery-level pseudoscience [claiming](https://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2021/09/18/the-most-important-article-on-mrna-vaccination-you-will-ever-read/) that the “mRNA injection brings high risk of health injury and death.” [There is no evidence to support this claim](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-mrna-vaccines-idUSL1N2MC0VF). In general, the website consistently promotes extreme right conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
