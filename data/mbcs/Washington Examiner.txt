[Clarity Media Group](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Clarity_Media_Group), owned by [Philip Anschutz,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Anschutz) an American billionaire entrepreneur who describes himself as a “conservative Christian.” Anschutz is also the owner of the right-leaning [Weekly Standard](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/weekly-standard/) and has donated millions of dollars to right-leaning causes, including [anti-LGBT groups,](http://www.papermag.com/coachellas-problematic-owner-2522162908.html) such as the [Family Research Council](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/family-research-council/), which has been labeled a hate group.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Washington Examiner format and content have been compared to
[The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/), albeit with a [right-leaning tilt](https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/washington-examiner-newspaper-closing-becoming-weekly-magazine/). They generally report political news as well as local Washington DC news stories. The Washington Examiner frequently utilizes loaded wording in sensationalized headlines like [Trump’s manic Monday amid the Kavanaugh storm](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trumps-manic-monday-amid-the-kavanaugh-storm). While the headlines may be sensational, the articles’ content is written with less bias and tend to be adequately sourced to credible media outlets.
Editorially, the Washington Examiner is 100% right. It is virtually impossible to find a single editorial that offers balance. Most editorials have anti-left loaded headlines such as this:
[Obama, the Great Divider when in office, lacks the credibility to lecture America](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/obama-the-great-divider-when-in-office-lacks-the-credibility-to-lecture-america).
