Analysis / Bias
In review, DavidHarrisJr.com publishes summarized news stories with the addition of conservative commentary. News stories utilize highly emotional wording that favors the right such as this:
[Here are Ten White People Who Helped Destroy Their Cities After the Death of George Floyd](https://davidharrisjr.com/steven/here-are-ten-white-people-who-helped-destroy-their-cities-after-the-death-of-george-floyd/). This story is sourced from the factually mixed [Daily Caller](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-caller/). Another story reads [Traitor John Roberts…Unadulterated Liberal Hack in Charge of Supreme Court](https://davidharrisjr.com/steven/traitor-roberts-unadulterated-liberal-hack-in-charge-of-supreme-court/), which is unsourced. Story selection always favors the right and denigrates the left. In general, DavidHarrisJr.com promotes far-right propaganda and conspiracy theories, as evidenced below in failed fact checks.
