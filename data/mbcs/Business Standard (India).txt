Analysis / Bias
According to a BloombergQuint
[article](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/yes-bank-tries-to-blame-rival-for-bad-press) dated 2018, “Yes Bank has accused financial newspaper Business Standard of publishing malicious and defamatory news reports, suggesting this was done at the behest of Uday Kotak, owner of the newspaper and rival Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.”
In review, Business Standard publishes articles with emotionally loaded language and with a pro-Narendra Modi tone such as
[“A different Modi: The PM is no longer shy of showing his real hand”](https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/a-different-modi-the-pm-is-no-longer-shy-of-showing-his-real-hand-121021201637_1.html) and [“Q4 GDP numbers: Carving FY22 recovery amidst Covid setbacks.”](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/q4-gdp-numbers-carving-fy22-recovery-amidst-covid-setbacks-121053101267_1.html) The Business Standard also republishes articles such as [“Covid-19 pandemic an opportunity to reshape world order: PM Modi,”](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/pm-modi-calls-for-united-global-efforts-to-defeat-covid-pandemic-121041301215_1.html) using Indian news agency The Press Trust of India Ltd., Indo-Asian News Service or IANS, and [Asian News International or ANI](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/asian-news-international-ani/).
When it comes to sourcing, they exclusively hyperlink to themselves without providing external links to credible sources. When covering world news about the USA, they cover it through the
[Associated Press](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press/). Finally, during the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://www.business-standard.com/coronavirus), they have reported accurately, supporting the pro-science consensus. In general, Business-Standard reports financial news factually and with a right-leaning bias favoring the government of India.
