Analysis / Bias
In 2021
[Reporters Without Borders](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reporters-without-borders/) ranked France 34/180 in their [Press Freedom Index.](https://rsf.org/en/france) The current President of France is [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.elysee.fr/en/emmanuel-macron), who leans [center-right.](https://www.france24.com/en/20180506-france-centrist-emmanuel-macron-governs-right-wing-french-president) [Read our profile on France’s Media and Government.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france-media-profile/)
In review, RFI (Radio France Internationale) publishes articles with minimal emotionally loaded language, such as this concerning President Macron:
[“Macron plan to slash France’s wealth tax clears key hurdle](http://www.rfi.fr/en/economy/20171012-macron-plan-slash-frances-wealth-tax-clears-key-hurdle).” Further, RFI equally covers the opposition conservative right-wing party Les Républicains [“2020: does the right Jacob have a future?”](http://www.rfi.fr/fr/france/20200102-2020-france-politique-droite-republicains-christian-jacob-avenir) and La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) far-left party leader Mélenchon: [“France: Mélenchon believes that pension reform can revive the left.”](http://www.rfi.fr/fr/france/20191219-france-reforme-retraites-peut-relancer-gauche-jean-luc-melenchon)
On the issues such as immigration, RFI’s coverage is poorly sourced and presents a negative tone:
[“France should send home more illegal immigrants, says report.”](http://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200505-france-should-send-home-more-illegal-immigrants-says-audit-migration-policy) In this article, RFI refers to “a report”; however, they don’t link to the report. When it comes to sourcing, RFI often hyperlinks to itself and credible sources through quotes and links such as [AFP news agency](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/afp-agence-france-presse/), fcc.gov., le monde, [France24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/), [who.int](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/world-health-organization-who/), and gouvernement.fr. RFI also uses factually mixed sources such as [scmp.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/south-china-morning-post/) and biorxiv.org. When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with emotionally loaded language, such as in this article [“Trump’s Twitter war turns against Twitter itself”](http://www.rfi.fr/en/science-and-technology/20200529-trump-s-twitter-war-turns-against-twitter-itself-us-civil-liberties-social-media); however, coverage is balanced. The news is generally reported mostly factually with a slight right-center lean editorially.
