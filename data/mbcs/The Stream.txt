History
[Founded in 2015](https://lifetoday.org/connect/words-of-life/welcome-to-the-stream/) by Christian Televangelist James Robison and not confused with [Al Jazeera’s](http://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/) program called the Stream. The Stream is an online news and opinion website that is overtly Christian. According to their [about page](https://stream.org/us/), “The Stream is a national daily championing freedom, smaller government, and human dignity. Offering both original content and the best from across the web, The Stream challenges the worst in the mainstream media while offering a rich and lively source for breaking news, inspiration, analysis, and entertainment.” [Read our profile on the United States government and media.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-states-media-profile/)
Funded by / Ownership
The website is owned by
[Life Outreach International Association of Churches](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/75-2684727), Inc., which routinely has [over $50 million annually](https://lifetoday.org/ways-to-give/financial-accountability/). These primarily come from individual donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Stream reports news from a Christian Right perspective, such as this:
[Old Friend of Trump Makes the Case: He’s Not Racist!](https://stream.org/old-friend-of-trump-makes-the-case-hes-not-racist/), which is written by Mike Huckabee, who has an abysmal track record with [facts](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/mike-huckabee/). Virtually all stories favor the right and advocate for Christianity with zero regards for science. For example, with [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/), all articles at the least deny the consensus on impact and outright deny the human influence.
They also are opposed to
[evolution](https://stream.org/evolution-fooled-believing-god-wink-wink/) and frequently report negatively on [homosexuality](https://stream.org/homosexual-episcopalian-calls-trumps-christianity-hypocritical/). They also make claims such as tying [eugenics to minimum wage](https://stream.org/eugenics-plot-minimum-wage/). Besides promoting pseudosciences such as human-influenced climate change denial and creationism, they also promote [conspiracy theories](https://web.archive.org/web/20181119170920/https://stream.org/evidence-piling-up-that-seth-rich-leaked-dnc-emails-to-wikileaks/) such as the debunked Seth Rich- [Wikileaks](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wikileaks/) conspiracy.
