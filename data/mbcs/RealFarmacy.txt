Analysis / Bias
In review, RealFarmacy is a health news website that promotes both
[conspiracies](https://realfarmacy.com/aviation_fuel_toxic_lead_heavy_metals_pollution/) and mostly pseudoscience. For example, many articles on this website promote [anti-vaccination propaganda](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/) such as this: [Proof That It Is Actually Vaccinated People Who Are Spreading Communicable Disease.](https://realfarmacy.com/proof-that-it-is-actually-vaccinated-people-who-are-spreading-communicable-disease/) This article cites the credible [Kaiser Health News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/kaiser-family-foundation/) and then turns to right-wing conspiracy theorist [Alex Jones](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/infowars-alex-jones/) for analysis. RealFarmacy also publishes [miracle cancer cures](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-alternative-cancer-treatments/) and prevention such as this: [Manuka Honey: Improves Sleep, Boosts Immunity, Prevents Cancer, and Is a Natural Antibiotic](https://realfarmacy.com/manuka-honey-improves-sleep-boosts-immunity-prevents-cancer-and-is-a-natural-antibiotic/). In case you were wondering, [there isn’t evidence](https://theconversation.com/science-or-snake-oil-is-manuka-honey-really-a-superfood-for-treating-colds-allergies-and-infections-78400) that Manuka Honey prevents cancer. Some other Pseudoscience topics you will find on RealFarmacy are humans being poisoned by [chem trails](https://realfarmacy.com/aviation_fuel_toxic_lead_heavy_metals_pollution/), [Fluoride alarmism](https://realfarmacy.com/fluoride-pineal-stone/), and most commonly how [deadly GMO’s](https://realfarmacy.com/scientists-find-cancer-deaths-twice-high-gmo-communities/) are to humans. In general, this site [disrespects science](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-gmo-dangers/) to such a degree it is less than non-credible.
