Analysis / Bias
The content of Exopolitics.org centers around the study of the political implications of an extraterrestrial presence on Earth. This field, known as
[exopolitics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48505175), is not widely recognized in mainstream academic or political discourse and often intersects with theories many would classify as [conspiracy theories](https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-conspiracy-aca342e7af99ab5e096ebda3b57fe605). The site presents largely speculative information and often lacks empirical evidence commonly accepted in scientific and academic communities.
The articles, webinars, and research papers on Exopolitics.org demonstrate a firm conviction in extraterrestrial influence on global affairs, covert space programs, and related concepts. As exemplified by the podcast
[“The Cabal, Black Magic & Extraterrestrial Life,”](https://exopolitics.org/the-cabal-black-magic-extraterrestrial-life/) these perspectives extend beyond the scope of conventional political and scientific analysis, posing a challenge in categorizing using standard political bias metrics. Regarding factual accuracy, Exopolitics primarily relies on unverified claims and personal beliefs, particularly those of Dr. Salla and contributors. Despite being presented sincerely, these claims lack the rigorous verification, peer review, and empirical evidence that define credible academic and scientific sources.
Similarly, the content of the video
[“Exopolitics & the 2nd American Revolution”](https://exopolitics.org/new-webinar-exopolitics-the-second-american-revolution/) suggests that Trump plans to use America’s secret technologies to counteract the Deep State’s influence. The narrative implies that former president Trump’s actions are part of a larger effort to restore the American Republic and initiate a new era of global prosperity. This perspective aligns with certain pro-Trump narratives often found in conspiracy theories, which portray him as playing a significant role in combating a so-called Deep State.
Given the unconventional nature of its content, Exopolitics.org caters to a niche audience that is interested in or open to alternative narratives about
[extraterrestrial](https://podcasts.google.com/search/EXOPOLITICS%20TODAY%20with%20Dr.%20Michael%20Salla) influence on Earth. In general, they promote right-leaning conspiracy theories and pseudoscience and are not always factual, as evidenced by failed fact checks.
