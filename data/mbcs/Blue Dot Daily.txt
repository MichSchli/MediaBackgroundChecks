Analysis / Bias
In review, Blue Dot Daily is a news and opinion blog that reports with an extreme left wing bias. All stories favor the left and utilize loaded language such as this:
[Trump goes nuts after his favorite network airs revealing info about him](https://www.bluedotdaily.com/trump-goes-nuts-after-his-favorite-network-airs-revealing-info-about-him/). This story is not sourced at all. In another loaded emotional article, [Trump caves, infuriates his base with lame compromise – Pelosi says Nope!](https://www.bluedotdaily.com/trump-caves-infuriates-his-base-with-lame-compromise-pelosi-says-nope/), the only source used is a tweet. In general, all stories favor the left and denigrate the right through the use highly biased wording.
