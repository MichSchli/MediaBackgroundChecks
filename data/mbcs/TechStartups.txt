History
[Founded in 2017](http://whois.domaintools.com/techstartups.com), TechStartups is a website publishing news about technology start-ups, science, and medicine. According to their [about page](https://techstartups.com/about-us/), “Our goal is to help tech startup companies, especially the underdogs, find customers, funding, mentors by connecting them to the right investors, early adopters, decision-makers and resources to grow their companies. Techstartups.com is also a platform for you to explore exciting and new products from innovative startups and be part of their success stories.”
The website completely lacks transparency as they do not list author names, ownership, or how they are funded.

Analysis / Bias
In review, TechStartups publishes under the categories News, Press Releases, Product Reviews, Crowdfunding Campaigns, and Startup Jobs. For this review, we will focus on their news reporting. TechStartups does not perform investigative reports but rather summarizes news from other sources. There is minimal use of loaded language in headlines like this:
[Amazon to hire an additional 75,000 full and part-time employees as demand rises due to coronavirus](https://techstartups.com/2020/04/13/amazon-hire-additional-75000-full-part-time-employees-demand-rises-due-coronavirus/). This story is appropriately sourced to Amazon.
Since the Covid-19 pandemic, TechStartups has been reporting heavily on the science and medicine of Corona. They frequently report on Hydroxychloroquine, which has not yet been tested or proven effective in the treatment of Covid-19. They have also made false and misleading statements such as this
[The United Arab Emirates has successfully used Hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus (COVID-19) patients, UAE health ministry says](https://techstartups.com/2020/04/12/united-arab-emirates-successfully-used-hydroxychloroquine-treat-coronavirus-covid-19-patients-uae-health-ministry-says/). They have also minimized Coronavirus as fearmongering such as this [MIT biologist says fear-mongering on coronavirus will go down as biggest fraud to manipulate economies](https://web.archive.org/web/20200410213842/https://techstartups.com/2020/03/12/mit-biologist-says-fear-mongering-coronavirus-will-go-biggest-fraud-manipulate-economies/). Finally, they have also published articles that point toward a conspiracy when counting deaths from covid-19 [New CDC data shows that hospitals counted heart attacks as COVID-19 deaths; CDC counts over 51,0000 patients actually died from heart attacks instead of COVID-19](https://techstartups.com/2020/10/27/new-cdc-data-shows-hospitals-counted-heart-attacks-covid-19-deaths-cdc-counts-510000-patients-actually-died-heart-attacks-instead-covid-19-deaths/).
Editorially, TechStartups does not publish opinion-based political content; however, they tend to favor former President Trump with loaded headlines such as this
[President Trump doubles down on antimalaria drugs Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin even as FDA and CDC fail to help Americans suffering from coronavirus](https://techstartups.com/2020/03/21/president-trump-doubles-antimalaria-drugs-hydroxychloroquine-hcq-azithromycin-even-fda-cdc-fail-offer-help-coronavirus-patients/). Further, they frequently report on [clean energy](https://techstartups.com/category/energy/) and support the consensus that [climate change](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-climate-change-denialism/) is human-influenced. In general, they lean right and frequently promote misinformation and conspiracy theories.
