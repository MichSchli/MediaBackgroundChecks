History
Founded in 2013, The Blue Route is a news and opinion website that presents information from a liberal perspective. The website features a tagline that reads “Careening toward a more progressive future.” According to their
[about page](http://theblueroute.org/about/), they state they are “political commentary, news, and current events network.” They further report “While we come from the left side of the political spectrum, we welcome opinion and commentary from both sides.” The website does not list an editor or disclose ownership.
In 2016, we evaluated The Blue Route under a different domain, therefore this serves as an update to the original review.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Blue Route is primarily a left-leaning opinion blog with story selection that consistently favors the left. News stories are appropriately separated from Op-Eds and typically utilize moderately loaded emotional language such as this:
[I am the straw man: a closer look at Trump’s plastic straw campaign](http://theblueroute.org/i-am-the-straw-man-a-closer-look-at-trumps-plastic-straw-campaign/). This story is appropriately sourced to [CNBC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnbc/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/) and [Futurism.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/futurism/). News stories with the Op-Ed tag are more opinion based and generally support progressive/liberal positions such as this: [The Case For Impeachment](http://theblueroute.org/the-case-for-impeachment/). They also do not have a favorable opinion of President Trump, [Will 2020 Be About Trump Fatigue or Trump Numbness?](http://theblueroute.org/will-2020-be-about-trump-fatigue-or-trump-numbness/)
