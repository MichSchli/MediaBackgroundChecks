Analysis / Bias
In review, as of this re-review, the NPI website is minimally active with only 5 articles published in 2020. One of the latest articles from June 2020 focuses on Black Lives Matter from a negative perspective
[THE NEXT GREAT AWAKENING](https://nationalpolicy.institute/2020/06/27/the-next-great-awakening/). This article is sourced from tweets from Richard Spencer. In general, the content of The National Policy Institute advocates White Nationalism. [According to the SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2020/01/10/once-political-force-richard-spencer-and-national-policy-institute-go-quiet), they confirm that this organization is essentially dead in 2020: “An “alt-right” think tank run by one of the country’s most prominent white nationalists has mysteriously gone quiet and appears to be in disarray.”
In general, this appears to be an organization that promotes White Nationalism and racism.
