Reasoning: Extreme Right, Poor sourcing, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Lack of Transparency, Fake News
Country: Unknown
History
Founded in January 2020, ThePoliticalBrief.com is a conservative news and opinion website that completely lacks transparency on every level. First, there is not an about page, authors are not named and ownership is not disclosed, further the website does not offer a contact form. If you want to read further, I won’t spoil why they are Questionable.
Funded by / Ownership
ThePoliticalBrief.com does not disclose ownership and revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, ThePoliticalBrief does not really produce original news content but rather re-posts from other poor questionable sources. For example, this story that contains far right loaded language, is actually from a Questionable source called the
[Patriot Journal](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/patriot-journal/): [Rand Paul Gives Wimpy Republicans His Ultimatum – Stand Up For Trump Or You Are Going To Lose In 2020.](https://thepoliticalbrief.com/?p=66) In fact, it seems most or all of the stories are coming the Patriot Journal. It is almost like this is a new sister/brother site for the Patriot Journal. Luckily, not all content comes from the Patriot Journal, some comes completely un-sourced from ThePolitcalBrief, such as this: [New Clinton Foundation Leak Spells Doom For Bill And Hillary Clinton](https://thepoliticalbrief.com/?p=49). As usual this conspiracy is not sourced. In general, this website is not credible on any level.
