Analysis / Bias
The Harvard International Review categorizes articles by geographical regions and topics such as Agriculture, Business, Cybersecurity, and Public Health, each providing an in-depth overview. For instance, the ‘Human Rights’ section includes articles like
[“The Limitations of Humanity: Differential Refugee Treatment in the EU,”](https://hir.harvard.edu/the-limitations-of-humanity-differential-refugee-treatment-in-the-eu/) which critiques refugee treatment, emphasizing social justice and equality; while these concepts are not exclusive to any one ideology, they are often associated with left-leaning views. It also uses strong language like “unwritten laws of basic human decency” to imply the EU’s unjust actions.
In the Defense section, the article
[“The Latest in a Long Line: Ukraine’s International Legion and a History of Foreign Fighters”](https://hir.harvard.edu/the-latest-in-a-long-line-ukraines-international-legion-and-a-history-of-foreign-fighters/) delves into foreign fighters volunteering in [Ukraine](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ukraine-media-profile/) during its conflict with [Russia](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/russia-media-profile/). While it provides historical context, the author’s use of terms like “unwavering devotion,” “courage,” and “commendable trait” casts the foreign fighters aiding Ukraine in a positive light. Further, HIR often employs emotionally loaded language in its titles, such as “ [When Rights Slip Through the Cracks of Culture: Women’s Rights and Justice in Nigeria—Or Lack Thereof,” ](https://hir.harvard.edu/when-rights-slip-through-the-cracks-of-culture-womens-rights-and-justice-in-nigeria-or-lack-thereof/)which can influence readers’ perceptions and pre-determine their stance on the issue even before they delve into the article’s content.
When it comes to sources, HIR uses a variety of outlets, including the
[NY Times](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/), reliefweb.int, [Deutsche Welle (DW) News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/dw-news/), immigrationlab.org, news.stanford.edu, [The Guardian](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/), [ Al Jazeera](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-jazeera/), [Vox](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/), [New America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-america/), [France24](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/france24/), unhcr.org, [Council on Foreign Relations](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/council-on-foreign-relations/), [Washington Post](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-post/), [Voice of America](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/voice-of-america/), [The Independent UK](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/), gov UK, [wearethemighty.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/we-are-the-mighty/), and [Human Rights Watch](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/human-rights-watch/). Some of these sources are known for their highly factual reporting, while others have a mixed reputation. In general, HIR is fact-based and holds moderately left-leaning political perspectives.
